0	abortion	Using your 'logic' then every woman of child bearing age must be constantly pregnant because not fertilizing every one of her developed eggs would mean the 'death' of a potential human being or that every man's ejaculate should be preserved because each sperm could result in a 'potential' human.Again, this issue will never be resolved because I don't consider   abortion   'murder'.  To me an embryo is a potential person but the woman IS the person therefor her rights and her health are paramount. End of discussion.  Don't believe in abortion...don't have one.  	FAVOR

You might as well say that the solution for our health care system is for people to just stop getting sick.  The housing crisis can easily be solved by everyone being more responsible with their money.I live in the real world, and in the real world criminalizing abortion does not help unborn babies, no matter how innocent.  It merely makes abortion unsafe.  I welcome your comments on the issue of how criminalizing abortion actually causes the loss of more lives.

7	abortion	"Actually, you're not allowed to make up definitions of words to suit your argument or your prejudice. Words like 'life' or 'potential' already have meanings, and your redefinitions don't help the matter. My use of the word 'potential' was employing the definition given by a dictionary, to whit:""The range of capabilities that someone or something has; powers or resources not yet developed or made use of.""But, since your argument is tied so heavily into your personal definitions, let's see where they lead us:o According to your definition, my appendix cell would not qualify for human rights because it would take 'tremendous amounts of human intervention' to make it into a developing embryo.o In that case, I presume that you would not accord human rights to an embryo (or a child?) produced via artificial insemination, in vitro fertilisation or single sperm injection. Is that right? These require 'tremendous amounts of human intervention', and some techniques have only become possible in the last few years. Presumably you'd have no objection to even late-term   abortion   of a fetus resulting from these techniques.o And, according to another definitions of yours, 'a sperm will also not become a human'. No? What if I took sperm cells - perhaps from two different men - extracted the chromosomes from each, combined them, injected the full complement into a denucleated ovum and caused it to start dividing? That's not a human baby either, according to you - so I can do pretty much whatever I like to it, right? I bet it'll taste like chicken.You don't have to struggle with the underlying morality thrown up by these entirely plausible - if a little premature - scenarios. If you really believe that a sperm+ovum is a human being, I doubt you have the 'capacity'. That's another word like 'potential'. Make of it what you will."	FAVOR
8	abortion	"Yes, you are absolutely right, it is illegal to kill a child, but just because it a simple ""cluster of cells"" in the early stages of pregnancy, does that give us any further right to destroy it?

You have commited murder!I instantly know the reply to that statement, after all, it's just an egg, so therefore there isn't any developed life growing inside... yet! It doesn't matter how far the stages of development have gone, because there is ultimately going to be a child, and forcing an early abortion is the prevention of life, and in my eyes, is nothing short of an abortion at say the six month stage of a human pregnancy.By the way, if I may add this, then I would say that your view on the ""potential bs,"" and how we should ""outlaw masterbation,"" is either incredibly misguided, or incredibly stupid. Need I remind you that there are several billion sperm cells in each male. So, how many sperm cells are produced during the process of masterbation?

9	abortion	Look at it this way: should a human life suffer because of the mistakes of their parents? I mean, you're saying a human shouldn't suffer death because the parents conceived the child against their wills. My issue is, a) a fetus isn't a human and I have a hard time with people comparing fetus's to a newborn with a brain. b) The consequences of those parens having a child when they can't even afford to take care of it, not just financially, but probably mentally and emotionally, only leads for that child, with feelings, and a current life, to suffer. I think they're two totally different things: fetus vs child. I understand the empathatic thoughts of abortion, but I believe it hurts a hell of a lot more seeing kids abused and abandoned than it does to see a fetus aborted.	AGAINST

13	abortion	Yes the majority rules but our founding documents are there to protect the minority from the excesses of the majority. In other words, What makes our constitution and the bill of rights different is that there are limits to what a majority can do. States do have individual rights but only up to a certain point. Since Roe v Wade protects the privacy of the individuals in relation to   abortion  , states do not have the right to act against it, just as (to use an absurd example) no state, today, could legally allow any form of slavery to be practiced. We have federal laws against it. Regards to a previous post of yours:It's hard to follow the logic of those against choice, with few exceptions. The reason is, it is so selective and based on this one aspect: abortion, a question, that in a real sense, really only has direct implications on the females of our society (I'm only talking about the ability to produce life since men can't. I am not referring to raising and rearing of a child and all the implication that has on both men and women in terms of the financial, mental / physical well being of the child). But if defining life and protecting life is so important why do we put so many restrictions on dealing with the question.Here's a list:1) the first cause of life. If life is a continual process why stop at the fertilization of the egg by the sperm? My sperm is life in potential. A woman's egg is life in potential. Yet, nature has the female eject unused eggs every month. And well, men...2) Many fertilized eggs are naturally aborted against people's will and we have many techniques for helping them although some of them will have to live their lives without being able to bear children. Why should we make an exception for the induced abortions and force people to have babies they don't want to have?3) Why is only human life so important when there is a strong interconnectedness to all life on the planet?4) What about war and the death penalty - both are cases where we justify the taking of life - how will our future constitutional amendment about life affect these things?I'm sure there are more things but this a good place to start when trying to define the philosophical and moral attitudes we should have about life.

14	abortion	A pro-choice position on any issue should maximize the number of free choices, present and future. The pro-choice position on abortion fails to maximize the number of free choices because it unilaterally eliminates the future free choices of individuals aborted.

15	abortion	In the abstract, it is morally permissible to vote for a pro-abortion candidate. Just as in the abstract, capital punishment is morally permissible when there exists no other option to protect society. In reality, the abstract conditions that would make either voting for a pro-abortion candidate or utilizing capital punishment rarely exist. Unlike capital punishment, abortion is always wrong and is a non-negotiable principle.Pope Benedict XVI is using the established moral reasoning prinicple of cooperation with evil to make his statement. Let us rigorously apply this principle to evaluate the current election:I want to evaluate the action of voting for a pro-abortion candidate, specifically Obama, using the principles of cooperation with evil.Let me first state my premises: Abortion is an intrinsic evil. It is never justified. It cannot be tolerated. Barack Obama supports abortion as is evidenced by his past senate votes and 100% NARAL rating, his endorsement by Planned Parenthood, and his promise to sign the radical Freedom Of Choice Act as one of his first official acts as president. An astute and very precise legal analysis of the dire ramifications of the Freedom of Choice Act can be found here. (       ) It can also be assumed that Obama will support US funding of abortions as part of foreign aid packages as well as the performance of abortions on military installations. In addition, it can be assumed that he will appoint Supreme Court justices who are sympathetic to Roe v Wade (in spite of the fact that many legal minds have denounced the legal thinking of this ruling). Therefore, the election of Barack Obama will cause the increased vulnerability to abortion of the unborn on a world-wide basis. This is an intrinsic evil.The question is whether or not it is morally licit to vote for Barack Obama. The first step is to decide if a vote for Barack Obama is formal or material cooperation with the intrinsic evil of abortion. If one is voting for Obama specifically because he supports abortion it is formal cooperation. Formal cooperation with an intrinsic evil is always morally illicit. That was easy.What if you oppose abortion? Does electing Barack Obama contribute an essential component to the increased vulnerability to abortion of the unborn on a world-wide basis even though that is not your intent? I suggest it does, because not electing him would make this dramatic increased vulnerability impossible. This would make your cooperation immediate material cooperation. Immediate material cooperation with an intrinsic evil is also morally illicit.LetÕs just say for the sake of argument, that electing Barack Obama is not an essential requirement for the increased vulnerability to abortion of the unborn. Though this will be the result of Barack ObamaÕs election, the voter does not intend this result. Therefore, such cooperation by electing Barack Obama would be considered mediate material cooperation. Such cooperation can only be tolerated if all four of the following conditions exist:1.    the cooperators act (voting for Obama) is itself morally good or indifferent2.    the cooperator does not intend the evil (making the unborn more vulnerable to abortion) of the principle agent (Obama)3.    the good effect is not achieved by means of the evil4.    the good effect is proportionate to the bad effectIt is condition 4 that makes the cooperation (voting for Obama) morally illicit. There is no proportionate reason to tolerate the increased vulnerability to abortion. You can see a very long list here (        of all the bishops )who have spoken to this.Therefore, using well-established principles of moral reasoning, I can confidently say it is morally illicit to vote for Barack Obama.

If you say the government has a right to decide what you with your body parts you would be forced to endure the painful process of bone marrow transplant.  While it is indeed a sad fact that   abortion   occurs, it's only logical to say we cannot make the choice for a woman in regards to her womb.  We cannot govern another's body parts based on emotional appeals.  We cannot govern your kidney or my bone marrow based on emotional appeals that doing so will save lives.

25	abortion	Hello there.Just some food for thoughts:You say that the woman have the right not to be pregnant. I agree with you. Let's take the rape victims out of the equation for a moment (they count for less than 1% of all abortions).How does a woman get pregnant? By having sex with a man. What is the possible outcome of a etherosexual sexual intercourse (as there are no 100% birth control methods) ? A new life. As we all are entitled to assume the responsability of our actions, shouldn't we expect the mother that chose to have sex to now take care of this new life that bears no responsability in existing?Now for the rape victims: as told these abortions count for less than 1% of the total.My thought here is that in the rare case a woman gets pregnant in a rape she has suffered a disgusting violation of some of her most valued rights. To discover to expect a child from the man who raped you must be very hard to accept. This said, we have to ask ouselves this question: how is an   abortion   going to help forget the trauma, isn't it even worse to have an abortion? Wouldn't it remind the patient of the terrible thing that happened to her?. Isn't this abortion going to add a new sense of guiltiness on the victim? To abort in a case of a rape is to kill an innocent human being by the less human method available while to retain the baby is to give birth to a new life.

People who are prolife just can't seem to grasp that neither the Supreme Court nor those who choose   abortion   are ""forcing their morality"" on people who are against abortion. If there were such things as forced abortions you would have an argument, but this is not the case. Roe vs Wade allows women to CHOOSE abortion. It also allows people to choose NOT to have an abortion. The problem is that Prolifers cannot let other people make choices they do not agree with. It's a simple concept: If you are against abortion,fine, don't have one. But don't tell me that my choice to have one ""forces my morality"" on you.  Although we can't all be constututional scholars, I do wish people making these arguments would actually read about Roe vs Wade and the related decisions before and since 1973, the 19th century Comstock laws, etc. Then and only then will you truly grasp the degree of oppression historically suffered by females in the US. Remember it has been less than 100 years since we achieved status as full citizens  with the right to vote.   Keep in mind that in 1963, Griswold vs. Connecticut struck down Connecticut's ban on all birth control. You say Roe vs Wade was ""not upholding constitutional   law  ."" That's a rather general statement where law is very, very precise. The big change that ocurred with Griswold vs. Connecticut, which is basically the precursor to Roe vs. Wade, is that a ""right to privacy"" was interpreted to exist in the ""living""   constitution  . This is the   legal   grounds that is challenged, even today. This means that if the prolife movement wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade,in effect saying that the constitution does not guarantee a right to privacy,  they will have to overturn Griswold vs. Connecticut on same basis, thereby allowing states to ban all forms of birth control. Most prolife people don't seem to understand this legal concept, and it is my observation that many of prolife leaders who do understand it are indeed against birth control also, but not nearly as vocal about it because that is a very unpopular prospect, based on deeply ingrained misogynist traditions in all three of the world's great religions. ""Fundamentalists' in all three religions are the problem,  make the most noise, and are frighteningly similar in misogynistic ideology. As a lively but ugly example,few prolifers know also about the outcry from fundamentalist Christians when epidurals for obstetric pain were introduced. They denounced epidurals since women were supposed to ""suffer in childbirth"" for Eve's part in Original Sin (Genesis.) Are the more radical among them really so different from the Taliban? I don't think so.The real question you need to answer is ""Does the government have the right to break down my door and supervise the choices I make in my bedroom, tell women that their male dominated government has decided that if they have sex, married or not, they must be prepared to have a child?""

Premarital sex: Sex that occurs before marriage. views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted. Generally I think of premarital sex as occurring within a relationship. If you're talking about casual, random sex, then your argument may hold some weight. But in the context of a relationship, there is a lot more at stake than personal pleasure via sex. Homosexuality: Sexual desire for those of the same sex. An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you.  Wait....whaT? Where exactly are you getting this? Pornography: Sexual media that satisfies urges of those who cannot get laid as often as they'd like. The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them. Hustler is viewed as an object for personal pleasure to be discarded. Not the people themselves. Soft porn: Sexy people doing sexy thingsTed Bundy: Serial killer Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of .  Turned to violent sexuality (more often detective books portraying sexual violence than pornography) after an inability to relate to humanity. I'm skipping around on your other arguments because I'm not in the mood for an essay, so bear with me. Find me the ""so many"" homosexuals who can walk away from the lifestyle and never go back and I'll find you a group of people who have lied to themselves to make society happy. Laws should be based on the good of society, not on your morals. About sex ed, you're naive if you think we can leave it to the hands of the parents. You may be a responsible parent who plans to teach your children about sex, but many are not. We owe a responsibility to every child to give them the tools necessary to make the right choices when the time comes. Whether that's abstention or contraception, only they can make that choice.

But those events can't happen without their host bodies first being born, so maybe it should be the grandparents' conception of the earliest parent. But then you run into the same issue and it regresses infinitely.Conception is certainly a choice and a point in time, but to claim that it is the only logical answer is utter inanity. Just as a fertilized egg is a component of a human finally being born, so are millions of other factors, many including the internal environment, incubation and nourishment of a fetus inside of a woman. To say that a fertilized egg *is* life would to be say that an engine *is* a vehicle. It simply isn't sufficient to produce a human.As long as we're talking about logic, we may as well examine actual logical constructs. A fertilized egg at the point of conception is a *necessary* condition for human life, but not a *sufficient* condition. As any logician knows, a consequence cannot come about without *all* necessary conditions (and at least one of them or an additional one being sufficient). Under this model, life could be defined as the point at which all necessary conditions (and at least one sufficient condition) have been fulfilled. Logically, that probably puts the event at the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the mother.Obviously that's not the only possibility for when ""life"" begins because the question is terribly broadÑafter all, sperm are most certainly alive. This is also not the best criteria for drawing a line for   abortion  , but it's indisputably more logical than the original author's weak and baseless claim.There are more pertinent questions to be asked in the abortion debate beyond this one, such as ""When does a fetus achieve independent brain function?"".

81	abortion	I've been pregnant 5 times, if that means that I am uniquely more qualified than a man to make a decision about something that relates to women.Abortion kills a human offspring at the stage of human development called either embryo or fetus.  That doesn't make it non-human.  Infant, child, adolescent, and adult are names for other stages of human development.An embryo has, from the very moment of conception, it's own unique DNA.  That is a scientific fact.  It is not a part of a woman's body but a unique being that happens to be developing in the place where it was designed (by God or nature, your choice) to develop until the time it is ready for birth.It absolutely does affect everyone if   abortion   is legal.  There are many consequences to society, whether financial (when taxpayer funds are used to fund it, or in dealing with the medical consequences that often follow) or not (as in the higher rate of child abuse that we have in the time that abortion has been legal).I support groups that help women when they are in crisis pregnancy situations.  If a woman has a financial or emotional circumstance that may cause her to think that abortion is her only choice (or if she is pushed into an abortion by a boyfriend, husband, parent, or someone else), we as a society should stand up and let her know that there are ways that we can help her besides telling her that killing her child is the only option.  The way to help a woman with a crisis pregnancy is to help her solve the crisis.Abortion is a betrayal of women - even early feminists like Susan B. Anthony believed that.  Those who didn't are women like Margaret Sanger, who was a proponent of eugenics and a racist who supported Hitler.	AGAINST
82	abortion	Abortion is the killing of a child. No one should be willfully killed, be it at 1 week or 100 years. When I had my first ultrasound with my son, I was 5 weeks pregnant, which means I had become pregnant 3 weeks prior. My son had a heartbeat. How can anyone anyone anyone stop a beating heart on purpose? Your decision should happen BEFORE you find yourself in this position. If it is ok to abort, why do those who do so end up so destroyed for the rest of their lives? It's because they know they killed a human and that will rest on their hearts for life. If only their child had such an opportunity. For those of you who wrote that there is no God, and were angered by such a defense, I will pray for you. Because without faith, you really have nothing.

84	abortion	"Ah, now we get to the core of your argument. Sex is a deviation if it's not for the purpose of child-making? So basically, sex is not for pleasure, only for babies? Gay sex is wrong, then? Or sex between infertile married couples? Laws should be based on protecting other people, not on morality. Just like drugs, gambling, and prostitution ought to be legal, so long as those activities do not hurt others. Your statement that ""sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties"" is laughable. Many people enjoy sex before marriage and find it to be an enriching part of their relationships. Just because you don't doesn't mean they are wrong. What effect am I numb to? Orgasm? Hardly. ""It is a uniue and separate human being that you happen to be hosting""--like a parasite? So you should be able to choose whether or not to play host for 9 months. Stop trying to relate my examples to murder. You and I both know the distinct differences between killing a group of cells that live within you and that you are ultimately responsible for and killing an independent person. You claim that adoption is the ""only ethical choice"" for parents who are unable to care for their children, but this distinctly ignores two of the possible reasons I gave for abortion. 1-Addicts cannot bring a healthy child to term, 2-Abused women cannot hide a pregnancy and then give a child up for adoption. It also assumes that there would be enough of a ""market"" for adopted children if abortion were suddenly banned. Rates of children being given up would sky rocket, but would rates of parents wanting to adopt also rise? Prohibition never works. Prohibition on alcohol didn't work. Prohibition on marijuana is not working. Prohibition on sex before marriage cannot and will not work. Prohibition fails. Period.Nobody is ""telling kids to have sex"". We're providing sexual education so that if they make that choice, they will be informed on how to be healthy and responsible. I can't believe you'd rather have them NOT be informed, on the logic that if they DON'T know how to have responsible sex that they'll simply choose not to have it. Did you bother reading the study I linked to? I'll reiterate the key points of their findings. 1-Comprehensive sex education DOES reduce rates of pregnancy and STD's, 2-Comprehensive sex education DOES NOT increase rates of teenage sexual activity, 3-Abstinence only education DOES NOT reduce rates of teenage sexual activity. So, basically, the findings were that people are going to have sex, and try as you might, we can't dictate YOUR morality to them. Tricky thing about morals, they're all relative. If people are going to have sex, and IF abstinence only education has been proven to be ineffective at reducing rates of sex or pregnancy or STD's, then why would we continue to stick to it? To appease your moral beliefs? Again, laws are not, contrary to your belief, about morals. They are about people. And so long as sex is consensual, nobody needs protecting from it. Except perhaps you, since you so obviously find offense in the act of love. I suggest this. Teach YOUR children your moral beliefs regarding sex. But for the sake of society, let's teach all children (including yours) what it means to be responsible with regards to sex. Just in case they fall off the high bar you've set for them.

The premise is argued for, but, as I think, not well. Take, for example, the most common argument. We are asked to notice that the development of a human being from conception through birth into childhood is continuous; then it is said that to draw a line, to choose a point in this development and say ""before this point the thing is not a person, after this point it is a person"" is to make an arbitrary choice, a choice for which in the nature of things no good reason can be given.

Similar things might be said about the development of an acorn into an oak trees, and it does not follow that acorns are oak trees, or that we had better say they are...A newly fertilized ovum, a newly implanted clump of cells, is no more a person than an acorn is an oak tree.""

However, do such single celled organisms hold the same 'status' or value as the life of a fully formed human? Obviously not, otherwise just about every male would be convicted as a mass murderer. Thus, the question becomes, when does the life of the single celled organisms become ""human life""?This is a more interesting question. Is an organism defined as human according to physiology? If so, then is a person missing a limb less human than one with all four limbs? Well, that is absurd. Thus, the question of classification as human is not dependant on physiology. I would like to argue that it is thus dependant on DNA. So, at which point does an organism hold complete human DNA. It is at the point where the chromosomes from the sperm cell and the egg cell combine. It is at that stage, that human life begins.It is thus a logical conclusion that a fetus, from time of conception, should be considered a human, with equal value placed on it's life."	AGAINST

The head is the largest single part of a fetus, and is the most difficult to pass. Similar to giving birth, the passing of the head often causes excruciating pain, struggle, and sometimes damage to the Cervix and Vagina. Collapsing the skull eliminates these risks. As such, it can be argued that the collapsing of the skull of the unborn head of the fetus is a ""civilized"" measure in the way that it protects the mother from harm or the risk of harm. In other words, the infliction of pain and destruction on the fetus may be canceled out by the reduction in the pain and risk of permanent damage to the woman. "	FAVOR

118	abortion	"Babies and the (disabled) elderly are most certainly dependent, and rely upon the care of an adult in order to survive.  The difference, however, is that ANY competent adult can reasonbly meet their survival needs.  In the case of a fetus prior to somewhere between 21-23 weeks, it is not capable of survival outside the uterus in which it originally implanted (at least, not at this stage of our medical/technological development).  It is, in essence, a ""parasite"" (by strict medical definition) upon the mother's system.  It is reliant upon continued physical embedding within the mother's system to survive.  It is incapable of survival outside the uterus, EVEN IF another adult is willing to take on its feeding and care.  That is the difference between viability outside the uterus and non-viability outside the uterus.  For purposes of determining whose rights supercede whose, I believe that the mother's rights to her own body and to governing the processes of her own body supercede any rights of the fetus until such time as the fetus would be viable outside of the uterus.That said, if a mother is planning to terminate her pregnancy for reasons other than life or health, I believe this definitely should be done prior to viability outside the uterus AND should be done absolutely as early in the pregnancy as she is aware that she is pregnant, preferably within the first couple of weeks past her missed period.I would love to see technology developed which could take a fetus or embryo as far back as fertilization, and allow that fetus to be removed from the uterus at any time and to develop in vitro to full term.  If such technology were available, I would agree that there was no further use for   abortion   other than for fetuses incapable of survival outside the uterus for reasons of physical malformation, such as anencephaly.  I would also love to see a world which so focused on the PREVENTION of unwanted pregnancies, that abortion rates fell to zero because every pregnancy was a planned and wanted pregnancy.

121	abortion	You haven't given any reason to rule out conception as being sufficient, and you have allowed that it is necessary.  Miner's point was not that it was logically necessary that conception be considered the starting point- rather that it is 'logical' to err on the side of caution when potentially taking human life.  This is a non-technical use of 'logical', and he might have been better off to say 'rational'.  If you get past that point, then he is certainly right that if you wish to choose the most 'cautious' interpretation, then it would mean that you'd have to pick conception.

122	abortion	I used 'humanity' rather than 'personhood.'  I am not talking about having human DNA, which along with life, is present before conception as well as after. In the science that you are invoking, there is no such thing as new life - life is a continuum, as is the DNA that encodes it.  Human DNA by itself defines a cell as Homo sapiens, but does not make a cell a person. That is why we are trying to develop a term to describe what IS new, a new person. There is no single point in time, no switch that occurs where a developing human goes from having none of the characteristics of a person to having all of the characteristics of a person. That is the binary thinking that I am arguing against.In the miraculous process of going from 2 adult humans to 3 adult humans there are many intricate biological steps that all must be taken at the right time and in the right order. At every stage, there is life, and that life has human DNA. Along that path, the potential adult human is granted incrementally increasing rights - from none while it is still a sperm and egg to full rights at 18 years (or 25 if you want to rent a car). Many humans never make it, or get sick and lose some of these rights, or make mistakes and have these rights revoked. It is our job (as a society) to assign rights to humans at different stages of their existence. Rights to citizens, rights to criminals, rights to the insane, rights to children, rights to pregnant women, and rights to the unborn. I shudder to compress such complexity into a binary box built of DNA.	FAVOR

ThereÕs a huge difference.At some point morality needs to become the priority.

I thought so.Moral relativism vs. religion is a false alternative promulgated by religionists. Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand, provides the secular, absolute, rational basis for individual rights and the American system of government. It does so flawlessly, unlike religion, which has only ever caused an erosion of individual rights. Its ethics is fully secular. It is not based on moral relativism.

Which means you should not have government over any of your body parts.  The fact that there is a potential life means nothing.  It would not matter if men could carry a fetus.  The fetus is literally living off the carrier.

This, of course, might never happen, but it is not murder to retain the use of your body as you see fit.    It is entirely within your rights.

This is why I responded that morality can't be turned on and off to suit whatever fits Your argument at the time.  Why did talk about nature? ""I did not kill that person.

I'm not twisting anything....you're changing your words to suit yourself.But.To answer your question, you do not have that right.  If you are going to force a woman to go through a dangerous process because otherwise another person will die, it is equally moral to force anyone else to go through a dangerous process because otherwise a person will die.    Your logic says that a woman cannot retain the rights to her uterus because if she doesn't use those parts to give life, she is immoral.   By your logic, you cannot retain the rights to your body parts because if you don't use those parts to give life you are immoral.Deliberately killing someone and deliberately doing nothing and letting someone die IS the same thing.  You thought about the actions and the consequences beforehand for each of those things.  You weighed your options and made a decision.   The deciding factor in each case is you.  If all you have to do is push a button to save a life and you know it - you see it happening - you can push the button but you don't, you are deliberately killing that person.  If all you have to do is push a button and someone dies - you know this and you push it, you are deliberately killing that person.  There is no difference.  Your decision will kill a person.  ""Do I risk my own life by undergoing major surgery?""  Is there no risk in pregnancy? ""Am I willing to live my life with only one kidney and, should the other be damaged by any number of things, potentially die?""   Is there no potential for death in pregnancy? Can we not be damaged irreparably during pregnancy (I'm just assuming you're a woman. Forgive me if I'm wrong)?""What if I give up my kidney and then a member of my family needs one?""  No one has rights to their body, remember?  Someone else will be forced to give your family member a kidney.""I never said it was perfectly moral to sit by and do nothing when I could be saving a life, but that doesnÕt mean IÕm compelled to have all my spare body parts out.""

It doesn't matter if we're talking about forced birth or the forced donation of kidneys or bone marrow.  It's not a debate that those things ""save"" lives.  Do you have the right to govern your own body?This isn't a woman's issue for this very reason.

Our laws, without the belief in God to back them up, don't motivate many people to follow them. You state that society, religion and law all change over time (that's another absolute statement) but I have not seen morals change.  That is, I haven't seen people's attitudes about how they think they should be treated change.  No one thinks they should be lied to or cheated on or stolen from.  No one thinks others have the right to murder them. It seems to me you are basically saying that everything changes and it's all a matter of perspective so it's impossible to know anything.

142	abortion	While it may technically be alive from the moment of conception, it is irrelevant. I doubt you think life itself is sacred and should never be killed, because, and this may be an unreasonable assumption, you've probably washed your hands before and killed thousands of bacteria. I think human life is important, not sacred, but important. And some human lives are more important than others. Given the choice between saving a young, healthy child, and an old dying man, I would have to choose the child. The fact of that matter is that for most of the pregnancy, the fetus is not really a human. For a long time it is essentially just a ball of cells. It takes many months for it to be organized to the point where it truly is a human. The reason that I think abortion should be legal, especially in the case of rape, is that I believe that the choice of the mother, the health of the mother, and the happiness of the mother are more important than the right to live of a little ball of cells. That's all this decision is, a balance of rights.Here are all the rights doing battle: The right of the mother to choose what happens to her body, the right of the mother to be healthy because pregnancies can be dangerous, the right of the mother to not have to go through the emotional stress of giving birth and having a child, and the right of the baby to live. I will agree that at a certain point in time, the right of the baby to live supersedes the mother's rights. I don't believe it is okay to kill your child the day before it would be born, it can live and think on it's own, it is a human. But for about the first two trimesters, it isn't even aware of it's own existence and it is a very simple organism totally incapable of homeostasis and during this time period, the mother's rights are more important. If you think that the rights of a ball of a few dozen cells are more important than the right of a living adult to happiness, health, and choice, then you can have your opinion and I can have mine, no one is wrong or right. I just hope you can understand that when you say no abortion at any time under any circumstances, you are saying that the rights of a tiny clump of cells are greater than the rights of a fully grown, fully sentient human.

We are examining our abilitities, our life's goals, our financial prospects and current state, perhaps even whether this is a world ready for yet another mouth to feed --in short we are examining the wisdom of having and raising a child, not only by ourselves but others (I gave my daughter up for adoption when it was the only alternative to raising her myself, whch I could not realistically expect to do.

Moreover, if pregnant women traveled abroad, they would be able to have an abortion in a country where it was legal. Either the state takes the draconian measure of restricting freedom of movement, or it must admit that its law is unworkable in practice and abolish it. The Ôthird wayÕ of tacitly accepting foreign terminations would render hypocritical the much-vaunted belief in the sanctity of life.

There is not a unanimous tradition on this point and authors are as yet in disagreement. For some it dates from the first instant; for others it could not at least precede nidation. It is not within the competence of science to decide between these views, because the existence of an immortal soul is not a question in its field. It is a philosophical problem from which our moral affirmation remains independent for two reasons: (1) supposing a belated animation, there is still nothing less than a human life, preparing for and calling for a soul in which the nature received from parents is completed, (2) on the other hand, it suffices that this presence of the soul be probable (and one can never prove the contrary) in order that the taking of life involve accepting the risk of killing a man, not only waiting for, but already in possession of his soul.A Catholic who may think that there is room in Catholic theology for the ""acceptance of policies that favor access to the full range of ""reproductive health options"", (on the contrary, are not healthy emotionally, physically or spiritually) you only need to read what the Church herself teaches on abortion and contraception.

152	abortion	"Dear Pepper:You asked: ""What evidence do you have that a fetus can not think? Later term fetuses definitely exhibit brain activity.""Brain activity is not thought. Every organism that has a brain, has brain activity. Cats have brain activity. So do rats and birds and dolphins and so forth. Brain activity per se is not the defining characteristic of thought. Thought is a complex set of identifications and integrations of two or more percepts, which means thought requires some perception of that which exists independent of one's own consciousness.  A fetus inside a womb has no material to be conscious of. One cannot be conscious when there is nothing to be conscious of. The evidence that a fetus cannot think lies in how it must function. By its nature, it relies on its host.  If, for instance, the host smokes or drinks, we know ""out here"" that this is not good for the fetus ""in there,"" but the fetus does not know that such things are bad for it. It cannot identify or evaluate the things the host sends to it.  It can only passively absorb what the host gives it. You wrote: ""A fetus most definitely has human DNA. It has a heartbeat. It has a brain and brain activity. It is, in scientific terms, every bit as much human as you are.""Not true.  A fetus does have the things you mentioned but none of it adds up to the human.  Human DNA or a heartbeat or brain activity are not defining characteristic of a human being.  The essential defining characteristic of a human being is conceptual consciousness. DNA is the building block of the physical organism, which includes the brain. You wrote: ""You are correct when you say a human being refers to a specific living organism of a specific kind. That specific kind is determined by its DNA. Fetuses are living, and they have human DNA. That makes them human.""No. As I indicated above, when one is discussing the human, one must consider the essential that differentiates the human from other mammalian life forms, which is rationality. The human is the rational animal. The rational animal alone has a conceptual consciousness.You asked: ""By what basis or by what evidence do you make the observation that a fetus has no mind, or that it has no independent conceptual consciousness? Please provide the evidence to support that comment.""I've already answered this above. You asked: ""What is the magical transformation that takes place in a matter of seconds that transforms a parasite into a human being?""There is no magic involved. The transformation involves essentially two fundamentals: existence and development.  Ordinarily, at a particular stage of its physical development, a mammalian organism is ejected from its host. At that moment, it is plunged into the entire array of things that make up the universe, including light and gravity and objects and so forth. The born organism cannot immediately perceive everything available to him. It takes considerably longer than a few seconds to ignite the operation of his consciousness. Upon birth it is still on the pleasure-pain principle.  He can sense discomfort and hunger and will react.  The fetus has a potential.  When it is born into a different environment, that potential is activated. But it takes him quite some time to learn to focus his eyes.  It takes even longer for him to sense that the object looking at him is ""good for me.""  It takes even longer for him to SAY ""mama.""  This is the nature of the development of a consciousness from the perceptual to the conceptual, which is unique to human beings. A conceptual consciousness cannot begin to function until it has material to be conscious of. It cannot have access to that material until its perceptual mechanism is activated and utilized.  It cannot activate and utilize the perceptual mechanism until it is born into an environment where there is material to perceive and be conscious of. So, we say: the fetus upon being born is now in an environment that supplies him with perceptual data, which enables him to develop his conceptual consciousness.  Ergo, he is now human. You wrote: ""Your argument is based on very simplistic terms . . .but it does nothing to change the facts that any   abortion   that is performed after 21 weeks is terminating a life that could very well have survived and gone on to a full, normal life and do great things.""Are you saying that if a fetus is terminated before 21 weeks, that's okay. You know it won't do great things.  But if it's terminated after 21 weeks, then you know that one is killing something that might do great things?In any case, this does not deal with the most important issue: A woman's individual rights. Why should a pregnant woman do what you want her to do?  Why should her rights be violated?  Why do you advocate using force upon human beings in the name of the human?  It does not make sense.

158	abortion	"You're confusing that statement to mean that fetus is part of her body.  That's not what we mean. We mean that the woman has the right to her womb (which is part of her body).  As you said ""Common sense concludes that nobody has the right to control the life or death of another person regardless of their location, age, or status (born or not).""  But if you really meant that, your own common sense would conclude that the fetus does not have the right to control the life of another person.   Since the fetus is inside the womb, the woman must live her life for that fetus.  She gives up the right to control her life because of the location of the fetus.  She must, even at risk to herself (and risk is not merely death, but also of stroke, hemmorrage, etc.), carry that unborn ""child"".  It IS unfortunate, but it the design of nature... ""God"", whatever you want to say... that the fetus is carried by the woman instead of being laid as an egg.  Wouldn't that be nice? Then the egg could be abandoned if she wanted and anyone having a problem with that could take up the responsibility of caring for it until it hatched (was born).  The problem with saying that a woman has the rights to her womb ignores the potential child. I think it perfectly ridiculous to say that a woman can have an   abortion   is the fetus is mature enough to survive outside the womb.  In fact, if it even close to being able to do so, the woman should not be allowed an abortion, but should have a c-section instead.  The whole thing is not wanting to be pregnant... for whatever reason.  So by having a different procedure done (and it really is about the same), the woman retains control over her body and the problem is solved of 100% death to the babe.  If the baby dies, it is only because it was not able to survive.  Note, I am not saying that the medical community must ignore it, rather that the woman is merely evicting something she doesn't want from her womb.  She has absolved herself of responsibility from whatever happens to that fetus.  Anyway.  The ego that says the life of one is more valuable probably depends on where you're standing.  Do you value the life of your child over the lives of 3,613 strangers?  Do you value your life above that of 3,613 strangers?  Of course you do.  We all place greater value upon those we love and care about.    Why is it unnatural to place greater value upon the rights of your womb than the rights of a stranger to use your womb as it wishes?   The woman who chooses an abortion is merely choosing the right to keep her womb empty.  The woman who chooses to remain pregnant is voluntarily giving up her rights, and her life, for the fetus.  One is not a bad choice, and one an evil choice... we say we have individual rights, but pregnancy blurs the lines because one individual is actually  inside  the other.   But the bottom line in this is that the woman utimately must be able to have control over her womb.   Being able to have an abortion legally protects not only that right, but also the health and safety of the woman to do what is already in her rights to do. "	FAVOR

The fate of her fetus is not the business of anyone except her and her doctor. 2: A fetus is not a human being, meaning terminating a pregnancy is not murder. For evidence of this consider whether a first or second trimester fetus could live on its own, without the asistance of the mother or medical technology. Also consider that the bible does not consider fetuses legal human beings (Exodus 21:22-25), so there is no religious argument supporting the pro life position. 3: People should not be punished for birth control failing, for being uninformed about how babies are made or for general immaturity. A baby is an extremely expensive thing, if two parents were unprepared financially or lack the maturity necessary to raise a child in modern times then a pregnancy could ruin the lives of not only the parents but of the child as well. 4: An unplanned pregnancy can have negative consequences not only for the mother, father and child, but also for the society they are a part of. If this family was not financially able to raise a child, the public ends up paying for them through welfare programs, etc...

You do not retain the right to you bone marrow, nor your blood, nor one of your kidneys, as those things don't belong to you. They can be taken at will whenever the need arises because the use will save a life.   Where you get this retarded analogy of shooting me with your hand, I'm not quite sure.  And that's a very good point.   If the government has the right to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her womb, then the government also has the right to tell a man what he can and cannot do with his sperm.  If the government wants it - they'll get it because you no longer retain the rights to whatever your body produces, or sustains.  The same for the eggs of the same woman.  The very point of dependency IS the umbilical cord.  You nor I are dependent for life upon anyone else.  If we cannot survive because we are too stupid to know what to do - that is our own fault.  I do not depend upon someone else to breathe for me, feed me, keep me warm, etc. You do not depend upon anyone else for the same things.  If someone wanted to attach themselves to you for nine months in order to live, you have every right to say ""Thank you, but no.""        The rights to your body parts are immutable. This doesn't mean you can do whatever you want to with your hands.  It means no one can take it away from you.  It doesn't mean you can spit on whomever you want to, it means no one can demand that you give them your spit or face jail and fines.  It means no one can take your bone marrow from you. It means you are not responsible for giving blood.  It means you do not HAVE to give your Aunt Judy a kidney nor anyone else for that matter.  It doesn't matter if someone else will live or die based on your choice.  YOU have the immutable right to your body.   It may be crappy that a person (or a potential person) will ""die""  or just not live because you choose to retain your rights, but fortunately for you - and everyone else - you have those rights.    The rights to my womb and vagina are immutable.  The rights to you testicals and what goes on in there are immutable.  If you say that because a life is at stake that a woman does not have the right to her body or any of its parts, you say our bodies are not our own.   In which case - I you had better be registered and prepared to donate your bone marrow, and your kidney.  You should have a living will that gives away your eyes, and your heart and whatever else is salvageable in the event you're made brain dead, or it's clear you won't live.

And, keeping it illegal doesn't stop abortions from happening. It never has. So instead of a legal procedure, being conducted in a safe environment, we're going to end up with a bunch of illegal abortions, in unsafe and unregulated environments.At the bare minimum abortion is the taking of one person's life.At the bare minimum, it's the destruction of an accumulation of cells.

187	abortion	While most of your argument is very good, I do have a problem with you denying that   abortion   to save the life of a mother cannot be valid if you believe the fetus to be a person.  If there is a car crash, and two people are somehow fused together in such a way that one will live and the other will die if seperated, but if left together both will die, then the doctor has a tough decision to make, but ultimately should make.  One must be saved and one must die.  This is the same scenario as if an abortion occured to save the life of the mother.  Being as the mother usually has a higher chance of survival, it is usually wise to save her rather than the baby.  Granted, at that point, it is the doctor's decision.  As far as the other extenuating circumstances, you are right, they have no justification.  I also disagree with your apparent belief that we should err on the side of liberty over life.  I would place life before liberty, and would rather risk denying someone a freedom they should have had to try and save someone's life than deny someone a life they should have had to try and save someone's freedom.

208	abortion	OK I agree about a new debate; any ideas?I do think I need to clarify something however and then I'll leave it at that.Sex with in the context of a lifelong heterosexual marriage is the ideal and proper function of sex. Any form of sexuality outside of that is dysfunctional and causes problems. As with anything when it is not used properly.I raised the issues of porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like as case studies of this principle. All of these are sexual expression outside of the proper context of sex and all of them cause problems; hence why I would classify them as dysfunctions.What does all this have to do with the abortion question? The fact that there is such a thing as this debate about abortion proves there is a problem. No problem, no debate. So here is the problem as I see it. Married couples don't have abortions. So who does then? those expressing themselves sexually outside the context of marriage. If this causes a problem (abortion) than we must say something is dysfunctional or unhealthy. We can't say it is the sexual act because that alone doesn't always cause problems. It has to be the context in which it occurs. Because sexual expression in one way is without problems and in another it causes problems. Or to put it another way; one is a healthy expression and the other is unhealthy. So to sum it all up; You will know whether something is healthy or dysfunctional by the fruit it produces. All the examples I gave including abortion are symptomatic (the fruit) of an underlying problem; sex outside it's proper context. But this does highlight a problem we in our culture suffer from. We have forgotten the principle of sowing and reaping. When you plant a tree you don't immediately get fruit, it takes time. So if we do something and don't immediately see bad results that doesn't mean there won't be any. It may take years before are actions bear fruit.So I hope you can see that I'm still debating the same issue. I'm going after the cause and not the symptom however. I also have been careful not to argue from religious reasons, although my convictions inform my reasons. So I would agree with you that people are biologically programmed to sexual desires and that sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship. But I would say, judging by the fruit, that there is a healthy and unhealthy expression of that sexuality. Maybe we could debate whether or not sex outside of marriage is unhealthy by looking at the fruit it produces.	AGAINST

It is, in scientific terms, every bit as much human as you are.You are correct when you say a human being refers to a specific living organism of a specific kind. That specific kind is determined by its DNA. Fetuses are living, and they have human DNA. That makes them human.By what basis or by what evidence do you make the observation that a fetus has no mind, or that it has no independent conceptual consciousness? Please provide the evidence to support that comment. What is the magical transformation that takes place in a matter of seconds that transforms a parasite into a human being?A human fetus, from as early as 21 weeks into development, is a fully functional human being. From that point forward they continue their growth and development to improve their chances of surviving on their own outside the womb. But that does not mean that they do not have everything that is required to live on their own at 21 weeks. Your argument is based on very simplistic terms; if you canÕt touch it, and you canÕt see it with your own eyes, then itÕs nothing more than a parasite. This makes it easier to morally justify terminating it, but it does nothing to change the facts that any   abortion   that is performed after 21 weeks is terminating a life that could very well have survived and gone on to a full, normal life and do great things.If youÕre really interested in the subject and not just trying to make excuses for why itÕs OK to abort a fetus at any point of itÕs development I would recommend the following site for an interesting read;       	FAVOR

Unless people on respirators are ""un-alive"", that would eliminate independence as a necessary condition.Warts, moles, and tumors are not germane.  They are just body tissue which may not be functioning normally.  A zygotes is not a part of the woman's body.A chunk of metal, if left alone, will remain a chunk of metal (or deteriorate).  A zygote, if left alone, will begin the process of developing into a person.  The argument that because something is not in a state now entails that we should treat it no differently than something which is not particularly likely to enter that state is irrational.  If a boulder were rolling down a hillside toward my car and I regarded it is merely another rock on a hill, then I would be foolish.Logic can point out that an argument is invalid, but it can't speak to the merit of a definition.

229	abortion	"Do you ever wonder where that first heart beat comes from? It just... POP... occurs.  What makes it do that?   It's kind of wondering why the big bang banged.  If you believe that the Big Bang even banged at all.  Or like wondering where ""God"" comes from, if your of that sort.  No one really knows yet....  I think that's interesting.  Apparently, it's inherent to these certain cells, but the exact cause as to why the heart begins to beat is unknown.  Except from     .r.html (okay, so it's practically all of it...!)""The electric stimulus that triggers the muscular portion of the heart, known as the myocardium, to contract is myogenic. This means that the contractions arise spontaneously within the myocardium itself, and propagate from cell to cell. Input from the central nervous system can modify the heart rate (the frequency of heart beats), but it does not initiate beats.The ability of cardiac myocytes (the cells that comprise the myocardium) to beat is an intrinsic property of these cells. In fact, myocytes removed from the early heart and grown in culture will beat sporadically, and if they become connected to each other, will then begin to beat rhythmically, in unison. As a functional organ, the heart begins to beat very early, even before it has assumed its final form. Interestingly, the heart begins to beat even before structures such as valves and septa (singular: septum; the muscular walls that divide the chambers) have formed! The initial contractions are peristaltic--that is, they proceed in a wave-like fashion along the length of the heart. Later, once the heart has matured and the conduction system has developed, the contractions proceed in an orderly, timed sequence through the different chambers.Because beating is an intrinsic property of the cardiac myocytes, exactly what causes the heart to begin contracting is essentially a cell biological question. Unfortunately, there is not yet a definite answer to this question. We are beginning to understand how cardiac myocytes are specified very early in development, long before the heart has even formed. And we are learning more about their differentiation--that is, how these cells, ***which initially are not any different from cells*** that will give rise to the stomach or to muscles in the arm, develop the characteristics that allow them to contribute to the beating heart. From research in these areas, it is clear that certain things are required in order for the heart to beat. For instance, cardiac myocytes must have contractile proteins, such as actin and myosin, that are properly assembled into a scaffold (known as a sarcom ere) that allows contraction to take place. In addition, these cells must have specialized structures called gap junctions, which allow them to communicate so they can beat together in a synchronized fashion. Thus, while it is clear that certain elements must be in place for the heart to beat, it is not yet clear what stimuli are responsible for initiating contraction.""FASCINATING!"	FAVOR

Unfertilized eggs & sperm don't have complete DNA; only half; and again, aren't complete organisms, only part of another organism.

Justice, Morality, and Ethics are inherently non-secular.  If our system were truly secular and based on the Enlightenment, there would be no reference to a Creator, and the First Amendment would never have included anything remotely pertaining to religion.As for the practice, where else do you get laws against murder, rape, and theft, except from religion?  Relativism holds no standard, for the one on trial can always say ""well that may be good for you but ...""Now you may object that the law isn't relative, but that which has a relativ basis is inherently relative.

That is, assuming we have the same definition of conception.With equal certainty, conception is not a sufficient condition for new lifeÑat least, if you define life as independent life. Without a mother to incubate a zygote into a fetus and eventually an infant, there is no independent new life. Simply remove the mother from the equation after conception to deduce that result.As for those who think that the zygote is already a new life, (not requiring that the life be independent, in other words), considering things like warts, moles and tumors each as new lives should lend to a different perspective. This isn't a completely absurd position to hold, but it is certainly eccentric and not one I feel compelled by.Then there are those who say that the zygote is a new life because it will eventually be an independent life. To me this seems no more convincing than arguing that a chunk of metal is a new car because it will eventually be used in the manufacturing of a car.

Both sides of the argument must equally provide support for their position.I have not scoured this site looking for all of your comments.  I'm only responding to this comment and this ""argument"" as defined by OpposingViews.Right or wrong, good or bad, animals do have rights in the US; however, I have no intention of using that as a reason to support my position, it would not make sense.As for my reasons that a fetus (3+ months in womb) is a person, here are the basics:  Just like an infant, it- has a beating heart- has a brain with detectable brainwaves- has eyes- has arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, toes- has all organs- responds to sound, light, movements, pressure- actually ÒlooksÓ like a humanBy the 4th month of pregnancy, there is no mistaking that what is growing inside the mother is alive and has countless attributes of a person.  It is different than an infant in these respects:- size: a 24 week old in neonatal care is smaller than a 39 week old still in the womb- development: a 24 week old in neonatal care is less developed than a 39 week old still in the womb- environment: a 24 week old in neonatal care may be breathing air with lungs, but probably has a feeding tube (i.e. umbilical cord) but is otherwise identical to a 39 week old still in the womb- dependency: a 24 week old in neonatal care is 100% dependent on a caregiver, just like a 39 week old in the womb, but the care is administered differentlyFor these reasons, I draw the conclusion that as soon as science can detect the organism growing inside a womanÕs body, it is a life.  As soon as science can detect the major attributes of a person (from fingernails to DNA), it must be a person.  To my knowledge, no pregnancy has ever resulted in anything but a person, thus empirical science concludes that all human pregnancies must be of persons.To continue the debate, let's further your position that birth defines life (in this case life = humanity = personhood = legal protection).

I have provided an excerpt for reference: Yet it can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed.This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility. This is the case when a man ""takes little trouble to find out what is true and good, or when conscience is by degrees almost blinded through the habit of committing sin."" In such cases, the person is culpable for the evil he commits.Ignorance of Christ and his Gospel, bad example given by others, enslavement to one's passions, assertion of a mistaken notion of autonomy of conscience, rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching, lack of conversion and of charity: these can be at the source of errors of judgment in moral conduct.

Wade is that it denies personhood to the unborn child.  We can argue this way and that way about when ""life"" begins.  But the truth is, regardless of faith or anything else, it is scientific fact that life begins at conception.  We can have theological debates about how and when a soul enters the body, whether we have a soul at all, etc.  But we know that all human beings begin as a single complete cell when egg and sperm unite to form a new and unique human DNA chain.  We know that this cell is alive.  It takes in nutrients and disposes of biological waste, and it immediately sets about reproducing itself in an attempt to form the human person its genetic instruction tells it to become.  This is the beginning of human life.  It is inarguable, biological fact.The question that remains before us then, is when does it constitute a person that should have protection under the law? IF you broadly interpret the intentions of our nation's founding fahters when they wrote those opening words to the Declaration of Independence, it is the moment of conception.  INdeed the Church's teachings on social justice and life issues hinges on this point: It is our humanity, not our utility or sentience, that should determine rights and protection under hte law.  And if we do not have the right to live and breathe, universal health care is an absurdity, for it cannot be universal.  The alleviation of poverty becomes moot, for those impoverished can simply be disposed of rather than fed at the crack of a gavel on a judicial bench.  The ideals of personal freedom, the right to free speech and the practice of religion become an farce, for there are those who have not been allowed to choose.  Life is the fundamental right from which all other freedoms and our dignity as human persons flows. If we do not take steps to universally guarantee it, then the only freedom we have is pure fantasy.

Now, as a Christian, it is your duty in Matthew 18:15-17 to kindly confront the person about what they have done, with the goal being to bring repentance in that person (James 5:20). You could also look at 2 Timothy 4:2, where it says that you should kindly correct, rebuke, and encourage with good teaching. You see what I am saying? You are not to judge someone, but to rather point out the truth to them so that James 5:20 can occur. To kindly come up to someone and tell them that what they are doing is wrong for the purpose of bringing them closer to Christ is not the same as pronouncing judgment upon someone. We are to judge the sin as murder, and always with the goal of helping the person see that Jesus is a solution for the consequences of sin. Now, if I go up to someone who commits an abortion and yell at them that they are going to hell for being a murderer, what does that solve? It doesn't solve anything. This is the kind of hypocritical judgment Jesus was talking about in Matthew 7. On the other hand, if you kindly go up to the person, show them where they made the mistake, tell them that they can be forgiven of it with the blood of Jesus Christ, and send them on their way, you plant the seed in them in which they can hopefully come to Jesus. Of course, it is up to them to decide, but by showing them the solution to the problem, you have a much greater chance of that person coming to grips with what they have done, and then turning to Jesus and becoming saved."

LetÕs take a trip back to biology class; the male sperm unites with a female gamete to form a single cell called a zygote. So basically when the sperm and egg unite they then create a unique DNA of a human being. Only a small percentage of abortions are done due to rape and medical circumstances. A recent studied showed that women who were raped and had an abortion had a harder time healing than those who chose to have their babies. Since when is it expectable to punish a child for their fatherÕs crimes?Just because you may be adopted does not mean youÕll have a miserable unsuccessful life. Did you know that Faith Hill, Jamie Foxx, and Babe Ruth were adopted? Abortion is done for mere convenience. Many women donÕt know the true facts of abortion until it is to late and often feel depression, guilt, isolation, insomnia or nightmares, and much more after it is done.

You have no right to interfere in another woman's right to privacy.  Banning   abortion   won't stop women from having an abortion it forces them to seek out an expensive and unsafe medical procedure that has a far greater chance of complications and death than having a safe procedure done by a qualified doctor.  I took care of women who aborted themselves and it wasn't pretty.  I found it rather disgusting to have a police officer come to her bedside when they should have been chasing real criminals.  We have nearly a half a million children in foster care and almost half of those need homes.  They may not be cute babies but they are no less deserving.  As I have said so many, many times before, if you don't believe in abortion then don't have one.  Work to make it a better world where few children are in foster care.  Where they can be born wanted, have access to shelter, food, medical care,  education and their mothers/parents can make a living wage so they don't have to worry if an unwanted pregnancy happens.

Why people feel they must force their brand of religious insanity down other women's throats I'll never know.  There will always be cases where a woman's health requires having an abortion.  Her life and health will ALWAYS take precedence over a hunk of cells as far as I'm concerned.  There's no 'there' there when it comes to an embryo but a woman is very much 'here and now'.  Besides tbcass, you still haven't addressed my comments regarding the fact that unless the woman is a member of your family you still have no right to interfere in her privacy.

286	abortion	There is no point in engaging in discussion if the basis of the discussion is in emotion. Emotion may inform our thinking, but ultimately any real discussion must come down to logic. Many aspects of life are emotional. Our emotions exist to aid us, but they are not perfect. A mother mourning for the death of her unborn child is both logical and illogical; logical because she can understand the joy she would have had with the child, illogical because there was no actual conscious being there and the feelings stem from raw emotion. When a woman chooses whether to have an   abortion  , they may feel horrible about it, but know that it is the best decision. Those that regret what they've done because they feel they have done something wrong are free to feel that way, but that should not cause us to restrict the choice of others.	FAVOR

This illustrates the nature of a cycle, there is always something before.""I'm a bit unclear about what that means.  Does 'burning resources' mean using energy?  What do you mean when you say 'reproductive structure'?  Are you talking about puberty or the development of genitals in utero?""This discussion of beginnings simply does not help with the broader question of   abortion  .""I agree to an extent.  The abortion question is about ascribing rights.  What sort of rights do women have over their reproduction?  How extensive can these rights be before we reach the point of absurdity?  (Unless you're [famous and controversial bioeticist] Peter Singer, you'd have to admit that it would be absurd to try to justify an elective abortion once ex utero viability has been attained.)  What sort of rights do humans have prior to birth?  How extensive can these rights be when they conflict with the wishes of the mother?The questions are philosophical, not scientific.  The reason that I think it is significant to establish that science does establish that human life begins at conception is that it shows people that the issue is not one that can be resolved through science.  If you accept that there is a human life involved other than that of the mother, then you accept that you are dealing with how to ascribe rights.  If you reject that there is another human life, then you can reject as absurd the notion that you would be giving rights to a such a thing- they compare it to giving rights to a tumor.  Some (but not all) pro-choicers use this strategy.  ""The ideologues on both sides of the abortion issue want an answer that leads to a legal result. They both want to create the binary situation that I argue against - the worthless/important dichotomy as you aptly describe it.""Hmmm.  Perhaps.  I'm not sure if I agree with that.  Most pro-choicers allow that a certain level of development entails restricting abortion.  Roe has different criteria for the trimesters.  The current law can be interpreted as taking a 'spectrum' approach rather than a binary approach.  The problem is that the law has to be reasonably simple, and so rather than a continuous gradual change, you end up with 'quantum leaps' from one trimester to the next.As a pro-lifer, I am willing to admit that I do have a worthless/important approach as regards gametes versus zygotes.  I don't think that that is philosophically problematic.  I believe that there is a dichotomy of human/non-human and that being pro-life is an outgrowth of that for me.  I do have a spectrum approach if you expand your parameters far enough.  Some non-humans (non-mammals) have (in my view) no rights.  Most mammals have a right to humane treatment.  Some mammals (great apes and some cetaceans) have rights even beyond that.  All humans have a right not to be injured or executed (especially without due process) but nothing more than that.  Only as you mature to you accrue additional rights. As far as value (as opposed to right attribution) is concerned, that would come up in 'life boat' dilemmas.  If only X people can survive and there are X + N people, then how do you decide who lives and who dies?  Relative worth of human life (in my view) is only appropriate to discuss in such situations, but they are rare.  That's also the reason that I have no problem with exceptions for the life of the mother.""In the absence of people trying to make this dichotomy you and I would never have had this discussion. The minor distinctions between being a sperm with the potential to be human and simply being a live human would be an esoteric subject.""I like esoteric subjects.

289	abortion	It's a degradation when it deviates from the purpose for which it was designed. A law should be based on what is right, not personal preference. I would prefer adults control their desires in order that society might function at its best. What if my desire wasn't sexual, let's say I have a strong desire to shoot people who make me mad. Should I act on it? You will say that hurts people and sex doesn't. Really, check out Ted Bundy's story sometime or the thousands of others like it. Consider child pornography, rape etc etc. Or maybe the sexual abuse of women doesn't bother you. Sex outside of it's proper context is always, in every situation, damaging and hurtful to both parties. And if you disagree you are numb to it's effect. However, if you don't have sex you don't get pregnant. And you can't transmit sexually transmitted diseases without sexual contact. It's that simple.About that baby, it's not a part of you. It has it's own unique DNA. It's not yours, so it's not you. It is a unique and separate human being that you happen to be hosting. That is the undisputed consensus.about reducing the numbers of abortions: So if I make a heartbreaking decision after a heavy consideration to start killing all homeless people because they are sad, addicted, get beat up and we as a society can't support them anymore. It's OK because it was a hard decision? Yeah right, try that defense in a court of law. None of those reasons you give come close to proper justification for the taking of human life. A pregnancy is not the kids fault, but it is the parents responsibility. And kids should never get the death penalty because their parents don't want to take responsibility for them. The right thing to do is give them to someone who will.Have you ever had any success with something that you decided from the start that it would never work. Trouble is there are more voices telling kids to have sex than not. Suppose it was the other way around, what do you think would happen to all these problems? Go away? No, but they might return to the levels they were at prior to the sexual revolution. Abstinence only worked well in this country for awhile to curb these problems. And perfection is never a requirement for law. it's meant to reduce the numbers. Slow our stampede into social anarchy if you will.	AGAINST
290	abortion	Let me address the point you are making here:that since the right to privacy from government intrusion is not as of high a priority as the right to life, the government therefore ought to have full access to any medical health records related to pregnant women so they can follow up and make sure abortions are not performed by state licensed doctors?If I'm torturing little babies in my basement are you saying that I have a right to privacy from government intrusion? And if I'm a doctor I have more of a right to do what I want? Don't you think this goes against one of the reasons for licensing doctors, public safety?

If you're going to speak about morality, please clear this up for me:It's immoral for a woman to have an   abortion  , or clear her body of a parasite that she does not want, but it is perfectly moral for you to ignore the impending death of the already viable, innocent life of a child. An actual child. when you have the power to save that child.  It's perfectly moral for you let a child die and not do a single thing to prevent it.  Because you're not morally obligated to save a life if you know that you can.  Did I get that right?  Morality, then, can be turned on and off according to whatever suits the mood.  Life is precious and needs to be protected at all costs - except if it will inconvenience you.  If it's another person's body, by all means...  dictate to her what she can and can not do with her body. Doing nothing is just as immoral as doing something (if you're going to use the reasoning that a woman cannot retain government over her body parts because it saves a life).    If you're going to use the ""it is the process decided by nature."" defense, how do we respond to something like a heart attack.  Is it immoral to save a woman having a heart attack? After all, it's just nature taking its course.  Should we simply watch and hope for the best? Perhaps we should just watch as the newly born baby struggles for breath.  That's nature taking its course.  We have no moral obligations to save lives, only moral obligations against taking lives....  so we should do nothing as the newborn struggles to breathe instead of clearing out the cavities and giving the baby oxygen.     Or does this seem unreasonable?  I'm thinking it sounds unreasonable.  Yet if I your reasoning, this is the conclusion that is reached.  Also, there are ""Good Samaritan"" laws which do, in fact, make it illegal to do nothing if one does, in fact, know that inaction will result in great injury or death.   Not that any judge would stretch this to include not giving blood, or not donating a kidney... but that's precisely the point.  No one can force you to do those things.Again, what that woman decides to do is her decision... regardless of the outcome... because it is her body.  To say otherwise is to deny that she, yourself, or anyone else has the right to govern their bodies.  The fact that you do nothing and the innocent child with leukemia will die because nature took its course means you knowingly let that child die.  Your body parts could have prevented it and you simply chose the other direction.  You knowingly make that choice everyday and no one calls you a murderer.  No one looks at other people standing in line in the grocery store or pumping gas and thinks ""That guy just let that kid die. What a douche!"".  It's simply easier to not think about the things that we do not do (but could be doing) to saves lives.  Why?  Because it's an inconvenience.  Yet  the logic that will morally condemn a woman who has abortion means that everyone is guilty.  There is no difference in those choices.  The choice is yours to make. No one can force you to become a marrow donor because to do so would mean that you are not free to make decisions about your body.   *even if* those decisions can ""save"" lives that might otherwise die.

304	abortion	Mr. O'Brien appears to be attempting to muddle the definition of 'infallible teaching'.  Church teachings are declared in one of three ways:Papal 'ex cathedra' statements  -  Except for the errors stating that the declaration of infallibility itself was proclaimed via this method and the implication that it is the sole source of infallible teaching, Mr. O'Brien's characterization of this particular source of the deposit of faith is correct.  (The dogma of papal infallibility was declared via the Extraordinary Universal Magisterium, specifically from the First Vatican Ecumenical Council - 1870.)Extraordinary Universal Magisterium - Bishops united with the Pope at an Ecumenical Council.  An infallible example here would be the dogma of Christ's Divinity.  (First Nicea Council Ð 325)Ordinary Universal Magisterium Ð Bishops dispersed throughout the world and united with the Pope being in agreement on one judgment or position to be definitively held.  An infallible example here would be the reality of angels and demons as creatures of intellect and will.Mr. O'Brien's assertion of a doctrine of primacy of personal conscience also selectively cites a partial portion of the Church teaching regarding conscience.  Consider also paragraph 1783 of the Catechism which includes:ÒThe education of conscience is indispensable for human beings who are subjected to negative influences and tempted by sin to prefer their own judgment and to reject authoritative teachings.ÓAlthough the Magisterium has a plethora of statements that are definitive authoritative teachings of the Church doctrine regarding the grave sin of abortion, perhaps the most succinct is from Pope John Paul II in Evangelium Vitae who quotes Vatican II documents Lumen Gentium & Gaudium et Spes as well as Pope Paul VI's Humanae Vitae:ÒBy the authority which Christ conferred upon Peter and his successors, in communion with the bishops Ð who on various occasions have condemned abortion and who in the aforementioned consultation, albeit dispersed throughout the world, have shown unanimous agreement concerning this doctrine Ð I declare that direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, always constitutes a grave moral disorder, since it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being.

305	abortion	Since embryology is the scientific study of the development of human life prior to birth, I cannot think of a better scientific source for determining when human life begins.The second part of your comment gets to the heart of the matter, although I think it should be phrased differently.  At conception a new human being has been created.  It is not going to develop into a puppy, or a pony.  It will become, if that development is not terminated, a human baby.What you are really raising is the issue of when should an unborn child be considered a person, in the   legal   sense, who is entitled to   society  's protection.I think it is extremely important to separate the two concepts for the purposes of debating this issue.  Abortion destroys a human life, whether it is performed at four weeks or twenty-four weeks.  That is a scientific fact.Denying the humanity of an unborn child may make people feel better about the 1.2 million abortions performed every year in the US, but it is intellectually dishonest.The question that must be squarely faced is whether a mother should have an absolute power of life or death over her unborn child.  You may believe the mother should have that authority, but denying that a human life is being extinguished is nothing more than an attempt to evade the enormity of what has been done.  	AGAINST
306	abortion	I have backed up my opinion with objective facts and analysis, not tautologisms. Today I restated why birth is the objective, rational, absolute criteria, so I won't repost it here. But the issue of double-murder for pregnant women is important, so I will address that here.Double-murder laws exist because the law-makers are not being rational. Look, is it somehow fundamentally different that a man fatally stabs a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman? Is he any less of a murderer in the latter case? No. Any individual who initiates physical force against another human being thereby forfeits his rights, and in the case of a murderer, the appropriate sentence is death.Now, space constraints of the prison system may not allow for just sentences to be carried out, but that is an argument for more prison space and/or executions, not making arbitrary laws to make sure that some crimes do receive a just sentence.It should be acknowledged that a woman puts tremendous biological, temporal, and mental resources, and she takes significant health risks, in carrying a pregnancy. She does so because she values the future potential of the fetus. Therefore, a pregnant woman who survives such an attack but loses the fetus loses something over and above what a non-pregnant woman loses, all things being equal.

315	abortion	"I think we need to introduce to this conversation a definition of freedom.  Freedom is not the ability to do whatever you want.  That's anarchy.  In a free   society  , everyone has ""inalienable rights"" that are protected by the government.  Sometimes, those inalienable rights are mutually exclusive.  For example, if someone buys something, it his property by right, and it is absolutely wrong to take it away.  At the same time, people have a right to freedom from slavery, and it is absolutely wrong to violate that right.  So if a someone buys another person, we have a problem.  On the one hand, the first has an inalienable right to his (or her) property.  On the other, the second has an equally inalienable right to his/her liberty.  Both cannot be.  It is absolutely wrong to keep slaves, but it is absolutely wrong to confiscate an individuals property.  What to do?  Fortunately, this nation made a decision that the right to liberty trumps the right to property.  As you well know, this was not always the case.  Now, you rightly argue that it is absolutely wrong to force a woman to be imprisoned in her own body for any reason.  I agree with this, but by the same token, it is absolutely wrong to kill her child for any reason.  The   pregnancy   cannot rightfully be terminated, and cannot rightfully be allowed to continue.  Alas, both cannot be.  In this situation, one must consider which has the greater claim to his or her rights.  This is the only situation in which it is acceptable to consider the extent and length of the limitations of freedoms.  I would argue that the fetus, assuming that it is a person, has a greater   right to life   than its mother has to her right to reproductive freedom.I fail to see where you are trying to go with your little ""the government enslaved Americans back in Nam"" rant.  Are you referring to the draft?Also, you seem to suggest I said some things that I did not.  The first is the comment about natural medical procedures near the beginning.  I never said anything about abortion being ""unnatural"" or anything like that.  I support   genetic   engineering, cloning, adult stem cell research, Frankenfoods, etc.  The only reason I am opposed to infant stem cell research is the necessity of killing a fetus to conduct said research.  I really don't give a shit about whether something is ""natural.""  The second is the claim that somewhere in this conversation I said that my life was ""less valuable"" than other Americans.  I never said that, not once, or even implied that.  And where do you get off questioning my support for the   war   based on my enlistment status?  Because I didn't enlist right out of high school I obviously don't believe in the war?  What?

Though motives are involved.Roe literally tries to say a very Protestant Christian British population created a constitution where  then and later legislatures could not vote that the fetus is a human being.Therefore the old ones intended the people of the future could not change their minds about the fetus and that at the creation of the constitution they believe the fetus was not a human being.This ia an absurdity.Such a early religious people never would put in their ultimate collection of rights the denial that a fetus has no soul and is not human until birth.They never had such a intent.They never would of agreed to such two concepts.Roe tries to stop the people from voting up or down   abortion  .Roe says abortion was settled hundreds of years ago.Roe admits there is no final conclusion on the humanity of the fetus.Roe concludes the fetus is not a human being.Roe hints a common opinion that the fetus is a human being could find its place in the constitution apparently nullifying a right to abortion.

In the unbroken chain of descent there are a series of miraculous transformations, one of which is conception. Why do you glorify conception over the others? After conception it is still the genetics of the mother that rule the cell. A fetus's own genetic combination doesn't take over until a short while later, but that is just another of the miracles that occur. How about the eggs first cell division? That is a big one, where the fetus will die if the chromosomes can't dance together. How about gastrulation? An incredible, complex, cellular convolution where the fetus has to prove that it has what it takes. Many fetuses don't make it there. How about implantation - the point where the fetus and mother meet and negotiate terms of gestation. Whatever we decide about the morality of   abortion   has no effect on this fundamental, biological ""choice"" by the womb. How about when the nascent immune system first defines 'self'? How about a heart beat or a meiotic division or a nerve impulse or a breath? Life is a string of miracles, especially during fetal development, and it is not clear to me which one deserves to be held up as the most miraculous.

I also think we agree for the most part, however I took exception with several things you said because I found them to be inconsistent with a Christian World-view. Primarily your statement that Christian morality applies solely to Christians. That is known as moral relativism (for a full discussion of this please see the book by Francis J. Beckwith and Greg Koukl titled: Relativism: Feet Firmly Planted in Mid-Air ) The scripture I quoted was to make the point that morality, according to Jesus, was objective. I was very explicit about that; to infer anything beyond that is to read into what I said something that is not there. I also took and take exception to your insistence that we are commanded not to judge. The only thing I can find is a command not to judge hypocritically and then a command to judge once we have dealt with our own sin. I do agree with your sentiment of judgmentalism and the holier than thou attitude I think your are trying to address. If we are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone then we have nothing in which to boast.

If there is no peril, there is no need of a savior and no need to warn people. And that means that Jesus died in vain. But Jesus made a judgment, people are murderers and hell-bound and it matters not how they got there, only that they need to be saved.

It might be ""live"" in some sense of being active, but it isn't alive.A sperm cannot make another sperm.  (Can eggs ever make other eggs?  I don't know.  I know that they don't usually, but I don't know if some weird mutant eggs do occasionally.)  If a thing isn't the type of thing that can make another of its type, then it is not supposed to be considered a form of life.A sperm cell might be considered to have a form of metabolism- I'm not sure.  I know that sperm are affected by outside chemicals which can cause them to speed up.  I don't know how that works or what the process is called.  An egg doesn't have a metabolism (as far as I know).  Having a metabolism is a necessary condition for life. The cases that we found especially interesting when we discussed this topic were seeds and viruses.  Seeds' dormancy made it hard to decide if they stopped being alive for a time or not.  Frozen cells which can be revived have the same problem.  This can affect the debate over the ethics of embryonic stem cell research.  If their being frozen means that they are not alive (even if they can potentially be brought back to life), then can they be killed?Viruses are interesting too, because they don't grow, they lack a metabolism, and they can't reproduce themselves.  New viruses can only be made if they inject their DNA (or I guess RNA) into a living non-virus.  (Later I learned that prions raise the same issues.

341	abortion	"The ""dialysis"" analogy is invalid; pregnancy is unique One of the most famous arguments against abortion is the ""dialysis analogy"" put forward by Judith Jarvis in 1971. It compares abortion to a situation in which a healthy woman (the mother by analogy) is attached to a dying patient (the fetus by analogy) in order to keep the dying patient alive. The concept is that the dying person does not have a right to the woman's body, and that the woman has a right to ""unplug"" (abort) even if it means the death of the other person. The problem with the analogy is many fold: 1. A woman and a fetus have a special relationship that is incomparable to that between a woman and a stranger or even a relative. There is a special biological drive inside the mother to keep the baby alive and a dependency by the baby on the mother. The mother, therefore, has a special responsibility to keep her child alive and not abort; 2. A woman often gives a form of tacit approval to the existence of a fetus in her womb: the act of engaging in sexual behavior; 3. abortion directly kills the embryo and does not merely ""unplug"" and let it die.

I am familiar with their works.  Not familiar with that argument, though.  I think PvM may be conflating 'science' with 'evidence supporting materialist assumptions'.   The above statement is true with this substitution.--PvM--| That is incorrect as well, in fact in ID speak, | complex means 'lacking scientific explanations', | nothing more, nothing less. From this, ID conflates | the meaning of complexity with what one has | come to understand as complexity in science, | which is not the same as how ID 'defines' it.Again, a citation would be nice.  I don't expect them considering PvM's continued conflation of 'science' with 'evidence supporting materialist assumptions'. ID does say that complexity alone isn't a sign of intelligence, but irreducible complexity is.  The criteria have been revised over the years to clarify, but the core idea is sound: A complex system with inter-dependent parts has a much higher probabilistic hurdle for spontaneous unguided assembly.   A simple analogy is the game ""Mouse Trap"" - if all the parts aren't in the right place, the metal ball won't reach the trigger to drop the plastic net. PvM is also confirming the falsifiability of ID with this statement.  ID proponents do say an empirical demonstration (evidence supporting materialist assumptions) of an unguided process producing such interdependent systems, while retaining over-all reproductive ability, would falsify the design inference.  Human technology, a result of intelligence, is chock full of irreducibly complex systems.  It is therefore not unreasonable to infer intelligence in biological systems absent evidence supporting materialist assumptions.--PvM--| Highlander asserts that ID calculates the probability | that something was designed by chance and then | concludes 'design'. While this description only | superficially matches the design inference, it shows | the gap filling of ""not chance thus design"", nothing | more, nothing less. Of course, ID has not done any | non trivial calculations of probabilities and worse, it | does not have to reject chance alone, which is often | the simplest and still intractable calculation, but it | also has to exclude regularity pathways. And yet, | ask yourself, what calculations exist for the | bacterial flagellum or any non trivial biological system?Dembski wrote a book and has a website and several papers detailing the scope of input points and explaining how and why statistical probabilities are used and calculated.  In real life they are used to distinguish/derive (designed) signals from (random) noise.PvM seems unaware randomness and design are mutually exclusive concepts.  I understand 'chance' as shorthand for that which happens as a result of unguided (random) interaction of matter according to human understanding of forces and material chemistry.  'Organized' means ordered with intent and implies intelligence   Human tech. varies in level of organizational complexity, but is wholly caused by intelligent action upon matter.  This organization (design) is inferred because the arrangement of such matter defies explanation appealing to chance.The calculations on flagellum are irrelevant, but can be derived given accurate input points - how many of each different proteins are needed?  Which components are required for it to function as needed - (ie, if the cell needs to move to survive, what functional parts are needed), how many nucleotides are needed to code the RNA template of each protein?  And so on...  The lack of evidence supporting materialist assumptions complexity is a chance arrangement means the opposite could be true.  That many of these systems look designed and that science has not (even remotely) demonstrated a chance pathway to such organization, leaves design as the logical alternative.

353	creation	"2. Behe claims that normal evolutionary processes cannot, or are very unlikely, to produce irreducibly complex systems that make the cell ""reek of design.""  Behe, while he claims Lenski's work shows that evolution doesn't lead to new complexity and new systems, someone manages to avoid mentioning that that Lenski's E. coli bacteria were able to evolve a new biochemical pathway that could eat citrate, a chemical that E. coli in the wild cannot eat (Blount, Z.D., Borland, C.Z., and Lenski, R.E. 2008. Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A 105:7899-7906.).  Behe was forced to write a laughable response (         ) that dodged the implications (evolution even in a limited lab population can produce a new beneficial system, i.e. an improvement that was not ""degradative""), but, as per his modus operandi, he will dance and redefine his terms rather than admit that his argument against evolution has been falsified.Unfortunately for Behe, Lenski's work is not isolated.  The adaptation of bacteria to eat substrates that are indigestible to the wild-type bacteria -- or even compounds that are toxic -- is an extremely common phenomenon in labs that has been known for decades.  And it is known to occur in the wild.  There are several cases where bacteria in the wild have developed the ability to break down compounds that purely anthropogenic -- that is, chemicals that did not exist in the environment until humans manufactured them.  For this very reason, these chemicals are often good preservatives (for example, wooden telephone polls) and/or highly toxic.  They are often considered pollutants in the soil or water, so a fair bit of work has gone into discovering what happens to them.  Again and again, the pattern seems to be that after a few decades, some bacterium has assembled a novel pathway -- always by assembling and modifying pre-existing enzymes with other original functions.  Well-known examples include nylon, PCP (pentachlorophenol, a preservative of e.g. wood), and 2,4-DNT (dinitrotoluene, a breakdown product of the explosive TNT, or trinitrotoluene, which is often a soil pollutant on military bases).  In at least the cases of PCP and 2,4-DNT, the breakdown pathways have multiple required parts, and therefore ought to be considered irreducibly complex (except that Behe will often dodge here also and invoke a ""strict"" definition of IC which excludes metabolic pathways, a definition which he invokes only when convenient, and which is arbitrary because the IC argument really only relies on the ""multiple required features, too improbable to evolve at once"" logic; in other situations he and his allies have declared various metabolic pathways to be IC when it seems to help the argument).One more alternative might be to say that evolution hasn't produced anything ""new"" in these situations, only re-used old parts.  This too would be the ID advocates sawing off the limb they sitting on; for every ""irreducibly complex"" system the ID guys like to tout as evidence for ID -- the flagellum, the cilium, the immune system, the blood-clotting cascade, etc. -- is basically just a combination of parts known to have other functions in related organisms or systems.  The parts have statistically strong sequence similarity, and sequence similarity is explained by copying, and copying of sequence is the result of gene duplication, which (along with subsequent modification) is the main explanation that evolutionary biologists have invoked for the origin of new genes and ""new information"" for generations.  The ID advocates have almost completely ignored this simple, obvious, well-documented, testable, and well-tested explanation for biological ""information"" and ""complexity"" for nearly 20 years now.  This demonstrates scientific incompetence and carelessness, and lends support to the view (which is undeniable but outside the scope of this post; read the Kitzmiller decision for some of that) that ID is not about good science at all, but really just a branch of conservative religious apologetics."

Natural selection can explain slow change, but how can it explain the Cambrian Explosion?  It is not enough for evolutionary theory to simply admit that this explosion occurred, but evolutionists must explain how random mutation and natural selection can produce this event.  In other words, a theory that revises it's prediction must also revise it's explanation, but the explanation offered by evolutionary theory has not been revised.

397	creation	  science   always wants to separate that messy first cell from   evolution   theory..and it's Abiogenesis... not Ambiogenesis.. - but anyway, yes evolution is separate from the explanation of the creation of the first cell.. but why does it matter?  Science needs to explain all of the above.  It needs to explain a universe which created itself, the first form of life that created itself and also a theory of evolution which operates with no actual mechanism except random mutation and survival.  None of these will work without an intelligence to guide them.Why hasn't evolution been proven wrong you ask?  First off, it's not falsifiable!!!  It's not even a proper scientific theory...because it has no actual means of being proven wrong.  What's even more ridiculous is now science takes anything done in the various subjects like genetics as 'proof of evolution'.... The fact that someone found a chunk of DNA that was an old virus and pieced it back together is NOT PROOF of evolution... it's something we have learned simply by studying the genome.  Of course genetics is related to other subjects like evolution... but it's not evolution.Evolution claims that all the species descended from a common ancestor - and that they did so by mutation and natural selection.  The problem is... if you feel that an animal changed in small steps without any guidance.. not all steps would be beneficial.  The next problem is - the fossil record would NOT look the way that it does if this were the case. Question:  If an animal which has never had 'legs' evolved a new leg... how would it happen? Would it be in small steps or would it just sprout a leg?If you are like most scientists I'd assume your answer is that it wouldn't happen instantly - that the leg would have to form in gradual steps.  So where are the fossils for the many gradual steps of this leg forming.. or for that matter every single change that every single species has gone through?  Wouldn't you have to see at least one fossil with a partially formed leg?... no?... why not?  We agreed that each step would be gradual... so why instead do we see nothing but fully functional   animals   in the fossil record?  Why is it we see nothing of that sort living either?  If you began the forming of a wing.. wouldn't there be tons of conspicuous transitions?You have seen 'The Transformers' right?  In between two stages there would be many odd forms that simply have no logical function... but the fossil record doesn't show that. - So far the fossil record has shown nothing but the vast variety of God's creatures... nothing more.Where are the transitional forms leading up to the   dinosaurs  ?  How about giraffes? Cheetahs? Woodpeckers?How is it that for the first '3 billion' years nothing was on the planet but one celled organisms and algae --- and then once we came to the cambrian period '530 million years ago' suddenly at least 19 phylum appeared (most likely more).. not only phylum.. but many sub-phylum as well.. - including chordates - with not a single transition leading to them.. all appearing in a 5 million year span of time.  Is that evolution?  Nothing but an amoeba.. and then nearly every family of animal and plant appears in the equivalent of 1 minute out of the 24 hours of history?  That's not logical if your only explanation is 'random mutation'... and it definitely destroys any idea of common ancestor unless you mean an amoeba.Look at it and think about it... evolution is a lie.

He refuses to make the second assumption noted above. When the EF implies that certain systems are intelligently designed, Dembski does not think it follows that there is some intelligent designer or other. He says that, ""even though in practice inferring design is the first step in identifying an intelligent agent, taken by itself  design does not require that such an agent be posited. The notion of design that emerges from the design inference must not be confused with intelligent agency"" (TDI, 227). --Source: Ryan Nichols, The Vacuity of Intelligent Design Theory (TDI: The Design Inference, William Dembski)In other words, design does not imply designer, and in fact, as people such as Wesley Elsberry have shown, Intelligent Design cannot even exclude natural selection as a 'designer'.Crowther then continues to confuse the terminology of 'complexity and information' while ignoring that science has  shown  how processes of regularity and chance can in principle explain complexity and information, and thus ID, which lacks its own positive explanations cannot even compare it to scientific explanations.And that my friends, is the rest of the story."

405	creation	"  Rob Crowther Claims: According to the theory of intelligent design, certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection. This is a somewhat meaningless position, as it provides no methods to determine the how and thus cannot make a claim that it is best explained by an intelligent cause. In fact, when looking at how ID defines its approaches, it quickly becomes clear that ID lacks any positive explanation and thus lacks the support for the hypothesis that ID ""best explain[s]"".Furthermore, natural selection is not an undirected process, in fact, it is in many ways not dissimilar from 'intelligent selection', hence Darwin's appeal to breeders in furthering his argument. In both cases, choices are made and the future generation's genetic make-up changes under the processes of heritable variation and selection (whether natural or 'intelligent'). As such, without further explanations, ID has an interesting thesis but provides no way of resolving let alone providing a 'better explanation' to evolutionary theory which contains but is not limited to ""natural selection"".So does ID have a ""better explanation""? Ask yourself, how does ID propose to detect 'design', how does it propose to 'infer a designer' and how does their approach hold up in reality?1. It proposes to detect design through elimination of processes of chance or regularity. Remember that the definition of Design is the ""set theoretic complement of the disjunction chance or regularity"". While chance may need no further explanation, regularity refers to a law like process. What is important to notice is that ID is not clear if it includes 'stochastic processes' since such processes typically contain both a regularity component and a chance component (also known as noise where noise is a concept which includes 'unknown processes').This means that in order to infer 'design' ID needs to eliminate any and all known and unknown processes of chance or (and?) regularity, not a very easy task and in fact, Dembski argues that the design inference is ""useless"" if it includes false positives. Yet, we all know from history that design inferences have been inherently unreliable in cases of the ""supernatural"". So what is going on here? In case of the supernatural, we have no ways to constrain the designer and thus it can explain anything and in the end explains nothing. To understand this, realize that ""a magic pink unicorn created life last thursday"" is under such rules a plausible scenario and yet... So if we cannot constrain the explanation, ID cannot even venture to compete with our ignorance, which is basically the position when all known processes of chance or (and?) regularity have been eliminated. And yet, evolutionary theory, which deals in positive explanations does have a way to render itself as a best explanation because it can in fact compete with ""we don't know"" since it proposes positive hypotheses. ID however is not in the business of providing any explanations. And here we often see a 'bait and switch' approach in which ID argues that since 'intelligent design' can be successfully detected in such historical sciences as criminology and archaeology, it therefor must be the case that it can also be extended to include the ""supernatural"" or ""rarefied"" variant of design. This is however a misleading suggestion since in case of historical sciences, one does not rely on a fully eliminative approach and then conclude, well, we don't know how to explain this, thus design. In fact, in for instance criminology we deal with concepts of means, motives, opportunity, alibis, physical evidence, circumstantial evidence, eye witnesses etc to create a case ""beyond credible doubt"", in other words, a competing hypothesis.

428	creation	Perhaps what is needed is to distinguish between academic freedom and peer review. Many regulations about academic freedom are broad, and like laws and regulations about free speech, can protect someone like a tenured professor from being fired even if researching something that most academics consider nonsense.Academic freedom is one thing. But whether the research being done by someone whose academic freedom is protected is in fact worthwhile or not is a completely separate question. To determine that, it is necessary to look at the evidence, the evaluation of peers and other experts, the fruitfulness of the research program, and other such factors. It is in this area that ID is clearly lacking, as even some of its proponents acknowledge.Proponents of ID can call for academic freedom all they want, but the freedom to explore a topic has no relevance, ultimately, to the question of the merit of one's conclusions. Intelligent Design, it must be recalled, was the prevailing viewpoint for a very long time. So was flood geology. Far from there being a conspiracy to stifle such views, many scientists in the 19th century were extremely reluctant to depart from these established viewpoints. But the consensus changed because of the enormous amounts of evidence pointing to a different set of conclusions being more likely.And this, in a nutshell, is the issue. The proponents of Intelligent Design and of young-earth creationism have this in common: they want to drag science back to the 19th century, as though all the progress and all the evidence amassed in the mean time doesn't matter.

West, and Casey LuskinWe wrote a serious critique of the Kitzmiller ruling. Rather than deal with the substance of our arguments, Peter Irons responds primarily with red herrings, personal attacks, and erroneous statements. With merely 1,000 words to rebut, we highlight merely some of the problems.1. Irons tries to refute intelligent design (ID) by smear and innuendo rather than substantive argument. Pro ID scholars have published more than a decade of scholarship in reputable academic books and journals about the empirical evidence supporting design. Instead of engaging this scholarship, Irons wildly misrepresents a few blog posts and an old fundraising proposal, and uses guilt-by-association to insinuate (falsely) that Discovery Institute (DI) is run by Òbiblical creationist[s]Ó and supports ÒBiblical Reconstructionis[m]Ó and theocracy. Irons devotes pages to caricaturing the backgrounds, beliefs, and political affiliations of ID proponents, rather obviously trying to present ID as part of a nefarious conspiracy of the ÒReligious Right.Ó This is an example of what historian Richard Hofstadter called ÒThe Paranoid Style in American Politics.Ó7 Irons tries to avoid debating the real issues by poisoning the well. 2. Irons misrepresents our critique of Judge Jones. Given his article, it is surprising that Irons accuses us of making ad hominem attacks against Judge Jones.8 Ad hominem arguments attack a person rather than that personÕs position.9 Our article assesses Judge JonesÕs analysis in light of his judicial responsibilities, but IronsÕs rebuttal starts with the alleged motives and personal failings of the authors. IronsÕs claim that we resort to ad hominem attacks is the height of irony.3. Irons misapplies the Lemon test. In a rare attempt to rebut our legal arguments, Irons claims Judge Jones properly determined whether ID is science because otherwise the Dover school boardÕs Òreligious motivations would have been irrelevant.Ó This is wrong: the Supreme Court requires the proffered secular purpose Òbe sincere and not a shamÓ and Ò[i]f the law was enacted for the purpose of endorsing religion, no consideration of [LemonÕs] second or third criteria is necessary.Ó Had Judge Jones found that ID is science, DoverÕs policy would still be unconstitutional if adopted for predominately religious reasons. But Judge Jones found DoverÕs proffered secular purpose was a sham, negating any need to address whether ID is science. As we noted, even anti-ID legal scholar Jay Wexler agrees Judge Jones was mistaken to rule on IDÕs scientific status.4. Rewriting the history of DIÕs involvement with Dover. DI opposed DoverÕs policy at every stage of the process, and IronsÕs contrary suggestions are false. The DIÕs position in Dover was consistent with its publicly stated science education policy, and with its recommendations in Ohio in 2002 and 2004, and in Wisconsin in 2004, where DI also opposed mandates of ID. IronsÕs only source for rewriting history is a statement of a Dover board member whom Judge Jones said Òtestified inconsistently, or lied outright under oathÓ and is therefore Ònot credible.Ó	FAVOR

439	creation	Naming two well known ID proponents does not a citation make to support PvM's twisted version of ID arguments.  I've asked for them repeatedly and he's dodging.  What PvM still fails to understand is that probability is a measure of random outcomes.  It cannot 'prove' design because it isn't a measure of agency.  Probability tells us how often to expect a certain arrangement of a given number of items within the whole set of items.  We expect fellow poker players to get flushes and straights and even straight flushes.  We know a royal flush is possible but not very probable so we might naturally suspect a fix on the deal if several royal flushes were dealt in an evening of cards.  Extend that to a running game over many days and we are less suspicious.  Why?  Because of all possible arrangements of hands, a royal flush is the least probable and very unlikely to be repeated in a limited number of deals.  A deck of cards is cut before dealing as a check on intentional sorting.So we could go through all the permutations of flagellar components, the number and arrangement of proteins, the nucleotides needed to code them and so on, but why?  If we stumbled upon a starter motor in the middle of a remote Amazonian jungle, our experience would immediately eliminate it as a product of environmental selection.  The exact same is true when modern science reveals an IC structure such as the flagellar motor & assembly.  The absence of a plausible natural pathway means the design inference is valid.  The appearance of such a pathway would falsify design.I have not focused on pure chance, either.  Regularity and chance can explain re-arrangement of existing systems, but I would (again) request PvM produce citations to support his central claim that specified information is an emergent property of matter. That I do not address other aspects of the ID argument doesn't mean I've I excluded them.  I'm  just addressing the simple core of ID:  Design eliminates chance as a cause.  Initial biological systems formed by chance collision of the right stuff in the right environment at the right time, growing more and more complex either happened or did not.If the question is whether some arrangement of matter is random or designed, then assuming chance fills the gap beforehand is classic question begging.  PvM's circular proof therefore doesn't stand.  His allusions to facts to which he offers no support, other than the force of his assertion 'regularity and chance can explain information and complexity quite well', stand wholly unsupported.Okay PvM.  Support that last one.  Cite the literature which demonstrates how information and complexity are easily explained by regularity and chance.  That would falsify a central proposition of ID.  Since you said it would be easy, I eagerly await the citation. 	FAVOR

It was E. coli chowing down on the citrate. The researchers found that when they put the bacteria in pure citrate, the microbes could thrive on it as their sole source of carbon.""and countering behe's claims, the evidence actually suggested that this was a change in multiple sites, something Behe has argued cannot happen""This rise and fall and rise suggests that the evolution of citrate-eating was not a one-mutation affair. The first mutation (or mutations) allowed the bacteria to eat citrate, but they were outcompeted by some glucose-eating mutants that still had the upper hand. Only after they mutated further did their citrate-eating become a recipe for success.""In an earlier article in the NY Times, it was reported that these bacteria were not the same ones ""In that time, the bacteria have changed significantly. For one thing, they are bigger Ñ twice as big on average as their common ancestor. They are also far better at reproducing in these flasks, dividing 70 percent faster than their ancestor. These changes have emerged through spontaneous mutations and natural selection, and Dr. Lenski and his colleagues have been able to watch them unfold.""Of course, none of these bacteria evolved into mammals, something hardly expected given the limited timescales involved, however contrary to Behe's claims, these bacteria started to feed on citrate even though such a feat required multiple changes.It seems clear that even these trivial examples of hard scientific work show not only that ID remains scientifically vacuous but also that ID has to reject and ignore contradicting evidence that shows it to be wrong.

457	creation	Yes, when one sees a flower garden or Mount Rushmore for the first time, one assumes the object was created by an intelligent being.  However, this is not at all like looking at a biological mechanism and coming to a similar conclusion.  We are familiar with the capabilities of humans and know, when we see the flower garden or Mount Rushmore, that humans are all over the place in this world and completely capable of creating such things.  So it is not an unreasonable assumption that people made those things: we know they are capable and have created many similar things.However, people do not do such things as design eyes or flagelli.  A much better analogy would be if we saw an object that clearly looked designed (say, a carving of a human face) on another planet, where we know with great certainty that humans could not have created the object.  That some intelligent being created the object is one theory, but how would we go about vetting that theory?  We would look for evidence of that being or others like it.  If none could be found whatsoever, and plausible alternate explanations for how the shape, or similar shapes, can arise naturally are developed, the natural conclusion would be that while there was an *appearance* of design, there is no evidence to support the theory.This is the case for biological mechanisms.  No evidence of a designer has been given beyond that the mechanisms seem to be designed.  And evolution is very well established and explains well a great many biological mechanisms, including many that may look designed at first.  So we have our plausible alternative, and we have no evidence of the designer.  The way in which Intelligent Design shows its religious underpinnings so clearly is in the way it doesn't even attempt to discuss the designer, as if the designer is unknowable and unprovable from the start.

Worse, CSI is not even a reliable detector of 'design' as it cannot preclude natural processes. Worse of course is that even if CSI could be calculated, it would have no relevance as it provides us with no explanations, no mechanisms, nothing. At best, a minor mystery for science to unravel.What is fascinating to me is how Jay continues to quote mine Darwin and misrepresent the science when it comes for instance to intermediates. Worse, he continues a fine tradition of quote mining Gould. And then he claims that Gould somehow changed his position. While rhetorically understandable, I find it hard to understand why such arguments are made since they not only are trivially shown to be wrong or misleading. But lacking science of their own, what other choices are there for ID proponents?Now it can be at least partially excused by observing that Jay is not a biologist and thus he may have failed to appreciate Gould's statements which are not contradictory. According to the DI's website, Richard is--Jay Wesley Richards has a Ph.D.(honors) in philosophy and theology from Princeton Theological Seminary, where he was formerly a Teaching Fellow.--I am sure that his theological backgrounds have found a good home with the center of Intelligent Design, the Discovery Institute. One may ask oneself what theology and philosophy have to contribute to the scientific status of ID. On the other hand, given that ID is scientifically without content, the theological angle may be more promising? Of course, even there ID has countered much opposition from Christians.But perhaps Jay can help us understand how ID explains these observations? Was a God involved in all these species transitionals, although he was less involved in transitions between higher groups? How was such achieved? Why are species still following the expected nested hierarchies? Is the creator restricted in how he can create? Surely such questions seem perhaps more appropriate for a theology PhD to address?

The is so much stuff out there, that actually the chances of life occurring at least once, are probably pretty damn likely. As is the case with the previous answer though, we have no way of knowing the probability of life until we find (or don't find) other life.3) Every individual scenario is unlikely. If I were to roll a billion sided dice, the chances of any one number coming up are wildly improbable, however one number will come up. Does this mean God did it? Maybe, but much more likely it was chance. Compare this to life on earth. Every single individual life is wildly improbable (think about all the sperm cells that could have reached your mom's egg) however, once again when we look at the whole picture we see that life did have to happen, it just happened to take this form.idk, maybe what pisses me off is the harsh reaction to the idea of ID.I think the claims you've heard about the ""harsh reaction"" to ID have been either exaggerated, or flat out fabricated. The fight has been to keep ID out of the classroom, because it was being used merely as a way to undermine evolution. There are in fact Christian scientists who, more than likely believe that God is guiding evolution, however these people still know that ID is not scientific.What you need to understand is that no scientist, atheist, Christian, or otherwise takes the idea of ID seriously. You claim that it makes mathematical sense, then prove it! Show me some equations, that says that evolution needs an ""intelligent agent."" There is none. People used to think that rainbows were proof of an intelligent designer, because it was so unlikely that the light would just form in that way by itself.

475	creation	Hey razza for i wanna say thanks for standing up for what u believe in, Most people want hard evidence that will prove Gods existence, when really we ourselves are evidence that God exists. Anyways i believe in change over time like how things are improved over time, like for say how cars have been improved to work on other things other than fuel. But i disagree with the whole monkey theory, God clearly said in the book of genesis that we were created in his image, We do not have a monkey god, its so sad to see how many people have fallen for this. God is God and he makes everything the way they are supposed to be. What good is faith with the presence of evidence, why do we rely on hard evidence, God says believe and you shall see my kingdom, of course people would come to jesus with evidence in their hands, but thats our main test here on earth, God is looking for those who will believe in him without seeing him, clinging to the promise of going to heaven one day and to conclude i just have to say that we are creation and nothing can change that.

An atheist is stuck with no ID.  If science leans in that direction, (as ID says it does) that is an interpretation they must reject.  The rejection is based on philosophical assumptions, not science.

Even the Discovery Institute is against this.  You know very well that what people want is simply the freedom to look at both sides of the issue. Open debate.  You would think that learning institutions would look on this favorably.  I think we all know the reason.  Their arguments would not stack up against the arguments of the ID side.  Fear is the main reason for trying to shut out ID ideas from even being discussed in the classroom.  And you know very well why ID scientists have a hard time getting their research published in peer journals.  Censorship of ID.  Please, how dumb do you think the public is?  Give us a little more credit!!  It is downright insulting the way the intelligentsia views the public at times.  They want us to bow at their feet and take their opinions as absolute truth.Look what happened to Richard Stenburg when he had the courage to allow an ID piece get published?  Scientists and his peers jumped all over him.  He lost his job and his reputation.  An e-mail smear campaign was purposefully put in place. They wanted to make him suffer to scare others from doing the same thing. So much pressure was put on the magazine that they promised never to publish such a piece again.  And you want ID scientists to publish their articles?  They would if you would allow them to do it.The Dover verdict was a farce.  The Judge simply copied large amounts of material word for word from the material he received from the ACLU.  This was a shameful low blow?  Why - if it is true?!!!  His mind was made up before he even heard the case.  Even the Discovery Institute was against what they were trying to do.  Granted, the Dover school board had religious people on it, but that doesn't mean that their religious views mean that we can dismiss the scientific arguments that may lend support to those views.  If so, let's dismiss all the evidence that lends support to the religious views of the Darwinists as well.What worldview a person holds should not be the issue.  It is the scientific evidence that is important.  If the evidence points to an ""unscientific"" worldview, then maybe, just maybe, the worldview of naturalism could be wrong?  That is a distinct possibility you know.  Scientists take it as a given when it is not a given.  So if it is wrong, there should be evidence, scientific evidence that does not fit with that worldview.  Disallowing a presentation of this evidence because the worldview allows for the existence of ""unscientific"" beings is not rational.  You can't censor out all opposing ideas and then say ""Look, all the evidence points to naturalism!""  Again, we are not as dumb as you think.Besides, if naturalism is the correct worldview, how do we know that we can even trust our own reasoning abilities?  Why would randomness produce laws of logic, information with specified complexity, consciousness, morality, spirituality, etc.  Again I agree that mandating the teaching of ID is wrong, but not because it is religious.  It does not deal with the religious side of the issue.  It simply says that there is scientific evidence for design.  Can't we agree that this is indeed a possibility???!!!"	FAVOR

Life needs no external designer. It has the power to design itself over time. Each of us is the design - conscious or not - of our two parents, or rather, of the egg and sperm that joined to create us. Some chance and some decision-making, some design is involved. Our parents, in turn, are the chance and deliberate design of their parents before them and so on. We purposely select our mates and the environment determines whether our coupling is successful or not. No matter the species, a great amount of examination and decision-making is involved one generation to the next. That is design, however, it is life designing life.Of course, how life first appeared is a separate issue. Nevertheless, knowledge of exactly what happened is not the same as mere supposition. Hard objective science will provide the answers to our questions. Supposition remains mere supposition unless it is followed by indisputable facts. Could the basic blocks for life been externally inserted upon the Earth by intelligent beings? Perhaps, however, before one intends to teach such as knowledge, it must be more than mere imagination. If the evidence substantially supports such a proposition, then, by all means, integrate it into ""what we know"" and relate such knowledge to children so that they too will have your understanding.

These are charges the DI authors have leveled at me in their Rebuttal to my article, in which I documented their ad hominem attacks on Judge Jones for his allegedly ""sloppy"" and ""biased"" Kitzmiller opinion. Although this reply to the Rebuttal is not part of the exchange in the Montana Law Review, it seems fair that readers of those articles might benefit from a brief rejoinder to the Rebuttal, which I will not burden with footnotes. I have numbered the points below simply for convenience.1. The DI authors fault me for not ""engaging th[e] scholarship"" they cite as providing ""empirical evidence supporting [intelligent] design."" My article was not directed at a detailed critique of this alleged scholarship, which lies outside both my fields of expertise and those of the DI authors. I did, however, note in my article the concession of Michael Behe at the Kitzmiller trial that he could not cite any ""pertinent experiments or calculations which provide detailed rigorous accounts of how intelligent design of any biological system occurred."" I thus had no ID scholarship to engage.===It only gets better        The most relevant to this discussion is--Peter Irons--7. Moving to the legal issues in the Kitzmiller opinion, which the DI authors accuse me of slighting in my article, let me comment on their claim that both Judge Jones and I have ""misapplie[d] the Lemon test."" First, they concede that the ""proffered secular purpose"" of the Dover school board's ID policy was a ""sham"" and that Judge Jones properly held it unconstitutional as an endorsement of religion. Second, they argue that this finding ""negat[ed] any need to address whether ID is science."" On this point, the DI authors note that ""even anti-ID legal scholar Jay Wexler [a professor at Boston University Law School] agrees Judge Jones was mistaken to rule on ID's scientific status,"" citing Wexler's recent article in the First Amendment Law Review (Vol. 5, 2006). Without rehashing the discussion of this issue in my article, let me simply note that Professor Wexler and I disagree. Readers of this exchange are encouraged to consult the lengthy, and--in my view--persuasive reply to Wexler by Richard Katskee in that same issue of the First Amendment Law Review.--Richard Katskee, ""Why It Mattered to Dover that Intelligent Design Isn't Science"" First Amendment Law Review, Vol. 5, Winter 2006"	AGAINST
501	creation	I'm hardly the authority for all the great questions in life.. and these debates make me feel as if I'm submitted as being so.. or required to be so.... That doesn't mean I don't have an answer... it just means it might not be correct... I'm flawed like everyone.As I already said.. the Bible is not meant to be a   science   handbook... but it does profess to being correct in every detail.. since it is divinely inspired. Thus it can be useful as the tool to verify God exists.  One aspect of that is the reason there is an 'old' and 'new' testament... the old testament largely consisted of future predictions - such as those in Isaiah - the new testament was verification that these predictions came to pass.  These are discounted by people by claiming they were written after the fact.. though I think the dead sea scrolls show otherwise - and I believe the Bible's teachings were written even earlier than this - and passed in verbal form even further back.Also in many regards you can find on the   internet   long lists of Bible statements which were not common scientific knowledge at the time.. As is with all things.. people attack many of them on many levels... One such statement in the Bible is that the world is described as a circle..this was completely unknown at the time - those who discredit the statement point out that the hebrew word could also be translated as 'circuit' or 'compass'....though obviously that wouldn't make as much sense..'It is He who sits above the circle of the earth,And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers'that one is from Isaiah 40:22... and is old testament.. very ancient stuff. 740-680 b.c. is commonly held. The point being.. just when in history did we learn the earth was circular?  Around 300 years later Aristotle proposed the idea in his book 'on the heavens'.. but it wasn't accepted as a given.one nice example of Biblical 'science'''He [  god  ] hangs the earth on nothing''first off..this is from Job - and as I recall that was old testament stuff as well -definitely B.C. - which I believe is in the dead sea scrolls as well.. at the time people had various beliefs about the earth... whether it be it was on the backs of infinite turtles or the like... and many other views -. but the knowledge that the earth floats in space was not known as a fact.There are other examples.. and of course they can be debated on different levels.. one being the translation.. another being the date written.. and third the exact meaning implied..The point is not that the Bible should be used as a science handbook - it was never intended to be so..that was never it's intended purpose.  The point is that this 'primitive' text is consistent with science - and appears to be ahead of it's time from the things it points out, some of which would ironically be heresy at the time.  There's much more.. but I'm not going to list them all.. descriptions of the process of water evaporation and clouds.. things like that - which may sound unimpressive until you consider what people of the time commonly knew about weather.  Also.. scientists typically wonder why the Bible doesn't contain some more obvious reference.. like say to the DNA double helix.. or something similar.. though this would definitely be convenient -- it goes directly against God's purposes... as I mentioned to you before - it is necessary for God to maintain 'plausible deniability'.. a rough balance... he has to give enough evidence to support belief - yet not so much that it would make faith unnecessary - a mention of something such as DNA would clearly destroy this...

515	creation	"There is no actual absolute proof of evolution as some of the people here have stated. Before people post things, they should really do their research first. And for those reading this I implore you to do your own. Here are three basic reasons for why evolution is only theory and not a proven fact:1.) Evolution has never been witnessed. Dawkin's even states that, ""evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening."" He goes on to say that its like coming upon a murder scene after the murder has already taken place. It seems pretty obvious but there is no concrete evidence. Just obvious clues. ""It might as well be spelled out in words of English."" Well, it might seem obvious, but its not concrete evidence. It seemed pretty obvious that the world was flat once too. 2.) Science is constantly trying to prove the theory of evolution with suggesting that life itself was generated in a pool of amino acids and proteins by complete chance. However, so far all experiments to attempt to manufacture a self replicating DNA based Molecule have failed. If you don't believe me, look it up. Now, there is evidence supporting RNA based molecules. But, even if that turned out to be successful, it would still pose an interesting paradox being that science created the self replicating molecule, it did not create itself as theory of evolution suggests. 3.) The last point is the fossil record is incomplete. We do share similar bone structures with other animals but there is no defined developmental line. Not even slight mutations within each generation to warrant there being evidence of evolution. Though, I will add they are getting closer and closer every year to finding that missing link but closer and closer does not equal found. Now speaking about creation. I have read a lot of the arguments that are saying that creationism is faith based. Well, its just as faith based as evolution is. And there is just as much evidence, if not more, supporting intelligent design as there is supporting evolution. In all fairness there is no absolute proof for intelligent design as well. However, there is more substantial evidence for it. Here is one example:Patterns occur naturally without the need for a 'designer'. For example: snowflakes, tornados, hurricanes, sand dunes, stalactites, rivers, ocean waves etc... These patterns are a natural result of what scientists categorize as chaos. Science, in support of evolution, also uses chaos to describe what was before the ""big bang"". These things are well-understood and there is no debate in the scientific community. Now, take codes. Codes do not occur without a designer (programmer). Some examples of these include stuff like music, blueprints, languages, computer programs, and even codes of DNA. The basic difference is what happens between patterns and codes. Chaos can produce patterns, but it has never been shown to produce codes. Codes store information which is pretty good proof that DNA just might have been designed (programed). DNA is not a molecule with a pattern. It's a code, basically a language, and a storage device for information. All codes that we know of were created by a conscious mind. Therefore, evidence dictates that DNA was designed by a mind of sorts. The language and information of our very own DNA is proof of some sort of intelligent design.I for one believe that elements from both evolution and creation, working in tandem, is more likely that one or the other. But if I had to pick one I would say creation."	FAVOR

If and when the arguments are answered, such as how DNA evolved, the flagellum, etc., then the ID argument becomes weaker and weaker, as it should. The reverse should also be true. Until that time many of itÕs arguments seem to be the most reasonable inference based on the evidence as we understand it today.--But ID does not explain anything, it merely states 'designed' without anything else. In fact, as Dembski has argued, design does not necessarily necessitate an intelligent designer. How can ID's argument become any weaker when it cannot even compete with 'we don't know' which is a far more scientific default position when our ignorance does not allow us to propose anything relevant yet. Furthermore, unlike science, there is no way ID's position could be strengthened as ignorance nor the absence of an evolutionary explanation can be taken as evidence in favor of 'design'.

He simply couldn't fathom why God would take 6 whole days to create the world when He could have done it instantaneously.

Tautological because a Darwinian mechanism can never produce 'design' since design is the set theoretic complement of the disjunction regularity or chance, in other words design can never include scientific explanations or the design disappears. But perhaps Behe means that Darwinian mechanisms cannot explain what ID proponents have come to conclude were designed. That of course is a wrong statement because science not only can explain information and complexity, it can also explain perfectly natural pathways to irreducibly complex systems. In a recent change of heart, Behe has attempted, mostly based on overly simplistic arguments that evolution cannot explain certain specific aspects which he calls the ""edge of evolution"". Examples include a two site binding site. However, once again, Behe presents an overly simplistic strawman of evolution.I find it troubling how ID scientists have to ignore scientific data and findings to support their claims and instead seem to resort to careful cherry picking of data and facts that suit their purposes. An example is the malaria resistance which Behe argues must have happened in two independent steps without the possibility of intermediates when in fact the opposite is the case as papers in this area have documented. Others have similarly shown how Behe's claims are contradicted by the evidence. So far, ID seems to have ignored these evidences. And one still wonders why ID is considered to be scientifically vacuous by so many people, including many Christians. As a Christian and as a scientist I am appalled by the lack of scientific content of ID, but I am even more concerned by its dangerous theology which insists that God should be exposed to scientific disproof. After all, is that not what would happen if science were to show how a flagellum evolved? After all, the flagellum is argued to be 'designed' and since the design inference is 100% reliable lest it would be useless (Dembski), any scientific contributions which strengthen the already strong case of how the flagellum could have evolved, would undermine the concept of design, would it not?Well, not really, after all the concept of design is not about the existence of a designer but about scientific processes being unable to explain a particular system.

Since there is no data concerning the amount of CSI the designer has, then ID is not currently applicable to the designer.  Perhaps the designer must have a designer, and perhaps not.  Science cannot make this determination at this time.Second, whenever scientists hypothesize that A causes B, they will inevitably have to search for the cause of A.  Should this stop them from hypothesizing A as a cause of B?  Science, like   evolution  , occurs one step at a time.  After we test ID, if we find that it leads to successful predictions and never (or hardly ever) leads to failed predictions, then and only then should we worry about the cause of the designer.

586	creation	"Unfortunately Dr. Behe continues his standard modus operandi, which is making bald assertions backed up by incredibly tenditious interpretations of mainstream evolutionary research, and ignoring the counterevidence which has been publicly presented to him again and again.In this essay Behe makes basically two assertions: (1) observed evolution mostly produces ""degradative changes"" and (2) mutation & selection cannot produce irreducibly complex systems.  Addressing them in turn:1. Behe, either here or elsewhere, has provided no objective definition of what evolutionary changes are ""degradative"" and what are ""improvements"".  It's entirely his subjective opinion, which lets him arbitrarily declare anything he feels forced to accept as a natural evolutionary product to be ""degradative"".  But what is degradative?  Probably most evolutionary changes that improve e.g. a protein in one aspect ""degrade"" a protein in some other aspects.  Optimization for specific binding to substrate A will often (not always) decrease binding to substrate B.  But on this standard, a great number of evolutionary changes that Behe surely would consider ""improvements"" would actually be ""degradative.""  Ape feet are prehensile, with thumbs and great dexterity.  They evolved into human feet, which have pretty miserable dexterity and actually aren't even that good as feet compared to, say, virtually any other large running vertebrate (think of cow hooves or ostrich feet).  Bird wings are pretty spiffy at flight, but they're no good at what they used to be (the grasping forelimbs of bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs).  Human brains are certainly great evolutionary innovations, but came at the cost of numerous, pretty much ludicrous compromises from the point of view of a tidy-minded designer focused on a general sense of improvement (i.e., someone like Michael Behe): that huge head has to be jammed through the female pelvis (why?  why not put the birth canal in just any other part of the female body?  You will find the answers in evolution, not intelligent design), resulting in difficult, very painful births compared to other animals, and high rates of mother & infant mortality & injury.  To this we can add literally years of painstaking childcare and teaching (compare to the large animals on the African savanna, who can stand and run within hours of being born) to train up the brain and the underdeveloped infant body, and a major energetic cost.The point is that someone using Behe's loose, arbitrary standards could pretty much argue that any evolutionary change was ""degradative.""  He isn't doing science, he's just name-calling.If we move to Behe's likely defense position, the situation doesn't improve.  Perhaps Behe would argue that ""breaking genes"" or ""decreasing substrate specificity"" are objectively degradative.  Perhaps, but if that's his standard, then his argument is easily disproven, because we have numerous examples of (a) evolution producing new genes with new functions and (b) evolution producing increases in substrate specificity.  Examples are easy to find, Behe likely won't even dispute this point since he knows it is true (unlike most ID advocates, incidentally), but here are references to reviews for those who are interested:Long, M., E.

We know from Genesis that the Sun and Moon and stars represented Jacob, Rachel, and the 12 sons. We know that throughout scripture, trees and beasts are used to describe humans, both clean and unclean, fruitful and unfruitful. Darkness and light were separated, as were the land and seas in that first chapter of Genesis.

But, if you care to know why ""God"" is not included in the growing philosophy of the present and the future, I point you to Rand and Leonard Peikoff for the details.The view that there is nothing in existence that can give meaning to the anti-concept ""supernatural"" comes from several points in Objectivism.The Primacy of Existence places all consciousness in a dependent position on reality, cannot be the creator of it.The full acceptance of existence, as the place where you live and as the concept which names the nature of the place where you live renders invalid the notion that there is any alternative to it.The law of identity makes notions like design, created order, creation, miracles, creation by speech (the Word) all meaningless.  There's literally nothing which gives meaning to those notions, once you grasp that everything has an identity and behaves according to its nature.Reason is the capacity for knowledge and the barrier past which any claims of supernatural revelation cannot pass.  To claim that God told you somethng which reason cannot identify or validate means that you think you somehow received knowledge which your mind is not capable of getting.Reason again is the instrument of proof and insists that, before an honest man will ""believe"" any idea, he will view and understand the proof for that idea.  And, proof means showing how the idea is a logical conclusion drawn from evidence coming from the world in which we live.  In all of world history and among the best thinkers of mankind, no proof of the existence of God or any other supernatural entity has been provided.So, from the simple basis of the nature of reality and the inescapable nature of human knowledge-gaining (cognition), God simply fails to put in an appearance.  There is no evidence to support such a supposed being.Whether you are a (groundless) believer or a person of sincerity, devoted to reality and reason, you need to know where this conclusion about ""God"" comes from.

Believers can go from a God who set the universe in motion (if that) and has done nothing since, to a God who involves himself in our daily lives.--That assumes that sciences leans in that direction and as I have pointed out such a position is ill supported at best. ID may assert but as  a science their contributions remain largely with content.Was it not you who argued that evolutionary science removes a caring God from consideration? So it seems that you have a similar problem. Of course, ID is not rejected based on its theology which is in the minds of many, quite flawed, but rather on the lack of content scientifically speaking. A God who set it all in motion is quite compatible with science as is the position of atheism. Seems that we can find common ground here. Of course, the concept of design as formulated by ID hardly seems suitable to reach such a scientific conclusion, at best this seems to be a theological interpretation. After all, design is not something that seems directly relevant to science.	AGAINST

The human presence on earth is just a blip on the evolutionary time scale.  /> Take for example geological layers and fossils. They are a prime example of the earths age and evolutionary processes that Creationists won't except ( excuse me if I'm wrong here).  />  I have known intelligent people argue for creationism even in the face of all evidence contrary to their views.   /> I do think it would be helpful for religions to be more receptive to scientific theory and other disciplines.

And when pressed for details, the best they can come up with is that their faith guided them in developing scientific theories, theories which had no relevance to ID since it was based on methodological naturalism.It's this regrettable confusion which may give ID more relevance in people's minds than it really deserves. Wanting to 'read the mind of God' can be a useful metaphor to spur scientific research to the same extent as 'wanting to discover a theory of everything' to better understand nature. One should not confuse this with ID having a meaningfull manner to science.In fact, with Newton, one of the few ID explanations he provided, was shown to be quite wrong and it took until Laplace figured it out, to correct Newton's 'foolish' suggestion that since he could not understand how orbits of planets would remain stable, it would require God to actively correct these orbits. The concept of God is one of faith alone, once you have accepted the existence, it is hard to imagine a world without, but similarly, to those who have not found the need or for those who were not grown up in a religious environment, the need for a God or gods seems rather foolish. And neither side really has compelling scientific arguments as to why one position should be better than others.So let's not confuse these issues. ID is already confusing enough.PS: Since you used double quotes to describe Einstein's response, it would be helpful to correctly quote him. It was not ""I refuse to believe GOD would play chance with the Universe"" but rather""I, at any rate, am convinced that He [God] does not throw dice."" (Einstein in a 1929 letter to Max Born). However, Einstein was hardly appealing to a God as guiding his quest for science.--Einstein clarified his religious views in a letter he wrote in response to those who claimed that he worshipped a Judeo-Christian god: ""It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal god and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.

650	creation	"I will address the post by Americans United for Separation of Church and State here and then address the question of constitutionality in another post.Let me begin by saying that this very topic is curious--""Intelligent Design is Unconstitutional.""  As a student of constitutional law, I failed to realize that concepts like those we are discussing here have constitutional merit.  Is gravity constitutional and astrology unconstitutional?  The fact that this title suggests we argue over whether or not intelligent design is constitutional is laughable.For the sake of argument, however, I'll accept that the Americans United for Separation of Church and State probably meant to say that the teaching of intelligent design is unconstitutional.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that the AUSCS would go so far as to say any presentation of or allusion to intelligent design in the science classroom is unconstitutional.  But is this the case?Let's start with the last sentence in the AUSCS's argument--that the Discovery Institute's response to Judge Jones was that he plagiarized his opinion and such a response is a low blow and ""not a scientific argument.""For beginners, that was not the Discovery Institute's argument.  The DI presented a number of objections--both scientific and legal--against Judge Jones' brief.  But the portion of the brief in question was not plagiarized, nor was the accusation leveled by the DI.  They claimed that a majority--a shocking majority--of this portion of the opinion was copied verbatim from the legal brief submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  This is not plagiarism.  In fact, judges do occasionally copy small portions of either the plaintiff or defendant's legal brief.  The complaint was that so much of the brief was copied--some 90+ percent--that it seemed that Judge Jones merely copied the ACLU's report without doing further research on the issue.  THAT is the argument put forth by the DI.Another argument that the AUSCS got wrong is the notion that intelligent design has never appeared in a single peer-reviewed journal.  This notion is blatantly false.  ID has indeed been peer-reviewed and, in fact, many pro-ID scientists have served as referees for other peer-reviewed journals.  But this, like the previous argument, has nothing on the question of constitutionality.But now the real problem with this argument that AUSCS makes.  First, did they seriously just call this argument a ""low blow?""  I disagree, but let's say they're right and this is a low blow.  Does being low suddenly make the argument wrong or false?  Remember, truth claims have nothing to do with how they are presented and neither does constitutionality.Now, I think we see why the AUSCS is wrong here--they call DI's argument ""not scientific.""  Well, while the debate between intelligent design and evolution should be scientific, the question of constitutionality is NOT a scientific one.  Never once in any of my many constitutional law classes, not in any of my law presentations or assignments, not once when I worked in the US Congress, was something ruled unconstitutional or illegal because of a scientific standard.  Let's remember what the question is--is the teaching/presentation of intelligent design in schools constitutional.  This question is not a scientific one--it is a legal one.Another point to remember is that Judge Jones' decision pertains to the case ""Kitzmiller v. Dover"" which was decided in 2005.  The case was not ""Intelligent Design v. US Constitution"" decided for all time.  In fact, on this issue, constitutional law scholars refer to other cases before the Dover trial--Epperson, Edwards, and so forth--and even those cases are not conclusive.  The US Constitution is a changing document--each case brings a new reading and interpretation to it.So is the teaching or discussing of intelligent design in public school science classes constitutional or not?  To find out, read my next post."	FAVOR

Generally there are many supporters existing for the creationism but they are just living life in their own utopia. They should be guided right now. Normally we can find that many of them think this only for what the Bible says. Apart from this, a person who does not know science or evolution of life tends to believe that creationism is true. Sometimes, people think that creationism is science. According to the Bible, earth is flat but no one would believe this. If people trust Bible blindly then why do they not believe each and every theory said by Bible? My suggestion is to forget those things written long years ago without any logical approach.

Furthermore, the research shows a change of I believe 18 nucleotides out of 80 or so, responsible for the regulation.In fact, early papers had already pointed out that much of the morphological differences between chimps and humans are likely due to regulatory gene changes.Now I understand that Luskin, who is a lawyer, may have been confused by how the popular press portrayed the findings but since he works for an organization which claims its goals are to correct errors in reporting, one would have hoped that Luskin would have quoted from the original research rather than from popular press.Prabhakar S and 9 others. 2008.

Yet many, including young students, accept this as fact as it sounds authoritive.   Big mistake.  ID reminds us not to make those assumptions.  Those assumptions are very important.  Those assumptions allow Dawkins to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.  The bottom line is some interpretations of evolution leave little room for a caring God.This is the view that life is the result of  random, purposeless arrangements of molecules shaped by natural selection.  Where does God come in?  Little or no room for God in this interpretation.  Hence if you believe that you can be an atheist.  If it is true you are almost certainly right in your belief.  But, what if that is not true?  And how do we go about determining if itÕs true or not?  ThatÕs where ID comes in.  It tells us from the facts as we understand them today, the most reasonable interpretation of these facts is that this molecular machine was intelligently designed.  You say ID cannot say more than that Ðif that is trueÐ that still is huge.  ItÕs huge because your belief/unbelief in God is a primary world view, and will effect all your perceptions.  ThatÕs what happened here.Example, Crick is an atheist.  He sees molecular machines that look designed.  He says God could not have done this because there is no God.  Therefor, these machines are not designed.   That is not good science.  He rules out design based on his world view, not on science.  He is encouraged to support his hypotheses through good science.  Not through bad theology.  As you say, ID is limited in what it can do, but what it does is of enormous importance.  It is very important to many around the world whether there is a God or not.  Darwinism is often used as scientific proof of no God.  Dawkins is only one of many scientist who do this.  They get upset when their world view is challenged.  I donÕt believe science will ever be able to prove or disprove the existence of a personal, caring God.  But thatÕs the point.  Right now many are using evolution as if it already has proven that God has nothing to do with our existence.  That has not been proven and ID reminds of us of that.  Jim	FAVOR

673	creation	F2XL insists that just because God is absent from the book that it therefor could not have been based on creationism, even though it defined creationism to be in line with its predecessors and later renamed the term to read design. The book defines creation/design in a manner totally consistent with how its predecessors defined it, but in those cases they were more upfront about the religious implications.As I have shown you, you avoid looking at the evidence by arbitrarily setting your requirements for what you would accept. It's the preponderance of evidence that shows the historical change of the book to coincide with the Edwards ruling in which it was found that the use of creationism was not valid as a scientific alternative and a more neutral descriptor was needed. ID matched this, and not the concept since it was just a global find and replace not a rewrite of the arguments. This thus linked ID to creation to its God filled predecessors. Surely you do understand the history behind creationism, which believed that by removing references to God, but still repeating the same old flawed arguments, that it would be constitutionally permissible to teach it in schools. Edwards showed them to be wrong, their response? Not rewriting the arguments but renaming the Creator to be a designer (wink wink) and still the same old misleading arguments.By making information immaterial, it all but admits that it is about the supernatural, by making Pandas to oppose the science of evolution which the FTE considers to be atheistic, Buell clearly admitted that the 'alternative' was what historically was presented as God the Designer.

You usually see something along the lines of ""life is so complicated it must have been designed by a higher power.""  That is not at all how the leading proponents of ID describe the theory.  That is how critics like the NCSE or ACLU describe theory. According to the theory of intelligent design, certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.  This definition can be found at:     www.intelligentdesign.org/whatisid.php    .Scientist who support intelligent design seek evidence of design in nature, and argue that such evidence points to intelligent design, based on our historical knowledge of cause and effect. Intelligent design theorists argue in favor of design theory based on the recognition of things like the rich digital information in DNA and the complex molecular machines found in cells. They do so because invariably we know from experience that complex systems possessing such features always arise from intelligent causes.  For instance, the DNA molecule is embedded with an immense amount of information.  In our uniform and repeated experience, information only comes from minds (read: intelligence).  So why should we attribute the information in DNA to a mindless process like Darwinian evolution?  ID scientists think we should not.  Obviously, ID is an inference from the evidence, not from religious scriptures or practices.So, intelligent design theory is not an argument based on what we donÕt know, but rather an argument from what we do know.Defining what biological evolution is:There are three simple, but very different definitions of biological evolution.  When speaking with people about the issue it is important to ask them which definition of evolution they are using. 1)  Change over time (even billions of years, most leading ID proponents believe the universe is billions of years old)2)  Common ancestry, all forms of life evolved from a single original life form3)  Natural selection acting on random mutation is the primary mechanism by which life forms have evolved.ID scientists do not have a problem with definition #1.  There is some debate over definition #2, but it is not incompatible with ID.  Definition #3, commonly referred to as Darwinian Evolution, is a specific part of evolution that ID challenges and is the heart of DarwinÕs theory.   Be sure you know what people mean when they say Òevolution.ÓIntelligent design is not the same as creationism. Creationism is usually defined by these tenets:¥ The universe, energy and life were created from nothing. ¥ The earth is young, in the range of 6,000 to 10,000 years. ¥ Earth's geology can be explained by catastrophic events, primarily a worldwide flood.¥ Mutations and natural selection cannot bring about the development of all living things from a single organism.

For example, some complex electronic circuits are designed by engineers and others are created through the use of adaptive programs that amount to artificial versions of natural selection. Both kinds of circuits work, but they have distinctly different characteristics. The designed circuits tend to be less tolerant of malfunctions than the evolved circuits and it's much harder to figure out how the undesigned circuits work. In other words, when nature is examined, it appears to be undesigned. This is a positive finding, not a inference.

687	creation	This post by Casey Luskin graphically illustrates why Intelligent Design is not science. Lack of even simple standards of scholarship fatally flaw ID arguments. For example, in attempting to discuss a paper by Pancer et al., (Nature, 2004 Vol. 430: 174-180) that Luskin thinks shows that there was a big gap in the origin of the vertebrate immune system, Lusking claims:  Furthermore, when these authors say that the usage of IG domains is Òuntraceable,Ó they are not asking the question Òfrom what were these materials co-opted during evolution?Ó IG domains are found throughout biology from bacteria to humans and thus it is simple to imagine where higher vertebrates might have co-opted such domains. Rather, this paper is talking about the type of deeper question Behe raises: by what Darwinian pathway did IG domains evolve into the type of IG domain used by antibodies in the adaptive immune system of higher vertebrates?  This completely misrepresents the Pancer paper. It was not in anyway about the evolution of Ig domains, and as such it did not ask questions about Darwinian pathways to Ig, contray to what Luskin implies. The Pancer et al., paper reports the discovery of  the class of molecules that produced allograft rejection in Lampreys. They found it was not an Ig system, as in jawed fish and the rest of us vertebrates, but due to a completely different class of molecule. In Jawless fish, there is no adaptive Ig system. The one throwaway line line that Luskin quotes needs to be seen in the context that the paper was written (discovering the mechanism of adaptive immunity in an organism without rearranging Ig molecules), it is not saying that we have no idea of how Ig molecules evolved. In fact, it says nothing about the evolution of Ig molecules at all.For a paper that actually does look at the evolution of Ig molecules, one need look no further than another paper Pancer et all published in 2004. Note that before this paper was published, it was already known that several Ig-like molecules had been identified in amphioxus and sea squirts that could play the role of the ancestor of Ig. This is not just proteins with the Ig fold, but deeper Ig structure.  In sea squirts there are Ig fold proteins (nectin and Junctional Adehesion Molecules) with an Ig fold and a Constant-Variable domain architecture just like the immunoglobulins. Also in amphioxus there is an Ig protein which is used in innate immunity (the Variable Domain Chitin Binding proteins) that was known in 2004 (in 2006 a protein that is a very similar to the T Cell Receptor and is involved in innate immunity was found in the amphioxus, be here I'm dealing with 2004  knowledge relevant to Behe's testimony).Pancer's paper on the evolution of Ig molecules  Pancer Z, Mayer WE, Klein J, Cooper MD (2004) Prototypic T cell receptor and CD4-like coreceptor are expressed by lymphocytes in the agnathan sea lamprey. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:13273-13278 . Here they report finding a molecule in the lymphocytes of Lampreys that looks very much like the immunogloblulin T Cell Receptor. Not only does it have an Ig fold, and a constant-variable domain structure, it also has a joining, constant and cytoplasmic chain structure  that matches the structure of  modern rearranging T Cell Receptors. It looks just like you would expect a non-rearranging ancestor of  TCR/Ig to look like. SInce then several other memebrs of non-rearranging Ig like molecules have been found in Lamprey lymphocytes. Now, it wouldn't take much to discover this paper on Ig evolution, a simple PubMed search would have found this paper, it is also listed in reviews on the evolution of adaptive immunity from 2004 to 2005. Yet Luskin ignores it completely and discusses, as his key argument against our account of the evolutuon of immunity, a paper which does not look at the evolution of Ig at all.Let me repeat this, Luskin is using a paper that reports that a) Lampreys have an adaptive immune system and b) the Lamprey genome does not adaptive immunoglobulin genes, and then discoverers the mechanisms that produce adaptive immunity (a novel variant of an innate immunity mechanism) to claim that we have no accounts of how Ig molecules could have evolved. He ignores the paper by the same group that reports the very protein that Luskin claims is missing from our account of immune system evolution. If a prominent ID advocate can't even get the description of one basic paper right, how are they going to handle more complicated papers on the evolution of the immune system? 	AGAINST

I believe that there are some things that we were not meant to completely understand, and this happens to be one of them.  Why can't we just be content in knowing that God created our present Universe and world in a series of 1-2-3-4-5-6 and rested on 7.  It doesn't matter if the Creation happened in 6 days or 6 millennia, but I always choose the former.  There are many passages in the Bible that are quite literal, so it could be a fact that the Universe as we know it was indeed created in six days.  Again, this is what I call the hair-splitting approach: Like the disciple Thomas, we demand to justify everything, including the supernatural, unless we can see it ourselves.  If you believe in God as I do, then some things we must accept because of our faith, any presence of doubt will show our absence of faith.

Darwinism is as much a religion for many people as is Christianity.  Just because their worldview doesn't normally include the supernatural, does that mean their science is more valid than others with a supernatural worldview?  It shouldn't.  Basically what I'm saying is that Darwinists also have bias.  They look at everything through their faith in evolution.  Evolution is a given.  What is debatable is how it took place.  But if we don't know how it took place, how do we really know it did take place?  We don't.  They assume their theory to prove their theory.  Much of the evidence they claim supports it, is based on this kind of circular reasoning. The evidence is really a lot less convincing that you seem to think.  The whole rise of ID and continual flourishing of creationism even among respected PhDs, would seem to validate that there is controversy - that it is not yet a closed subject, even though many Darwinists would like to have us believe otherwise.

Therefore, topics that talk about man and woman and man and woman being the exclusive partnership that God blesses (marriage) are crucial. I'm sorry to see that you've not mentioned it(Mark 10:6-9) in your Seven Flawed Arguments. It may be that you cannot explain the matter, or that it doesn't flow with your interpretation of what you feel Scripture is saying.Scripture is clear here, what God has joined let no man separate. Now you may rightfully say that the context in which Jesus elaborates is a context of a discussion of adultery. (see Mark 10:2-4)""2Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, ""Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?""    3""What did Moses command you?"" he replied.      4They said, ""Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."" However, it is within the context of speaking of adultery that we understand what God has put together. God has put together man and woman, this is the pure blessing of God. I quote ""God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. This argument says God will only bless marriages exactly like Adam and Eve, although God never makes that assertion in the Bible. For example, only two chapters after Adam and Eve, we discover a polygamous marriage in Genesis 4:19, on man with two women.""However this assertion is not correct. He makes that assertion in Mark 10:6-9. Also, just because a listing is in the Bible does not authenticate itself because it is listed, nor because it appears to be blessed. What do I mean?God created man and woman to be the perfect union, and when we read about the union with the man and two women, it does not say that God blessed that union. We do know that this happened after sin entered into the world and was not the joining that God entitled for humans (see Mark 10:7). Therefore, just because you have a listed (correctly as it's mentioned in the Bible) a union between man and two women, doesn't mean it's authenticated by the Bible.Your statement about (4) Matthew 19:3-12 is also quite incorrect. Why so?First, Jesus doesn't make an exception for heterosexual marriage. Jesus only replies to his disciples assertion in verse 10 that it is better not to marry. Jesus doesn't say it is better not to marry a woman but instead a man. Actually, there are no contradictions to marriage between a man and a woman, only Jesus' response to his disciples. His response details why it's better not to marry.Second, you are right about three classes of eunuchs, but understand this - that a eunuch is one who has sexual organs removed (castration). And note the three classes, one born without sexual organs v.12, and one made that way by men (or humans) and finally one who has renounced marriage or become a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven(for ministry or the work of the clergy). There is no mention about exceptions for the case of homosexuality here, it appears to be your own interpretation. "	AGAINST
721	gayRights	I do enjoy the discussion's civility, which is why I will keep going at least one more.The representation in college overall is actually more like 55/45 female/male in college, and will be even stronger soon.  That representation does not translate to some hard sciences and engineering, yet, though.  Yes, indeed, science classes are passing males and females equally, but the issue is INTEREST in subjects, not ability.  Men and women can both be amazing at the sciences, Marie Curie comes immediately to mind, but again, the issue is the sex's interest.  Men are wired differently in their heads than females as has been scientifically proven.  The propensity for certain worldviews and abilities is greater in men for some things and greater for women for some things.  I am sure there are still incidences of sexism in the workplace and academics, and that is sad.  It is not the only reason for the massive disparity in the hard sciences though.You do bring up the Victorians a lot, and sadly there was child abuse.  There still is and probably always will be in our flawed world.  We have to remember, though, that ancient Egyptians and even tribes way farther back were virtually the same as we are now in ABILITY, but their knowledge was less.  Evolutionarily, we have not evolved much in abilities relatively because of the tiny scope of time we have had civilization.  Considering that, despite the anecdotes from the Victorian Age, children were the purpose of marriage because they supported the family as the family grew older and supported parents unable to do hard labor anymore on the farms, etc.  Truly today they are a luxury and a focus unseen in human history, but that does not remove the purpose of marriage as a means to produce children throughout history.  There is a reason 4000+ years of humanity has chosen man/woman marriage as the optimum situation, despite its difficulties.Of course there were specific instances you can point out that there were changes, but arguing the exception is the rule is silly.  I realize that for many this is an extremely emotional issue (because the reasoning to give same-sex marriage rights is purely compassionate), so I commend your ability to be so clear.  I appreciate that, because I can't seem to find many that can discuss it clearly.  My only hope is to at least drive home the frame I have chosen to see the issue through so you understand why half of America (or more) opposes same-sex marriage.  Its not for bigoted or hateful reasons (that's the easy way out instead of having these discussions).  Its because they want traditional marriage to be held up as the model for the family because it is the optimal situation to raise a child.

The only true study of such cases would have to use test subjects that were seperated at birth. So far, traits in young   children   have not been shown as a genetic pointer to their future interests.The ""Politically Correct"" can dream-up all the excuses they want.

Don't get me wrong, it has points that many make but there are plenty of studies out there that will put you at ease.First, I would recommend you do a little research on childhood psychology. Second, adolescent children will at some point become curious in sexual activity and it is the parent's responsibility to inform them appropriately. This comes from a parental unit, regardless of sexual orientation. There are good and bad parents out there and not all will inform their children. My point it that parents are parents and some are good at it; others are bad. Finally, if you are trying to insinuate that because someones parents are gay they will become gay themselves is ludicrous. I'm sure you're using the ""monkey see, monkey do"" ideology. Let me ask you this, Heterosexual parents have children that are gay so your ideology is flawed. One last note, on a personal level: What makes you think children will perceive their family as abnormal just on the premise if they're gay? I was proud of my family, my father was overweight and my mother was from Spain (i was made fun of for years on top of having horrible acne in High School). Growing up in a small town almost entirely made up of white republican Catholics, I was abnormal; I knew I was different. Guess what, I'm doing just fine.

747	gayRights	What people like you don't get is that people who are legally married to a member of the same sex usually want to adopt. The child of the couple is going to be hurt mentally because it is healthy for a child to grow up in a household with one mom and one dad. The mom and the dad each contribute something to how the child acts and feels. Without either a mom or a dad the child is mentally hurt because they do not have that influence. I am not saying the child is mentally retarded, but it is much more healthy to have one mom and one dad. I sometimes will say that I support the right to marry but not to adopt.My problem with that statement, though, is that the bible makes references where it says that a marrige is to be strictly between only one man and one woman.

GOD doesn't hate me (the sinner) but HE does hate my sin.  this is truth - its all throughout scripture.when i speak, i am not judging you (or homosexuals) in the way that you are referring to (judge not lest ye be judged).  i do suggest though that you know the scripture before you use it against someone.  what Jesus is talking about is judging people from a hypocritical spirit/mindset - basically being self-righteous.  here's an example:  if i condemned you for sinning and said that you needed to be perfect like me, that would be judging like we're not suppose to.  because i'm not perfect.  but if i called you out on a sin, acknowledging that i too need accountability in my life for sins, than i am not judging.in fact if you are a christian, i have a right to call you out on doing something wrong just like you have a right to call me out (1 corinthians 5:12, proverbs 27:17).if you are not a christian - which i am not saying you are either way, cause i don't know - but if you're not, and you are offended by what i have written, i am sorry for offending you.  its not my intent to argue (nor am i arguing) - though i also will not back down from defending the truth.i have spent many years within this issue.  i feel confident about where i stand and where to draw the line between fact and fiction.  and by the way, i would appreciate you answering my questions, if you wouldn't mind.  thanks."

749	gayRights	"You said Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN.  This is a true statement.  However, Scripture can have a different application then it did back then.  You seem to be very concerned with the cultural context of cult prostitution in ancient Rome.  And you seem to define ""idolatry"" in a very narrow sense.  But Paul does not do this.  Go on to Romans 1:28 when he begins to describe all manner of idolatry (which is simply worshipping anything besides creator God--today this could include worship of another person, worship of self, worship of money, worship of television, etc.):  ""And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.  They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice.  They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness.  They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.  Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them"" (ESV).So, is Paul still only talking about cult prostitutes here?  He seems to be talking about everyone.  I am thinking about the times I have envied, or gossiped, or was disobedient to my parents.  The question I am asking is:  why would Paul have switched so rapidly from talking about a specific group of people to talking about everyone?First and foremost, we must understand what Paul was trying to say with his words.  What was the author intended meaning.  This is primary.  It is strongly related to how the original audience would have understood Paul's letter, but they are not the same thing.  You seem to have given precedence to the cultural context of the passage over and above the context of the passage in the letter itself.  Both are equally important.  I would argue that placing a passage within the context of its surrounding passages, within the context of the letter itself, and within the context of the Bible as a whole is first and foremost in biblical interpretation.  Cultural context is our aide along the way, but if our findings do not fit the context of the surrounding passages, then we need to go back to the drawing board and reassess what Paul was trying to say.What do you think?"

I know a handful of gay people who choose a celibate lifestyle because of their (usually religiously-based) discomfort with their sexual orientation.  That's fine, if it makes them feel more happy and satisfied.  When someone who is gay decides that they must marry a person of the opposite gender, this gets a bit more worrisome, since now another person is involved, and, most particularly, there is a risk that children will be born into a familial situation which has proven for many to be quite unstable.  But still, it is a personal decision between spouses, and children have survived the divorce of their parents for millennia.But when that person begins attempting to convince others, especially those who are already psychologically vulnerable from a childhood of indoctrination in self-hatred, to do something as psychologically damaging as denying their own natural sexual orientation and trying to force themselves to be the opposite, or using emotional coercion to try to compel them into a lifetime of celibacy for which they are not emotionally suited, I have a problem with it.  And when that person forms an organization which demonstrates a devotion to disseminating false information (pseudo-science) about others with a view towards interfering with their basic civil and human rights, and towards trying to sway public opinion to further persecute that group of people, yeah, that really gets my blood boiling.So, if Mr. Chambers wants to marry and have kids, that's his business.

She said, ""Well...., they're soldiers. They are doing what soldiers do."" I said, ""No! they're supposed to make treaties!"" She said, ""That's boring!"" and left. Later that night my grandmother said that it was time to go to bed and that I had to clear the soldiers off the bed.

803	gayRights	 What about a brother and sister Òin love?Ó  The typical objection when confronted with the brother-sister ÒmarriageÓ challenge is that procreation between siblings increases the chance for birth defects in children.  So then, what is the objection to two brothers Òmarrying?Ó Several other reasons that sibling-sibling (and, for that matter, parent-child) marriages are unadvisable are here elided, including perhaps most importantÑthe likelihood of coercion. Indeed, considering that married couples who are known to have a high probability of producing children with very severe congenital conditions are permitted to procreate, it strikes me as being significantly less important than the question of informed consent. The opposition cannot object to a brother-brother ÒmarriageÓ absent an appeal to a moral standard. There seems to be an unstated assumption that those on the side of marriage equality reject the idea that marriage should be subject to moral constraints, but very few actually do. The argument in favour of marriage equality is that the current moral standard which excludes same-sex couples is  inappropriate , not that there should be no moral restrictions whatever. But in objecting to all sibling ÒmarriagesÓ they are unwittingly arguing that marriage:  1) is essentially a procreative institution, 2) benefits the state primarily as a child-protective institution, and 3) may be limited by moral considerations.  These are the very arguments they must reject in order to justify the imposition of same-sex Òmarriage.Ó It is unclear why the first two premises are important to the scenario presented above, and the last premise misrepresents the arguments underlying marriage equality.  See above. Sibling-sibling marriages are legitimately rejected on a basis other than procreation.  Children are not a prerequisite to being recognised as married, nor are same-sex parents unheard of. Additionally, there are other statutory benefits to stabler, happier, more affluent families.  See above. Arguing against one particular, extant restriction does not constitute a challenge to them all; this is as true in the case of marriage equality for same-sex couples as it was for that of marriage equality for interracial couples.   But the opposition refuses to engage in a thoughtful debate on these issues. Perhaps there are some individuals who do not wish to investigate this issue with composure and honesty, but it is unfair to characterise all by the actions of a few.	FAVOR

812	gayRights	"How can two gay individuals celebrate marriage?  The purpose of entering into a marriage contract in the eyes of Christians is for a man and woman to give themselves to one another--freely, totally, faithfully and fruitfully (fruitful being that children may bare forth).  God wanted to make this free, total, faithful and fruitful love so evident, so real to us, that he clearly stamped it into our bodies as male and female--when we come together in the sexual union (intercourse), it is a reminder that we are called to a total self-giving, nuptial love for one another.  This is what marriage is.  Lawyers will never redefine this in the eyes of the faithful (no matter what changes to civil law they might make).  Next, marriage is a sacrament.  A sacrament is defined by newadvent.org as ""an outward sign of inward grace, instituted by Christ for our sanctification.""  The substance of the ""sacrament of marriage"" or the ""sanctity of marriage"" i.e. the word ""marriage"" itself, occurs only in the religious context.  Those ""religions"" out there who recognize homosexual unions and call it ""marriage,"" are in the eyes of their Christian brothers and sisters, illegitimately and falsely interpreting the sacrament of marriage.  And it is not me or other people out there who define what the sacrament of marriage is; man does not have this authority.  It was Christ who defined marriage in holy scripture and it is from His authority that we draw our definition.  There are several scripture passages to site.  In Ephesians 5:22 for example: ""Let women be subject to their husbands, as the Lord: because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the Church.  He is the savior of his body.  Therefore as the Church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.  Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church...""  This passage defines marriage as a call for men and women to come together in marriage, to serve Christ, to serve each other, their family, and the community.What I am saying is that the union of same sexes cannot fulfill the sacramental definition of marriage, and hence the argument misses the mark.  It is ultimately an improper understanding of sacramental marriage.  The effort for ""gay marriage"" is really an effort to seek legitimacy.  Any attempt to do so is invalid in the eyes of Christians (and I am sure other faiths...Islam, Judaism etc) who properly understand the sacrament of marriage.  So it doesn't matter if the lawyer says it's legal.  No matter how much homosexuals want their relationships recognized and validated through the sacrament of marriage, it will never happen.  Yet despite this, we love our homosexual brothers and sisters very much, we simply do not condone their sexual relationships outside of marriage (the same goes for heterosexual sexual relationships outside of marriage).  This is not a form of discrimination, it is a matter of affirming a decision to live the life we are ALL called to live by Christ--one of chastity (a virtue which excludes or moderates the indulgence in the sexual appetite) and purity (not confusing lust for love).  Only in this way will we find true fulfillment in life, as we discover the beauty and purpose of our human dignity--the call to live a life of free, total, faithful and fruitful love.  This selfless love is pure and free of lust.  We do not use an individual merely for our sexual gratification, we come to see a person for who they are!  Marriage between a man and a woman is a reminder, an icon if you will, of this total self giving love.  This is why we fight to keep people out there from deconstructing the definition of this sacred institution.  If you are interested in finding out more about this ""Theology of the Body"" check out Pope John Paul's teachings on the theology of the body, explained by Christopher West (      /).

But of course we know that's not true. We fully accept that genetics control the sexual preference of heterosexuals, and that natural selection, for those who don't deny its existence, is the mechanism for the genetic predominance of heterosexuality. So if we accept that straight people are born straight because of their genes, why do so many refuse to acknowledge that gays can be born gay because of their genes? Let's be consistent.But then the question arises: How would   evolution   tolerate the continued existence of one or more gay genes, since gays seldom reproduce?

Usually, males get mostly the ""prefer females"" genes and females get mostly ""prefer males"" genes, but sometimes, due to chromosome crossovers, perhaps, some individuals get mostly the ""wrong"" genes for their sex. I mean ""wrong"" not in any moral sense, but only in the sense that the individual usually doesn't produce offspring and therefore tends to be a ""dead end"" from the standpoint of natural selection. Nevertheless, the ""prefer male"" and ""prefer female"" genes themselves continue to thrive as essential to reproduction, and ocassional crossovers continue to occur because they have many other evolutionary advantages.So while some gays may object to being considered an evolutionary dead end, it's obvious that they do tend to reproduce less frequently than straights. But all that has no relevance to their rights as human beings and as citizens. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being gay, there is probably no way to change it unless the individual's genetic predisposition is very weak, and why would anyone want to change gays to straights unless there is some compelling need to increase population growth? Since we tend to have an overpopulation problem, gays are probably better for society than straights. We need to abandon the notion that there is something deficient or morally wrong about being gay, or having dark skin, or being ""just"" a female. Get over it."	FAVOR

822	gayRights	"""So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."" ÑGenesis 1:27Our Lord, in His answer to the Pharisees concerning divorce, refers to this passage in Genesis and confirms its special application to marriage. ""Have ye not read,"" He said, Ôthat he which made them at the beginning made them male and female? and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.""' Marriage is derived from the Lord, for male and female. It has its highest and perfect form in Him, for in Him love and wisdom are one.So how can gay marriage hurt any one? This is a very deep, complicated question and answer. (And please know, anyone that believes they are gay out there, I am not judging you. You are not horrible, and it is only my responsibility to share the truth of God's word to those who may stray from it or don't understand it.) It hurts God, don't you see? All sin does. Whenever man decides what is actually right and moral for himself, independent of God's wisdom, he always hurts himself because he has disconnected himself from God's plan for his life. And if he strays from God's plan, the course he takes can affect all of humanityÑlike the domino effect.I take it for certain that the physical satisfaction of homosexual desires is sin. However, this leaves the homosexual person no worse off than any heterosexual person who is, for whatever reason, prevented from marrying, or from participating in sex outside the sanctity of marriage. Or any other sin for that matter.PeopleÑprimarily the homosexual communityÑsay, ""Who are others to say who we should be able to love?"" (or in this case, marry) Let me ask you this: Have we not all loved our our same-sex friends as much as we've loved the opposite sex? I have loved my friends as much, sometimes more than a mate (after all, the opposite sex is oh so confusing at times!) But the difference is we do not desire to have sex with them. AhaÑtherein lies the heart of the controversy over homosexuality, and homosexual ""marriages."" You see the truth is, it's not about ""love""Ñit is about sex, and who these people desire to love, is who they desire to have sex with. I can already hear everyone saying, ""So what?! Of course people want to have sex with whomever they love..."" But no. Sex has been perverted and removed from its original design. First we love, then we marry, then we consummate our marriage (it is just the icing) and the marriage (the love) is preserved through commitment before God. Again, I hear folks saying ""Well that's what homosexuals want to do!"" First, we must understand that love begins with God. So many people misread and misuse Scripture and quote Jesus as saying, in regard to what the highest commandments are, ""... to love thy neighbor as thyself..."" for their arguments. But note that Jesus says, ""commandmentS""Ñplural. Immediately proceeding ""love thy neighbor as thyself"" He says the first and greatest commandment is ""You shall love thy Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind."" [Following is the second greatest commandment] ""Love thy neighbor as thyself."" So if homosexuals reject God's teachings on love and marriage and sex, how then can they use the argument that 'they just want to be able to love whomever they want' ? ÑThey actually want to have sex with whomever they want, otherwise they would just remain the best of friends, you see? That is not the same. And then, they want to take it a step further, and sanctify it in holy marriage. This is re-writing the Bible to suit their own desires which is strictly forbidden. People may love whomever they want. They just can't have sex with whomever they want. Well, actually they CANÑthere is free will. Some say they were born this way. I say that in some cases this is actually true. In many cases it is a choice. But let's say they were born that way. There are alcoholics and depressed persons and naturally promiscuous persons and all kinds of burdens passed on in birthÑthis is what's called ""our cross to bare""... Sometimes we have to make the choice to sacrifice an urge or desire to sin and in turn use this struggle for the good of all. Or we can succumb to it and let the consequences fall where they may. But I'd say 98% of our population has some sort of dilemma to struggle with. Like all other tribulations, it must be offered to God for His guidance on how best to use it.And the American government has made separation of church and state very clear. They must, therefore, be consistent. The government has no right to redefine marriage in its holy context. If they stepped in and redefined marriage, a whole bunch of other decisions they've made concerning separation of church and state (removing the flag from classrooms, the commandments from courthouses, etc.) would then have to be reversed. They can't have it both ways, and they know this. Peace."	AGAINST

This Links the sexual activity to shrine prostitution, not homosexuality as we define it today (a committed, faithful, non-cultic relationship between two men or two women).

Leviticus 20:5 also Links Molech worship to shrine prostitution, twice using the Hebrew word zanah (prostitute) to describe the illicit sexual worship of Molech.The bottom line is this. No matter how you slice it, the context of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 is pagan worship of the fertility goddess and same sex shrine prostitution, not committed, faithful, non-cultic partnerships between same sex couples.

IÕll break it down and explain how I am interpreting and hopefully you will be able to then explain where you are coming from. In any case if we keep at it IÕm sure we can get there.IÕll break up what I said into two bits. There is the bit about you assuming the expertÕs experience is illegitimate. You make the claim that Alan Chambers is simply choosing not to act on his gay impulses and that there is nothing that he can do about being gay just like you could not make yourself attracted to men.Alan Chambers said: ÒI know that thousands of men and women defy Ð and continue to defy Ð any possible genetic or biological links to homosexuality and changed their sexual orientation through the help of caring individuals, counseling and faith-based support groups.ÓCertainly I am looking at it through the lens of my own experience but when he speaks of changing sexual orientation and speaks of his own experiences I take it to mean more than simply choosing not to act on gay impulses although that may have been the first step. By a change of sexual orientation I take it to mean that he has largely or completely lost his gay impulses in that he is either generally or completely no longer attracted to men. If I am correct then you consider his assertion and experience to be illegitimate when you assert that all that is involved is not acting on gay impulses and there is nothing that can be done about being gay and attracted to men. Does that make sense?I might as well add that the reason I chose you to respond to is that for someone in your situation to make the apparent pronouncement I feel disrespected to the extent that my experience overlaps with Alan's. I wouldn't feel that if a gay guy expressed that view.The second bit is the related. I am claiming that you are stating that his change of orientation is just like a decision to be monogamous. That is it is simply a case of not following urges. You used monogamy as an analogy and I inferred that in doing so you meant to communicate that nothing more is involved and that it is just an act of will power not a genuine change of orientation. Hopefully again this is sufficient explanation. Please feel free to let me know how I am misinterpreting.ÓBTW your experiences are yours alone and do not refute the overwhelming evidence that the vast majority of Gay men cannot change their sexual orientation.ÓI believe they give a better insight into the situation than your own experiences. Even if a majority either due to biological, environmental, or ingrained beliefs canÕt change but a minority can why couldnÕt Alan be in that minority?Barbaroni,Thanks for the response.

There are legal rights attached to children and the heterosexual marrying couples such as succession of property etc., Obviously a marriage of gays is meaningless in this context, and serves no purpose and also has no liability on the society at large.

[arsenokoitai]- I Cor 6:9 in Greek, from the Textus Receptus.The problem with saying arsenokoitai means homosexual is that, in ancient times, arsenokoitai was never used with our modern meaning of homosexual.Conservative evangelical New Testament scholar, Dr. Gordon Fee (he's heterosexual) says that arsenokoitai is rarely used in Greek literature,     Òespecially when describing homosexual activity.Ó The quote is from p. 244 of his commentary, The First Epistle To The Corinthians, Eerdmans, 1987, by Dr. Gordon D. Fee.Dr. Fee still believes I Cor 6:9 refers to homosexual activity but he is honest enough to admit that his opinion is nothing more than  ""a best guess.""  I am not willing to be silent when Christians attack gay or lesbian relationships with faulty ""best guesses"" while ignoring actual historical usage of arsenokoitai. When we factor in actual usage of the word, arsenokoitai, honesty compels the conclusion that arsenokoitai does not mean homosexual. Some Christians admit that the word arsenokoitai was never used to mean homosexual. Then they insist that arsenokoites means homosexual anyway, since arseno means man and koite is a euphemism for sex. Their reasoning is that when the two parts are combined into one word, it must mean homosexual.Famous British scholar, Dr. James Barr, (he was heterosexual) 1924-2006, was called by the Times Online obituary, Òprobably the most significant Hebrew and Old Testament scholar in Britain in the twentieth century.Ó  Here is what Dr. Barr said about the etymology of words.    ÒThe main point is that the etymology of a word is not a statement about its meaning but about its history... ...it is quite wrong to suppose that the etymology of a word is necessarily a guide either to its ÔproperÕ meaning in a later period or to its actual meaning in that period.Ó    James Barr, The Semantics of Biblical Language, Oxford University Press, New York, 1961, p. 109.The way arsenokoites was actually used in the ancient Greek language must be our guide as to its meaning.

When babies were born, they are weak and they are dependant on their mothers or those whom they think is his/her parents that he/she could relate to. Kids learn from their parents because it's the parents responsiblity to teach their children what is right and what is wrong and not someone elses.Unless you're trying to prove to me that the parent's role isn't to teach the children what is nature and what is not according to nature etc. you cannot have sex with a man like you did with a woman.It's impossible unless that man was a woman before a sex change operation and was reluctant to change her organs.What 'most' debate i saw about how homosexuality is morally accepted by people utterly shocked me to the core. I'm not sure what kind of world are you in but i certainly do not accept it as 'normal'because it is abnormal and going against nature.Firstly, the environment i grew up in doesn't have too much catholics and christians but mostly made up of other religions.

He was determined to convert me from a buddhist to a christian but once i heard it i brushed him aside.'If you don't believe in Jesus christ, you shall go to hell'.This is a total piece of bullshit, who in the world needs to go to hell when he is accumulating merits here and there is no such thing as absolute creator god who creates the whole universe in seven days.And god don't love us too.If he has the powers of a clairvoyant and loves us, if he saw the future of man he would'nt have created us in the first place. He would'nt have created Adam and Eve in the first place.And if he truly is an absolute god he would'nt have creatd lucifer whom he knew that one day lucifier is going to turn bad and become satan.Christianity is bulljunk and i totally hate it.Although i hate christianity i don't really hate christians.I only dislike those who is obessed with it.

Many of our Founding Fathers were opposed and relunctantly accepted its inclusion to keep the framework going. As abhorrent as slavery is, the Supreme Court upheld its constitutional duty in the Dred Scot decision -- the court interpreted the law at that time. It did not make new law, an unconstitutional action that the Burger Court assumed. When American   society   finally realized the evils of slavery, the Constitution was amended, as outlined by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution.Homosexualty being a choice is not irrelevant to this discussion. It actually goes to the heart of the matter. Civil rights were denied to African-Americans simply because of their skin color, something they could not change. Homosexuals are commandeering the African-American struggle for   civil rights   as their cause. Homosexuals are claiming that they're born   homosexual  , and thus cannot change. That's the red herring in this debate.My experience is no more valuable than anyone else's, but I use it to back up my side of the debate. Personal appeals enact more laws that you're giving credit for. That's why we have such laws as ""Meghan's Law"" and the current mortgage   bailout  .

892	gayRights	"OK maybe I'm naive but I always thought that very complex things had designers. Complexity is a sign of intelligence I thought. I also thought that when you designed something you had a purpose and function in mind. For example when GM designs a car they design it to be driven on roads, not across lakes. And I thought the designer determined the purpose and function, not the thing made. Now you could attempt to drive your car across the lake because you think it's a boat. But the results will quickly tell you that it was not designed for that purpose.Now maybe I'm being very naive again but I think that human beings are very complex things, vastly more complex than we know. So it would seem to me from an engineering perspective that just to design and make a human function would require an intelligence that is beyond anything we can conceive. Just think for a minute what you would have to know about chemistry. Not to mention that you would then have to take this concept and write it in a genetic code. And if that's not incredible enough. Just think what it takes to make it beautiful.All this to say that it's plain we have a creator, someone who designed us. Someone who had a purpose and function in mind when we were designed. It is then this designer who determines our purpose and function, not us. So therefore if we have a purpose and function for which we were designed I think we should be able to tell from the results whether or not we are using our bodies for the purpose for which they were designed. For example, my cell phone has a purpose for which it was designed; To make and take calls. Now what happens when I think it will also make a great hammer? I quickly find out that it wasn't designed for that purpose.So. Is homosexuality morally wrong? Well check the results. Married men live longer, healthier, happier and productive lives. Homosexual men live half as long, have high rates of drug use, infectious disease and suicide. But don't take my word for it. Check the results yourself so you'll know I'm not just making this up.Final thought for all those who will object that it is not plain we were designed.

He sees it and recognizes it but because of the implications he has to say that it ""gives the appearance of having been designed for a purpose"" The Blind Watchmaker Maybe I'm an idiot but that sure sounds like a denial of the obvious.

Instead, what we see is that none of them identified the sin of Sodom as homosexuality until around the first century. Here is what ancient Jews believed about the sin of Sodom.      Biblical authors identify the sin of Sodom as idolatry [shrine prostitution, for example]  or adultery or pride or prosperity and greed or refusal to help the poor and needy [lack of hospitality] - Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel. Writers outside the inspired scriptures identified the sin of Sodom as pride and refusal to be kind to strangers traveling through their land.      six11 wrote:>>>>>""jude 1:7 connects sodom with 'sexual immorality' - which includes homosexual relationships""<<<<<That statement is inaccurate. Jude used the Greek word, heteros, to identify the kind of sin that was being committed in Sodom. Had Jude intended us to believe the sin of Sodom was related to same sex activity, he would have used the Greek word, homoios, which is the root of our English word, homosexual.six11 wrote:>>>>>""knowing that several other towns/cities were rude and had horrible towards GOD'S messengers, why didn't GOD also destroy those places as well?""<<<<<History testifies that God is full of grace toward humanity, even in the midst of sin.      six11 wrote:>>>>>""joe dallas notes in his book a strong delusion, ""the prohibitions against homosexuality in Leviticus appear alongside other sexual sins ... which are forbidden in both [testaments] ...

They would still receive the same benefits of a civil union (previously known by the government as a ""marriage"") but the ""sanctity of marriage"" is maintained for groups who do not approve of same sex couples. Marriage is a word whose connotation and definition differ from individual to individual. The use of the word by government is provocation for misunderstanding and schism.

I don't think ancient man was as concerned with the proper ""environment"" to raise children so much as they were concerned about being able to lay claim to a son/daughter. Sperm/Egg banks and adoption agencies are all private entities. They aren't forced into anything and they already cater to gay/lesbian couples. Some of these couples even manage to have heterosexual relationships long enough to produce children of their own. Allowing gay/lesbians to marry won't change the fact that they are already capable of having children one way or another. I am a fan of a two-parent household. I especially like for the parents to be married. I, like you, think it's ideal. I understand your concern for children needing a father and a mother, because I completely agree. But I also think that children deserve, more than anything, a loving environment where they can prosper and be safe. If that comes in a gay/lesbian household so be it.What exactly do you mean by ""elevating same sex marriages denies the differences between men and women""? How so? It's a fact that men and women are different. I have no problem with that thought. In a same sex relationship, there isn't one partner ""playing"" the opposite sex.

Not all things biological are related to one's genetic code. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, for example, has real, physical affects that aren't related to the genes of the person carrying it. The evidence studied indicates several factors that tie sexual orientation with biological characteristics. Birth order, for one--Women who give birth multiple times have lower levels of certain hormones in their womb by baby number 3 or 4. That's why, and this has been studied and confirmed, the more older siblings you have when you're born, the more likely it is that you'll end up a homosexual--at least, for men.      is a good list of all the studies that have been done regarding the biological factors in sexual orientation.As for it being a choice--certainly, we choose what we do with our genitals in most circumstances. However, we don't really get to choose what sets us off--what sort of person gets our motor running. Historically of course,   homosexuality   was a very, very different thing than it is today. But trust me when I say that it's been around forever--not just since celebrity culture has come about, it's seen in most   animals   studied--not just humans, and for most of human history it's been a societal norm--not an act of deviance, but something most everyone did at one point or another.

Not so much in the sense that it is 'wicked', 'evil' or 'vile', but in the sense that it 'deviates' from the norm.Approximately 3% of the population are homosexual. That means 97% aren't. Therefore, homosexuality 'Deviates' greatly from the norm. Society (The People) at large also have Rights and the Constitutional ability to voice their Rights .

To declare this as a reason why same-gender parents are inadequate to parent children is simply ridiculous.  It's equivalent to claiming that a black child cannot be adequately parented by white parents because they will not be able to give the child guidance with regard to his/her race.

So I guess I would have to prove that sex before marriage is a sin first (because it was talking about men and women lying with the same gender). Then I would have to go into detail about how God created man and woman to procreate, not man and man or woman and woman. Finally I would have to show you that a ""Godly"" relationship includes a male and female (not 2 of same gender). This is all evdent from scripture, yet you ignore those points. You told me that Lev. 18:22 is not about those committed relationships between male and male...correct? Yet this is what it states: ""Lev. 18:22: ""You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination."" It states that ANYONE that lies with a male as one lies with a female is an abomination. Lets define abomination: loathsome, hateful, wicked, or vile, forbidden, and unclean.It is telling everyone that no one should lie with the same gender, because it is unclean, forbidden, vile, wicked, etc. So you can't take out those who participate in this act because they are more ""committed"" than others. Christians practicing sex before marriage can not say, ""We are committed, so it must not be sinning."" It is sin no matter how committed we are. Same goes for God's view on homosexuality.1 Corinthians 6:9 - the word you gave me, Arsenokoitai, translates in the Greek as a ""sodomite: one who practices sodomy."" ""Sodomy is a term used today predominantly in law (derived from traditional Christian usage) to describe the act of anal intercourse, oral intercourse, as well as bestiality. When used in a religious context, it has a negative connotation (wikipedia).""In many translations, the word is translated as ""effeminate"" which according to Merriam-Webster, its defined as: ""having feminine qualities untypical of a man : not manly in appearance or manner.""That would mean that any man who ""has feminine qualities untypical of a man, and that does not act in a manly manner nor look like one in appearance, shall not inherit the kingdom of God. The reason it is translated as ""homosexual"" is because the word ""effeminate"" describes a homosexual man. It also says those who practice this lifestyle of sodomy, which is exactly what homosexuals do, correct? **You need to either rebuttal me with your own words and beliefs, not 20 web pages that I am not going to read.

936	gayRights	I believe the question is should gays have the right to MARRY, not do i think gays should have the same legal and moral rights and obligations as married heterosexuals. Gays, when choosing to live together can sign contracts protecting their rights, very similar to vows, and can hold their partner accountable if they dont abide by the contact, protecting themselves financially and morally and creating obligations. This is usually legally stronger than marriage vows as contracts are often added to marriages to clarify the terms. I agree that a person doesn't Choose who they fall in love with, but they do choose to act on it. There are alot of gay people out there who have chosen to be in heterosexual relationships for reasons of their own, just as someone else has chosen to go with their desires and follow the path they feel is right for them. Living in a gay relationship is definitely a choice. If a person buys his house knowing he is beside the airport, should he be listened to when he complains about the noise.

944	gayRights	"Contrary to many beliefs that homosexuality is not a sin, I would have to disagree. Homosexuality is much like any sin: lying, stealing, coveting, idolatry, etc. I realize it is a controversial topic in today's society, but it doesn't mean we can ignore the word of God. One thing I do disagree with is: the way homosexuals are treated by Christians and the church. We are all sinners, like Romans 3:23 says: ""for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" We must understand that homosexuality is a sin, like 1 Corinthians 6:9 says: ""Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality.""The one thing Christians do tend to do is to judge harshly, the homosexuals. I do not believe this should happen. Homosexuality is just one of many sins, and we all sin daily, no matter who we are. Those of us who recognize this and have asked Jesus for forgiveness will be forgiven, but those who dwell and live in sin will not inherit the kingdom of God. I do know many Christians that struggle with homosexuality, but we should encourage them to listen to God's voice. I do believe many homosexuals will and have gone to heaven, those who truly have a relationship with God and try to obey his commandments. On a tighter note, I do stand at the point: homosexuality is still a sin. "	AGAINST
945	gayRights	"Peace Sid,You have changed your argument, I see, or perhaps more precisely clarified it from the apparent fallacies I lying there in.  Now that we are on the same page we can move forward.  I want you to know before I continue that I have no desire to belittle you or make you feel inferior because of your lack of faith, or the faith that you do have in rationalism.  Sometimes I find these forums and online means of communication tiresome.  I don't really know you, and you don't really know me.  This isn't the most conducive to honest communication and dialogue.  My overarching aim is to wish you the best in all that life has for you.  When I write peace I do not write it as a mere triviality but as sincere request for peace to come upon you and your life.  With this I shall continue. As arguments do often rest on premises so does yours.  Your premise is ""Rational truth is objective and spiritual truth is subjective.""  I beg to differ.  Rational truth can be objective and it can be subjective it is not more bound in objectivity or subjectivity than spiritual truth or faith faith, for that matter.  Rational truth can be objective as you argue, when it bases itself self out of conclusions drawn from the real including that which is material is this world and in the whole universe.  Even here though, there is a principle assumption that is ""believed,"" that is faith is necessary for reason to be valid objectively because we must assume, or believe with faith, that the human senses are actually and able to perceive the real and that the human mind is able to make sense out what is perceived in a manner that is true.  This basic premise must be believed for rational thought to have any air of possible objectivity.  Rational thought, is therefore, always dependent on a certain amount of faith.  If faith is as you say, belief without evidence then it is a belief in something independent of any concept of the real, it is subjective and all rational truth is therefore subjective.  This is a primary problem in metaphysics.  The first philosophers to shed off the tradition Aristotelian scholasticism found it necessary to validate reality in faith.  Descartes, for instance doubted that our perception of anything is guaranteed except that which is guaranteed by God.  Later philosophers who ""dumped"" the idea that the real can be perceived because God guarantees it also dumped any notion of objective reality.  Objective reality forever became something beyond human grasp nor could any such validation be made of whether there even was an objective reality.  David Hume advanced this concept when he argued that humans merely receive impressions from the outside and makes sense of them internally through laws of association.  This assemblage and putting together of external impressions is an entirely subjective feat.  Immanuel Kant further advanced this when he said that our only understanding of reality is through our experiences.  These experiences he called phenomenon and so humans a a phenomenological attempt at truth but had no access to what he called noumenal reality or what we know as objective reality.  He said that it is the mind that shapes reality and not reality the mind since we put our thoughts together through our categories of understanding.  Other philosophers and anthropologists have even yet further argued that these categories of understanding are primarily determined by our language, such as is argued in the sapir-whorf hypothesis.  The point of my detour through some history of modern philosophy is to show that without God and without faith there is not real.  If any of these Godless, worldviews are adopted then there is no objective reality metaphysically for there to be an objective truth let alone an objective truth that happens to be rational.  Therefore, in either case, whether we can reach an objective reality guaranteed by God or cannot rational and reason is subjective or dependent on faith.  Before I move on I would like to define more precisely what subjective and objective actually mean:""Objective: Having actual existence or reality.""""Subjective: Proceeding from or taking place in a person's mind rather than the external world""Both from The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 4th edition"	AGAINST

Oh, wait, yes he did, too. Remember the story about the Centurian? No?The one recorded instance in the entire Bible where Jesus ever encountered a gay person was the Centurian story. A Roman soldier - the Centurian - calls Jesus in a crowd and asks him to heal his ill slave - specifically referring to him as his male, sex slave, his lover. (Check the original language.) Jesus' response isn't one of revulsion, but utter praise! When the Centurian says that it is not necessary for Jesus to travel to the lover to heal him, that the lover was healed simply because Jesus said he was healed, caused Jesus to exclaim to the crowd, ""I have not seen this kind of faith in all of Israel!"" Yes, praise for a homosexual's faith, not condemnation of who he was. Explain that.Are you telling me you are more holly than Jesus himself? If He did not judge us, why do you?And speaking of which, how come you never condemn wealth? Jesus certainly did. A third of all the words in the New Testament, and 2/3 of the words of Jesus, specifically say that the wealthy have great problems getting into heaven because their wealth keeps them from God. Yet you never, ever hear evangelicals mention that? Why? Too busy raising money and driving Mercedes?Why this fascination with homosexuality when Christ tells you take care of the poor, care for the widowed and defenseless, and stop judging?

If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child. Hence the term ""give him/her up for adoption"". You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.""My response:Your argument is an excellent example of the fallacy, self-refutation. The argument affirms in one statement that which it denies in another. You argument asserts that a progenitor gives up its authority to the child when the progenitor gives up the child for adoption. It therefore must be also true when state agencies give up children for adoption they too have no authority. Explain why the argument expresses the denial of authority for the progenitor in the case of adoption while consequently implying the affirmation of authority of state agencies that too seek adoption for a child. Whether your argument is willful deception or a logical error remains for you to decide.Next, reread the conclusion and you will find: Õ É..the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relativesÕÉ... The child remains under the authority of the parent until the child is adopted. You attempted to redefine that which was previously defined in the argument, and your argument is attempting to establish the straw-man fallacy.Again, you stated: 'You must also note that the acceptance by society makes it an institution.'Therefore in accord with that proposition the following is valid:Society accepts homosexuality. Therefore, homosexuality is an institution.Society accepts masturbation. Therefore, masturbation is an institution.Society accepts stupidity. Therefore, stupidity is an institution.Society accepts whatever. Therefore, whatever is an institution.Reductio ad absurdum!Again, you stated:'If you are not willing to or cannot take responsibility for maintaining a child and ""give"" it up for adoption, you lose all rights to that child. 'What do you mean by maintaining a child? Your arguments are validating my arguments.Parents maintain their cars, houses, lawns, toilets, tubs, sex toys, etc., but never can it be said that they maintain their children, unless of course they are alike janitors and maintenance personnel. Parents, through out the life of either themselves or their children, always strive to care for their progeny in whatever capacity is required at any given time and provide both tangible and abstract necessities. You assert: ÒI must lastly note that most of your first paragraph has no psychological validity in the nature of homosexuality.ÓYour final statement doesnÕt challenge any assertion in paragraph one. Moreover, paragraph one of the argument is not a psychological description of any subject and hence cannot be psychologically valid or invalid. It is however an argument that is demonstratively evidenced by the deeds of homosexuals. No attempt was made in my argument to suggest a description of the mind or the thought processes of male or female homosexuals.And lastly, if homosexuals are that caring why would they adopt a baby that they cannot breast feed? For breastmilk is the best milk for infants. All companies that produce baby formula admit that their products are second best. The natural order of life among animals is predicated upon the breast milk of the mother. And just because female homosexuals can be made pregnant by methods contrary to nature doesnÕt mean they should be a mother; for by reason of their nature they will not naturally become mothers."

968	gayRights	According to Love IsnÕt Enough: 5 Reasons Why Same-Sex Marriage Will Harm Children By Trayce Hansen, Ph.D.Hansen sites these five reasons in her article. 1.First, mother-love and father-loveÑthough equally importantÑare qualitatively different and produce distinct parent-child attachments. Specifically, itÕs the combination of the unconditional-leaning love of a mother and the conditional-leaning love of a father thatÕs essential to a childÕs development. Either of these forms of love without the other can be problematic. Because what a child needs is the complementary balance the two types of parental love and attachment provide.2. Only heterosexual parents offer   children   the opportunity to develop relationships with a parent of the same, as well as the opposite sex. Relationships with both sexes early in life make it easier for a child to relate to both sexes later in life. For a girl, that means sheÕll better understand and appropriately interact with the world of men and be more comfortable in the world of women. And for a boy, the converse will hold true. Having a relationship with Òthe otherÓÑan opposite sexed parentÑalso increases the likelihood that a child will be more empathetic and less narcissistic.Overall, fathers play a restraining role in the lives of their children. They restrain sons from acting out antisocially, and daughters from acting out sexually. When thereÕs no father to perform this function, dire consequences often result both for the fatherless children and for the   society   in which these children act out their losses.3.Third, boys and girls need an opposite-sexed parent to help them moderate their own gender-linked inclinations. As example, boys generally embrace reason over emotion, rules over relationships, risk-taking over caution, and standards over compassion, while girls generally embrace the reverse. An opposite-sexed parent helps a child keep his or her own natural proclivities in check by teachingÑverbally and nonverballyÑthe worth of the opposing tendencies. That teaching not only facilitates moderation, but it also expands the childÕs worldÑhelping the child see beyond his or her own limited vantage point.4.Fourth,   same-sex marriage   will increase sexual confusion and sexual experimentation by young people. The implicit and explicit message of same-sex marriage is that all choices are equally acceptable and desirable.5. The emotional and psychological ramifications of these assorted arrangements on the developing psyches and sexuality of children would be disastrous. And what happens to the children of these alternative marriages if the union dissolves and each parent then ÒremarriesÓ? Those children could end up with four fathers, or two fathers and four mothers, or, you fill in the blank.Certainly homosexual couples can be just as loving as heterosexual couples, but children require more than love. They need the distinctive qualities and the complementary natures of a male and female parent. end of articleI think Hansen does a fine job in conveying the dangers of homosexual   parenting  .

974	gayRights	"About complementarianisim:Although there seems to be a simillarity between the Platonic account of origins and the account given in Scripture but when actually read in the context of the ""Symposium"" it is quickly realized that simillarities actually fall because the story is so grossly different from the acount given in Genesis.  The accuasation that ""anti-gay"" thearpists are basing their ""complementarity"" views of of Plato and not Scripture is not substantiated.  Those who affirm that homosexuality is sin would find Plato's story in disfavor because it seems to support homosexuality as a natural inclination of some humans.  Those who disfavor a text because of its anthetical argument would not use that text to base their thesis unless they were attacking it.  Therefore the therapits written about in this article are not basing their views off of Plato's ""Symposium"" but off of some other source, a source that would not affirm homosexuality is natural or permittable.  Plato himself, however, reveals his own opinion about homosexuality later in life.  He accounts that it is both against nature and originated when men, because of their lack of self-control, induldged in their passions.  I have found this to be true in the experiances of some homosexualities and especially more common in bisexual men.  Only one section of the ""clobber"" passages are used to connect homosexuality to Sodom and Gomorah so your argument that they are not linked, even if true, does not account the vast majority of Scriptures that deal with homosexuality.  Although traditinoally the story of Sodom and Gomorah has been attributed to the sin of homosexuality I wounldn't disagree that it is not the strongest arguments.  Other Scriptures, however, are much more clear.  And at last, a response to the arguments of the final argument:Argument 1: The Bible does not contain the teaching of complementarianisim and therefore that belief is unbiblical and therefore has no clout.  It is not God's intention, then, that sexual union must occur in heterosexual, monogomaus relationships within the covenent of marriage.  This is false because in actuality the teaching is in the Bible.  It is right in Genesis where this is truth is supressed in the wayward search for loophole for homosexual practice.  ""So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place."" (Gensis 2:21, NASB)The Hebrew word we get ""deep sleep"" from is tardemah and even suggests a trance and a type of ecstasy that Adam went under as God made woman from him.  It is suggestive of the reality that whom God made for him would be as promised, a suitable helper for him (since none was found previous to that).

These positions were politically charged with no basis in medical   science  , they claimed. Particularly, the ""gay gene"" theory has no basis in scientific fact. The APA top officials who were there seemed a bit shocked that this would be confronted so publicly, and promised to look into it. It appears that some wheels started turning.Yesterday the following article appeared in WorldNetDaily:Gay' gene claim suddenly vanishesAmerican Psychological Association revises statement on homosexualityMay 12, 2009By Bob Unruh, WorldNetDaily.comA publication from the American Psychological Association includes an admission that there is no ""gay"" gene, according to a doctor who has written about the issue on the website of National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality. A. Dean Byrd, the past president of NARTH, confirmed that the statement from the American Psychological Association came in a brochure that updates what the APA has advocated for years... However, in the update: a brochure now called, ""Answers to Your Questions for a Better Understanding of Sexual Orientation & Homosexuality,"" the APA's position changed. The new statement says: ""There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual, gay or lesbian orientation. Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation is determined by any particular factor or factors. Many think that nature and nurture both play complex roles. ...""""Although there is no mention of the research that influenced this new position statement, it is clear that efforts to 'prove' that homosexuality is simply a biological fait accompli have failed,"" Byrd wrote. ""The activist researchers themselves have reluctantly reached that conclusion. There is no gay gene. There is no simple biological pathway to homosexuality."" ..The ""Berlin Wall"" of propaganda may be close to coming down!

Man is classified as a member of the animal kingdom, and despite the fact the we are Spiritual creatures as well, we share common characteristics with the animal kingdom.  As I had mentioned elsewhere, I consider myself to be a Spiritual believer in the Heavenly Father and His Son.  Before the creation of Adam and Eve, Satan brought into the mortal Universe sin, which corrupted much of what God had intended for this world.  Adam and Eve agreed to commit themselves to sin, after being tempted and led into by Satan.  As a result, their offspring and all generations of human beings after them would be stained by the results of their actions.  From a Christian standpoint, this would include the genetic alteration of sexual orientation itself, which affected both people and animals.  To say that it is wrong for us to align the sexual orientations of people and animals is to ignore the reality of evil and its ability to originate from the soul.  Scripture tells us that humans are basically ""born of sin,"" which means that once our innocence in infancy has passed, our natural desires gain hold, and sin takes control.  As a result, animals and humans have been altered by the decisions that Adam and Eve had chosen in the Garden.  And that includes our gene pool, which determines our sexuality before birth.  More often than not, this is not a choice.  This is indeed something determined before birth because of sin, which came into the world before Adam was formed.

A. Van der Kemp, May 1, 1817). Further, Jefferson specifically named Joseph Priestly (English Unitarian) and Conyers Middleton (English Deist) and said: ""I rest on them ... as the basis of my own faith"" (letter to John Adams, Aug. 22, 1813). Therefore, not only did Jefferson deny the central tenants of Christianity, he also issued an authentic statement claiming Deism as his faith. As I said, unknowingly, but not unexpectedly, in concert with Encyclopedia Britannica, ""The second and third presidents of the United States also held Deistic convictions, as is amply evidenced in their correspondence."" Jefferson studied the philosophy of John Locke and the ""natural theology,"" which was the subject of Thomas Paine's ""The Age of Reason,"" and agreed with Paine's convictions that it was a grave injustice to lock God into a sacred text. Paine immeasurably influenced Jefferson's interpretation of the Bible, as evidenced by the so-called ""Jefferson Bible,"" which deliberately excludes the claims of Christ's divinity (...and to deny the divinity of Christ is to not be a Christian). For Thomas Paine, the only revelation from God is one that is perceived in creation. Only through creation does ""God speaketh universally to man."" To not understand Thomas Jefferson's philosophical relationship with his Deistic colleagues and with the Church is not to understand Thomas Jefferson.I think I have sourced TJ's Deism enough at least for my own satisfaction, if not for yours, but I will add that the following words appear in Volume 3 of Dumas Malone's rightfully celebrated biography, ""Jefferson and His Time,"" with regard to the accusation that Jefferson was an atheist: ""...it was not only made in the public press, it was hurled from pulpits in various places, most of all probably in Connecticut. ... Actually, he was a deist (481).""This whole problem about identifying the Creator mentioned in the Declaration of Independence reminds me of a similar problem Jefferson encountered with regard to the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom. He wrote in his autobiography, ""Where the preamble declares, that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, an amendment was proposed by inserting ""Jesus Christ,"" so that it would read 'A departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion;' the insertion was rejected by the great majority, in proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantle of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mohammedan, the Hindoo and Infidel of every denomination.""This is the very same vision of the Creator mentioned in the DoI; a creator that is accessible to people of all faiths because his name isn't Jesus Christ.All of this said, I don't know if I want to carry on defending gay marriage in this debate.

While one could argue back and forth all day about whether being adopted by a heterosexual or homosexual couple makes a difference, and admittedly it probably does, there is little doubt that loving parents of any sexuality would be better than the alternative.

Every notable twin study has shown that a greater percentage of monozygotic twins shared the same sexual orientation than the percentage of dizygotic twins. The fact that not all monozygotic twins share the same sexual orientation does not disprove a genetic link.  It simply suggests that other factors, most likely intrauterine, are involved -- most likely a complex process involving the mutation of certain fragile genes during early cell replications, along with hormonal changes which alter brain chemistry, received more by one twin than the other.  Monozygotic twins nearly always have some perceptible physiological differences, including mirror-image,where one twin is left-handed and has left-handed hair whorls, while the other is the opposite; size differences, due to unequal uterine blood supply; and even being of opposite genders, due to genetic mutations which take place after the the cell division in which the twins divide from one another. One would not expect that 100% of monozygotic twins would share the same sexual orientation.

John 3:16For God so loved the world he sent his only begotten son, that WHOSOEVER (hate to break it to you, that does include gay people) believes in him, shall not perish but have everlasting life. For the sake of arguement, let's say that a gay   christian   couple wants to get married, because they want to have sex after they get married, not before. Wouldn't that mean they are following what God is   teaching  ? Also, please point out versus where the Bible says being gay is wrong. Or how about John 8, 1-11? Let anyone among you who is without sin throw the first stone. There's also the issue of love. If I remember correctly, love is the word used most in the bible. Gay couples love each other, and they deserve to be loved. And the hate the sinner thing? It's like saying you don't like people being left handed, but you like left handed people.

If you are part of a same sex couple, you are quite obviously well aware that union WILL NOT PRODUCE CHILDREN. You are evidently of the view that human children should be a free market item of commerce, as available as a puppy at a pound. Even adoption of puppies these days is subject to a certain amount of screening by the better run shelters. Do you have a fenced yard? Do you have a stable home? Are you tempermentally suited to caring for a puppy? Etc.As stated previously, a stable, opposite sex parent home, is the ideal environment to raise children. Your three post rant shows nothing to refute that claim. That the researchers you cite won't waste their time trying to compare same sex couples to that model speaks for itself. They know better, and if you are at all honest, so do you.If you're gay, accept yourself for what you are and try to live the happiest and best life you can on that basis.

1030	gayRights	"I want to point out a seldom talked about but nevertheless very important point:Gay marriage absolutely does erode ""family"", and here is why: the church - the summation of all religious institutions - wants to control the relationship between children and parents. This is of utmost importance to the church, because parents are the most reliable tool of mass religious indoctrination; and because much of the ""sacred"" beliefs are delivered as interaction between parents and children, which the followers are supposed to model. This is why the church seeks to control both licensing to procreation (marriage) and procreation itself (promiscuity, abortions, gay marriage). Anyone who treads on these interests of the church is opposed by the church because losing any of these defense lines directly reduces the church's market which is never going to come back. Gay marriage does exactly what the conservatives are complaining about: the necessity to allow gay people to marry means taking away the marriage prerogative from the church. It directly results in less believers and thus harms the religious thought as a whole.Gay marriage destroys marriage and traditional values, and that's why it's a great thing."	FAVOR

The fact is, Jewish rabbis before, during and after the time of Christ, did discuss lesbianism and determined that lesbians are not included in the Levitical prohibitions.Your next assertion is more opinion, masquerading as fact.>>>>""Hence, Paul argues in this very passage that idolatry, in his mind, *leads* to this kind of ""vile affection"".""<<<<That is your opinion of Paul's argument. In point of fact, Paul's argument is focused on the consequences of idolatry, not an alleged condemnation of gay men and lesbians in Romans 1:26-27.Paul's argument posits idolatrous same sex activity - worship of the fertility goddess - as the result of idolatry.    To read Paul's words as a condemnation of faithful committed non-cultic same sex partnerships is an egregious mis-reading of the scriptures. It assumes ""facts"" not in evidence and reads into scripture what scripture manifestly does not say.Aristides, preaching and writing within 70 years of 58 A.D., (when Paul wrote Romans), understood Paul's words to refer to shrine prostitution.Justin Martyr, writing within 100 years of Paul, understood Paul to be speaking of shrine prostitution.

Usually, males get mostly ""lust for female"" genes and females get mostly ""lust for male"" genes, but sometimes, due to chromosome crossovers or other events during the genetic shuffle in the formation of a sperm, a male (Y) sperm may get mostly ""lust for male"" genes or a female (X) sperm mostly ""lust for female"" genes.

1044	gayRights	I suspect a philosophical fallacy in the Family Research CouncilÕs argument here. They write, ÒThis response is followed by Òthe purpose of marriage is to have childrenÓ (4 percent), which also recognizes a purposeful Ð and thus ÒnaturalÓ Ð design for human sexuality.Ó This, admittedly, may have some validity. Marriage, as it has been traditionally defined, may imply Òprocreation.Ó However, as David Hume argued, questions about what Òought to beÓ cannot be derived from questions about what Òis.Ó The fundamental question in this debate is: Should two consenting male adults, for example, be allowed the right to marry? To respond as FRC has done, by appealing to what ÒisÓ (or what has always been) and therefore what Òshould be,Ó is fallacious because these are two fundamentally different questions. As their argument rests on this assumption, it should be questioned for its validity.         	FAVOR
1045	gayRights	The commons sense answer is of course it is a sin. Those that beleive in scriptures and our heritage know that it is a sin.  Those that are practicing this behavior know in their hearts it is wrong.  The bible speaks of a time when that which is good is said to be bad and that which is bad will be said to be good.  We will then know that the end is coming soon.  The radical approach to this situation is proof enough of the legitimate points that I make.  Look at how the homosexual audience responded to the recent vote in California. They were ok with voting for BO even though he said marriage is for men and women yet they didn't picket the Black race who voted overwhelmingly against gay marriage. They didn't picket the Muslims who are on record as being against gay marriage.  They violently went after the LDS church.  A church that is very very small and have always been against gay marriage and who are only exercising their God given right to disagree.  So why the violent approach?  Simple really.

That's not saying that there aren't peaceful and loving MuslimsÑit's saying that a nation is being ran via Islam by it's governing powers, which, according to Scripture, brings ruin upon itself by dismissing the person and holiness of Jesus and teaching their entire people to dismiss it as well. I personally believe that a nation of authentic believers in Christ running the country would be just and free of crime, pain, suffering, etceteraÑoh wait, that would be Heaven. But sin is in the world and a country based on Christ's truth and faith and peace (not religion?) isn't going to happen here on earth. So we do the best we can with a democracy that guarantees protection of religion.Your second point: I know for a fact that some people DO choose to ""be gay"" as one of my friends is newly gay, but didn't used to be, but after one too many hurts by the opposite sex and a desperate need to be cared for decided to give the other side a try. (And it should be noted that we hear each other's views on the subject with respect and agree to disagree but are still good friends.) There's also the perfect illustration of choosing in bisexuals, who can't seem to ""choose"" which sex they prefer. It is a choice in the end, even if it's an inclination one is born with, as I said in my original argument. I don't even begin to know how you came to compare gay marriage to allowing someone with dyslexia to marry? Re-read my original argument about the necessity of marriage being male/female. Marriage is a holy union between a man and a womanÑit is not a civil union (although many treat it as such)Ñand that is why so many people have a problem with legalizing gay marriage. It would erode the foundation and meaning of marriage according to God, which is sacred to believers. You don't want to believe in GodÑhey, that's between you and Him and every human being has that free choiceÑno one is forcing or condemning anyone. All that believers are doing is defending their faith-based, holy sacraments so that others can't redefine them when they don't even believe in them. I mean there really is a contradiction there, right? Christians don't marry for financial reasons (at least they're not supposed to) or things like thatÑit is to pledge the marriage to God, to request His blessing. Let me ask you something: What's wrong with homosexuality being a choice? I mean, if homosexuals are confident and proud of their sexual preference, why the need to say that the trait is inborn? Why all the shame? ""Fundamentalism"" is defined as a strong adherence to any set of beliefs in the face of criticism and unpopularity. I am by no means a perfect Christian, but I am trying to be an authentic Christian and not a casual one, so I guess if that makes me a fundamentalist, then I guess I am? But be careful about labeling when you so clearly and ""fundamentally"" adhere to your own beliefs. Diversity goes both ways my friend. ;)Oh, and Prop 8, was voted down by a democracy, not by religionÑthe majority deemed it not to be acceptable, to use your own words."	AGAINST

1060	gayRights	Hello,Pardon the delay.Is sex a crime? No, sex is not a crime. Can a crime be committed by sex? Yes, rape is a crime against another person, which generally implies forced sex. Is the desire for sex a crime? (No) Can a crime be committed as a consequence of a desire for sex? Yes, for a rapist desires to have forced sex with another person. In these examples it can be seen that neither sex nor the desire for sex are crimes and that some crimes are sexual. All physically, healthy men and women are fully capable of committing sexual crimes. However, and thankfully, most do not commit sexual crimes. Most men and women choose to not force themselves sexually unto another person. They are therefore making a conscious decision. Furthermore, all decisions about with whom they will have sex with are choices evidencing their desire. The desires of all men and women are consequences, not causes. Then what is the cause of desire? Is it internal or external? Is it genetic? In order to answer these questions I must begin with some fundamentals of the lives of all men and women.All men and women are responsible for the choices they make; they both suffer or benefit from the consequences of their choices; they also cannot rightfully be held accountable for the choices that others have made. For example, Person (A) cannot be justly imprisoned because of the crimes of person (B). Also, if person (A) is coerced by person (B) to perform a certain act or speak a certain word, person (A) has chosen to comply and is therefore responsible. Person (A) suffers the consequences of compliance or resistance; in either situation, person (A) remains responsible for his/her choices. Regardless of the specific choices that men and women make, all choices are consequences of their desires. Ultimately, we can conclude that all men and women will choose according to their desire and must accept the consequences whether they are joyful or sorrowful. The desire of man is predicated upon at least one value system. And from that value system are all desires identifiable. Simply stated, the value systems are as follows:1) My needs are more important than the needs of another person. (Identity=selfish,unjust)2) My needs are equally as important as the needs of another person. (Identity=just,honest)3) My needs are less important than the needs of another person. (Identity=affectionate)I have completed my response. But I have only posted part no.1. We can debate this part before we move on to part 2. I have yet to logically tie the pieces together.	AGAINST

1064	gayRights	"Thanks for the reply, Rick.You said ""The idea is that Jesus in His life, death and resurrection, fulfilled all the demands of the Law, therefore we are not required to keep the Law ourselves to be right with God.""In other words, Jesus died not only so that we could be forgiven for all the sins committed BEFORE he died, but also so that we had a path to be forgiven for the one's committed AFTER his death (i.e. today).  Right?  But forgiveness still requires not only that we repent, but also that we accept Jesus as the only path to penitence.  And that's the part I don't like.  It's off the current topic, but to me forgiveness has to come only from the person I've wronged, and not from Jesus or god, or any other supernatural being.  That's because my secular morality is based on respect for HUMANS, not respect for god.  To me it's offensive that  hurting another person is considered ""sinful"" because it violates the law of god, rather than because it violates of rights of a person.  It's offensive that repentant murderers ask for god's forgiveness, rather than the forgiveness of their victims and their families, and find peace through god without regard to the person they've killed.  But all this is for another discussion.  Since homosexuality hurts no PERSON, it is not immoral, although I acknowledge that it is ""sinful"" according to your arbitrary religious dogma.  Sid"	FAVOR

I have struggled wtih homosexuality since I hit puberty (6+years) and in the past identified as gay, homosexual, a Christian walking out of homosexuality, ex-gay and at last I can say that I am so glad I shed the false identities the world and the enemy of my soul wanted me to believe because he who is free in the Son of God is free indeed.  Although I still struggle with homosexuality at some level it is nothing compared to what it used to be and I have developed attractions for woman (something I never, never in my wildest imaginatinos thought would be possible no matter how many times I quoted all things are possible with God).  This article claims that homosexuals interperate the Bible differently because they approach it with their own suppositions (private interpretation) and then accuses those who actually believe what the text says of doing it.  It is falid and a satanic deception to those struggling with their gender and sexual idnentity.

1073	gayRights	It's not saying they aren't since anymore, but sin is not dealt in the same way as in the old testament. This doesn't mean that the condition of sin is lightened, it is the same, but Jesus sacrifice plays a huge role when it comes to forgiveness. Now because of Jesus we can be saved, we are able to be forgiven and called righteous as long as we repent from our sins (meaning turning away from our sinful nature) and chose to live for Jesus. Isaiah 53 talks about Jesus death on the cross. These are just parts of it.5 But he was pierced for our rebellion,      crushed for our sins.   He was beaten so we could be whole.      He was whipped so we could be healed. 6 All of us, like sheep, have strayed away.      We have left GodÕs paths to follow our own.   Yet the Lord laid on him      the sins of us all. This part talks about How He became an offering for sin on the cross. 10 But it was the LordÕs good plan to crush him      and cause him grief.   Yet when his life is made an offering for sin,      he will have many descendants.   He will enjoy a long life,      and the LordÕs good plan will prosper in his hands. 11 When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish,      he will be satisfied.   And because of his experience,      my righteous servant will make it possible   for many to be counted righteous,      for he will bear all their sins.Notice how it talks about many because not everyone will turn to Jesus for salvation.So just to make sure I answer your questions1) Adultery, theft as well as homosexuality and other sins are still sins. And I believe they aren't any less of sins. 2) Basically the there is judgement, however Jesus did pay for our sins so repentance plays a huge role. He can take away judgement from us if we turn away from our ways and surrender to Him. 	AGAINST

But fathers can definitely talk about it as well (even though it might be a bit uncomfortable).To quickly state my piece:Yes, I believe gay parents should be able to adopt. I do not think a child needs a mother and father to get a healthy perspective on things.

I think one of the main reasons it makes people so uncomfortable is that everyone feels like they know how to rear children the best, whether it is with homosexual parents, hetoersexual parents, single parents, or whatever.

Second of all, people who are not married face a myriad of issues which their married counterparts do not face such as access to one's partner when in hospital, access to healthcare, insurance, and more. While more and more companies are adapting their policies, it requires an act by government to extend the same rights across all, and the only reasonable approach is to recognize same sex marriages as no different from 'traditional marriages"".Certainly the argument that it somehow trivializes 'traditional marriage' would be a flawed one, the argument that same sex relationships face no discrimination is easily laid to rest by pointing to some self evident facts to the contrary.And so far I have failed to hear any good reason why marriage for same sex couples should be kept illegal?"

Because Jesus intentionally differentiated between born eunuchs and metaphysical eunuchs who voluntarily decide not to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage, it makes sense to conclude that born eunuchs are:a. not required to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage (since Jesus intentionally opts them out)b. not required to abstain from marrying an orientation compatible partner (since Jesus intentionally differentiates them from metaphysical eunuchs who make a personal decision not to participate in Adam and Eve style marriage).

Well of course, children should no how people relate to each other as male and female.

They are given what they need, but know that they are not a part of that family. Love is not a sexual issue. Everyone needs love!It seems overall that people are people and none of us are perfect.

I guess it is fair to conclude you believe heterosexual rape is ""okay"" ans not a sin as well. You obviously haven't studied the subject of sin period. I have a good link to my page that I wrote, regarding to what sin is, check it out here:       Yes, Romans 1 is talking about idolatry. Because people idolized many things and not God, he gave them over to their ""FOOLISH"" desires: same gender attractions. He also described the same gender relationships as ""vile"" and ""unnatural."" If something is unnatural, it means God did not create it for thaat purpose in nature. So homosexual practices are not something God intended to happen. Something that is considered bad and unnatural by God can not be good. He gave those people who were idolators over to their sinful desires, such as homosexual practices. Yes there was worshipping of sex goddesses. Homosexuality does stem from idolatry, because men and women were idolizing not only sex godesses, but others of the same sex. Unlike other sins, this sexual sin has a judgment administered by God Himself: He gives them over to their passions (Rom. 1:26-28). This means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins. As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance. Without repentance, there will be no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation. Also, a homosexual ""partnership"" would be very sinful regardless, because sex outside of marriage is a ""sin"" and marriage was to be between a man and woman, not two males or two females. I am not judgemental towards homosexuality, as it is just one of many sins, although it can be more emotional and harder to overcome. There are more passages on homosexuality is wrong throughout scripture:1) Lev. 18:22: ""You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination."" 2) Lev. 20:13, ""If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them."" 3)1 Cor. 6:9-10, ""Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals1, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.""

Just because scriptures have been used out of context and manipulated in the past by people with harmful and wicked agendas does not invalidate their veracity.  For our ancestors to use scripture to defend the institution of American slavery was to use scripture out of context.  In the same way, to use scripture to defend the acceptability of homosexual behavior is to use it out of context.  I appreciate the quote by George MacDonald:  ""To give truth to him who loves it not is only to give him more plentiful material for misrepresentation.""The point has been made by many that Christ never said anything condemning homosexuality.  However, there is also an absence of biblical condemnation of slavery.  In fact, it gave regulations for slaves and slave owners (slavery during Greco-Roman era was vastly different than the atrocity of Western-European and American slavery).  This line of thinking was used by slave owners to justify their position which contradicted the biblical doctrine of man.  If there is a parallel in this discussion of homosexuality, it is the use of the same strategy to justify homosexual behavior.    This argument and other arguments regarding the issues surrounding slavery cannot be effectively utilized in defending homosexuality.  The major difference is that there are multiple scriptural references condemning homosexual behavior.  People cannot defend sexual practices clearly condemned by biblical teaching in the same way as our Òpro-slaveryÓ Christian ancestors may have done in defending slavery.  There cannot be the claim that the Bible actually affirms this practice and offers no condemnation of it.  Therefore, to claim that scripture is being used to promote the condemnation of homosexuality in the same manner as it was to promote the establishment of American slavery is invalid.  "	AGAINST

Their bloodguiltness is upon themÓ 1 Cor. 6:9-10, ÒOr do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.Ó Verse 11 says ""and such WERE some of you.. but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.""(Notice the past tense, WERE!  When they came to Christ, He changed them from the inside out.  It can happen I have seen it happen!  Rom. 1:26-28, ÒFor this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper.ÓHomosexuality is clearly condemned by the Bible. It goes against the created order of God. He created Adam and then made a woman. This is what God has ordained and it is what is right. Unlike other sins, homosexuality has a severe judgment administered by God Himself. This judgment is simple: They are given over to their passions. That means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins (Romans 1:18ff). As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance and trusting in Jesus. Without Jesus, they will have no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation.It is mentioned 5 times in Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments.  So it is not a cultural thing!  Nor is it, as Rick B. is trying to say, just a cultural thing that Paul was dealing with.  It is an issue of morality, one in which Jesus did not erase!  The Old Testament dietary laws and sacrificial laws were completed in Christ.  However the moral laws were never abolished.  Other places do mention what the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was.  (Jeremiah 23:14) Some may ask, ""Why should we arbitrarily select only heterosexual couples for marriage? What can it hurt if two homosexuals want to marry?"" The answer is surprisingly simple. The institution of marriage between and man a woman is not, in fact, arbitrary. It's purpose is clear and of utmost importance to society. Mentioned 5 times in both Old and New Testaments, called an abomination, unnatural, lustful, perverse, it is no wonder that the person who commits such and does not repent of that sin will not enter heaven! You can't have Jesus and homosexuality also.  The two do not mix, like   oil   and water. God's word is final in all matters, not history! "	AGAINST
1153	gayRights	"From Letter to Louise:Genesis 18:20 to 19:29--The Sodom StorySome consider the sin of Sodom to be same-gender sex, although we are not told in Genesis what Sodom's sins were, only that they were so great that God determined to destroy the city. On the evening before its destruction he sent two angels, in disguise as men, to the city to lead Lot and his family out early the next day. Hospitable Lot invited them to spend the night at his house. During the evening the men of the city surrounded the house and demanded of Lot that he bring the two men out so that they could [19:5]King James Version: ""know them.""Revised Standard Version: ""know them.""New International Version: ""have sex with them.""When Lot refused to bring his guests out, the men of the city were about to break his door down when the angels struck them all blind and the mob dispersed. The next day Lot and his family were led out of Sodom, and the city was destroyed by fire and brimstone from heaven.The Hebrew verb used here, ""yadha,"" ""to know,"" is used 943 times in the OT and only ten times clearly to mean ""have sex,"" then it always means heterosexual sex. The word normally used for homosexual sex is ""shakhabh."" Many scholars believe that in Gen. 19:5 yadha means ""know"" in the sense of ""get acquainted with"" (the city's men may have wondered if these were enemy spies or they might have sensed the city's impending doom and been concerned with what these strangers were doing there) and have several arguments for this, including Sodom's being used as an example of great sin numerous times in the Old and New Testaments with nothing ever said about same-sex sex, and the context of Jesus' references to Sodom (Luke 10:10-13) which seems to imply lack of hospitality as the sin.Other scholars think it was the common practice of showing dominance over and humiliating outsiders by forcing them to take the part of a (an inferior) woman in a same-gender rape.Others think it means ""have sex,"" and point to Lot's offering his two virgin daughters to the crowd if sex is what they want, if they will just leave his guests alone. If this is the right interpretation, it is clearly about violent, criminal, gang rape, something always condemnable.Another thought is expressed by Religion Professor David L. Bartlett: ""This story is certainly an unlikely starting point for a `biblical' understanding of sexual ethics. While the attempted homosexual rape by the men of Sodom is explicitly condemned, the offer by Lot to hand his two virgin daughters over to the violent and lecherous inhabitants of Sodom is related without a word of judgment.""B-2Conservative theologian Richard Hays says, ""The notorious story of Sodom and Gomorrah--often cited in connection with homosexuality--is actually irrelevant to the topic.""B-3There is nothing in this story applicable to our consideration of homosexuality."

1154	gayRights	In advocating same-sex marriage, we acknowledge that any two people who love each other should be able to marry each other, and children, in a safe and loving environment, will be raised well by any parents.  We do, of course, have to lay certain restrictions on love and marriage, for the sake of the exploited and the offspring (in the case of incest).  Children cannot marry each other, for they are not mature enough to consent to a commitment and to sexual relations.  An adult cannot marry a child, for the child still cannot consent.  Nor can bestiality be toleratedÑit is abusive to the animalÑor (generally speaking) incest, since the offspring of that relationship would be unfairly subjected to the genetic disturbances consequent of inbreeding.  The great irony of the Alliance Defense FundÕs argument is that they expose the bias of those who might advocate same sex marriage with one hand, and decry other sound marriages with the other.Those marriages between consenting adults must be tolerated, unless it is an incestuous relationship that may produce children.  We do not have to be comfortable with itÑif we cannot deny it based on logic, then government and society must be tolerant of others beliefs.  I am a practicing Catholic, and I wholeheartedly side with my church on issues of incest and polygamy, but I cannot ask my government to make laws against them, for my beliefs in their immorality are founded in religious dogma, not secular reason, and as such, it would be unjust, and un-Christian, of me to force my religious dogma upon other people.

Most people only believe in one of the thousands of gods we have invented. Some go one god further and become 100% atheists.Now then, any argument against same sex marriage that makes reference to any of the gods we have invented is not an argument at all.Laws made by the state should not rely on such fake arguments. The state should use science base its decisions on evidence.In contrast, faith is belief in something not based on any evidence. Churches of course are welcome to use their version of god any time and make their decision based of faith.It is, however, dishonest to put faith and truth in the same sentence. Only evidence and truth belong together.Separation of church and state means freedom OF and FROM religion.People using their god argument against same sex marriage, are welcome to use it within their church but join the 21st century and let the state make decisions that do not discriminate anyone.We have a supreme court for a reason: to prevent any majority from discriminating against a minority.Be happy within your faith and let other be happy within theirs or be happy without any faith."

1161	gayRights	You're making the assumption that homosexuality is not natural - that only sex between man and woman is natural and therefore what binds them together.  Homosexuality is quite natural. It exists in nature between animals and also in humans. You're also making the assumption that marriage has typically been between one man and one woman.  As if the entire world has always shared this decidedly Christian view.  Furthermore, in most societies - including those ancestral societies you speak of in which the child was better off with the biological mother and father - the raising of the child has typically been a group effort. It's only been in our society, within the past 200 years that this has changed.  What benefits children is having as many people as possible in their lives who love and support them.  It makes little difference if these people are biologically related, or married.  Gay marriage isn't about raising children, it's the right that exists to bind yourself to a person for rest of your life if you so choose.  Placing another factor in the mix doesn't say anything about the original argument - that gay marriage is wrong.And further to that - marriage is a religious act.

One cannot rightly demand liberty while at the same time stepping all over the liberties of others to obtain it.Nevertheless, historically, the major religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are far more often the perpetrators of damage to liberties than are other points of view. It has long been their sense of self-righteousness that has led to an assumption they own the cultures in which they find themselves and can therefore dictate the lifestyles of all.

They are both part of the Old Testament Holiness Code, a religious, not a moral code; it later became the Jewish Purity Laws. [""Abomination"" is used throughout the Old Testament to designate sins that involve ethnic contamination or idolatry. The word relates to the failure to worship God or to worshiping a false god; it does not relate to morality.] Professor Soards tell us, ""Old Testament experts view the regulations of Leviticus as standards of holiness, directives for the formation of community life, aimed at establishing and maintaining a people's identity in relation to God.""B-4 This is because God was so determined that his people would not adopt the practices of the Baal worshipers in Canaan, and same-gender sex was part of Baal worship. (The laws say nothing about women engaging in same-gender sex; probably this had to do with man's dominance, and such acts by the subservient had nothing to do with religious impurity.)God required purity for his worship. Anything pure was unadulterated, unmixed with anything else These Purity Laws prohibited mixing different threads in one garment, sowing a field with two kinds of seed, crossbreeding animals. A few years ago in Israel when an orthodox government came into power, McDonalds had to stop selling cheeseburgers. Hamburgers, OK. Cheese sandwiches, OK. But mixing milk and meat in one sandwich violated the Purity Laws--it had nothing to do with morality. These were laws about worshipping God, not ethics, and so have no bearing on our discussion of morality. Helmut Thielicke remarks on these passages: ""It would never occur to anyone to wrench these laws of cultic purification from their concrete situation and give them the kind of normative authority that the Decalogue, for example, has.""B-5Another reason they are not pertinent to our discussion is that these laws were for the particular time and circumstances existing when they were given. If you planted a fruit tree, you could not eat its fruit until its fifth year, and all fruit the fourth year must be offered to the Lord. A worker must be paid his wage on the day of his labor. You must not harvest a field to its edge. We readily dismiss most of them as not applicable to our day and culture, and if we dismiss some of them for any reason, we have to dismiss all of them, including the sexual regulations, for that same reason.When we add the fact that these laws were talking about heterosexuals, it makes three reasons, any one of which would be sufficient, why they have no bearing on questions about homosexuals or homosexuality or on the morality of same-gender sex by homosexuals today."

Religious groups have been free to pursue their own beliefs since this nation was founded, even when those beliefs have been odious to the general population.  Churches were among the main proponents of antimiscegenation laws, which prevented people of different races from intermarrying.  When those laws were overturned, churches continued to preach against interracial marriage, and even to refuse to marry interracial couples.  A couple was denied marriage as recently as 2000 because the bride was white and the groom was black.  To my knowledge, no legal action has taken place against the church involved:        The Roman Catholic Church has been denying holy orders to women and denying marriage to previously divorced persons for their entire existence in this country, and has never been the successful target of a lawsuit or prosecution for these activities.The separation of Church and State is strong enough in this country to protect churches from undue interference from civil legislation which affects other agencies and non-profits.

God gives people who want out of this life, understanding, as he did for me. I believe one can be free from feelings, it takes work.  We are all built with a conscience. And something inside of me knew gay feelings were wrong at a young age, I just didnt know why. The church never told me it was wrong, society, or people, I just knew. I think we all can try to remember those first emotions. And so its all ungodly emotions.  Relationships become co-dependant, and we use others to fulfill the pain. Whether its sex or relationship. Nothing is good in homosexuality..Nothing..it's call disfunctional, and can be healed.If you're gay, you understand hurt..and rejection..fear...disappointment..guilt..anger..being left out and misunderstood. A gay lifestyle offers many promises. Freedom, independence, pride, sympathetic understanding, compassion, fulfilled desires, honesty. Being honest about our feelings is so important. Unlike others, the homosexual has struggled through two traumatic births: the natural birth, and the personal birth of self-acceptance. Both passages are marked by pain and great labor, but the product of the natural birth doesn't remember. The product of the personal birth remembers always. However, a Cruel Deception torments the gay community. Once the ""birth"" is accomplished and the person comes out of the closet, the promises are not kept. At first there may be relief, pleasure, and the euphoria of belonging. But can the gay lifestyle ever satisfy the deepest desires and longings of the homosexual man or woman? Could all that freedom, pride and sexual activity be covering up feelings? At best, it brings temporary diversion. At worst unfortunately, it brings despair and death. Why? Because those desires, longings, hurts, and fears are common to humanity and are the result of living in a fallen world. Everyone is affected, and only God can save, heal, and satisfy. We must realize that in most instances, the attraction for the same sex begins before the age of ten and is usually non-sexual, emotional, and involuntary. This brings confusion, fear, and guilt on a young person who is already feeling rejected and unworthy, and increases the need for affirmation. It is very common to experience injured, rejected femininity or insecure masculinity. With sexual maturity, the needs become eroticized and the sexual desire is strong because it is linked to the emotions.  Sexual activity then becomes a way to feel loved and affirmed, and becomes addictive; we cover the pain with pleasure; we idolize someone like us and are esteemed by them; there is some relief from identity confusion, and we can defy, and have some refuge from, a hostile society. But, has this really dealt with the buried emotions, or are we caught in a pattern of behavior that covers them? There is a strong connection between buried feelings and sexual complusion. God has shown all those who have gotten free that all this was changeable, and He wants to go through the process with you. He wants you to experience the intimacy with Him that overcomes all addictive behavior. You will never have intimacy that can compare with the intimacy with God, who loves and cares for you. God does not want to judge you, He wants to save, forgive, deliver, heal, restore, comfort, renew - all the things that only He can do. For these wonderful things to happen, you will need another birth...the spiritual birth. We all do, because we are fallen, and a fallen world has imposed wounds, fears, alienation and identity confusion on us, and we reacted in sinful ways to compensate, console, and protect ourselves. Jesus Christ came for that very reason, to save the lost and helpless. Come to him and let him do his marvelous work in your life..Let His Love heal the wounds; let His goodness dispel the fears; let his presence replace the loneliness; let his grace and mercy cover all your sins, and let Him give you a new identity as His child.

1218	gayRights	"In the opening chapter of Romans the Apostle Paul is not listing a command of ""do's and don'ts"" but a listing of chronology of the falleness and depravity of mankind.  St. Paul is going back to the early history of man's rebellion in turning a way from the true, one and only living God and to the worship of created things and other types of idolatry.  Because of this God gave them over to a depraved mind.  A chief sign of this rebellion is the inappropriate sexual actions between women and men.  It is clear in this homosexual action a high abomination is occurring because it is going directly against the created design of  God as revealed in Genesis.  It is a rejection of God and his way and an embracing of a counterfeit.  This is why prevalent homosexuality in a society is a sign that a society is moving away from God and his truth in open rebellion.  It may seem extreme to the modern person but not anymore extreme than the call of all disciples to deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow him.  Jesus makes a way out.  As someone who has and does struggle with homosexuality this is something I can attest to that the walk is not fun or easy but it is what is truth and what God calls all sinners too, repentance.

1226	gayRights	"Addressing your first point, of course there are modern developements in calling legally recognized relationships between same sex couples ""marriage"", that is why it is worth debating, whereas as little as ten or twenty years ago it was not. I was speaking in the broad scope of human history, and in that great span, this misapplication of the more traditional term of ""marriage"" to some form of relationship between a couple who are of the same sex IS new and IS unprecedented, particularly noteworthy is the use of the law as a weapon to force the new definition of the word ""marriage"" on everybody else against their consent in the name of equality and liberty for all.I assure you words DO have meaning, and pondering that meaning is neither ""vacuous"" or ""pseoudo intellectual"". Some of the greatest intellectuals of Western Civilization are on my side on this one. Descarte, Aristotle, Newton, poets like Shakespeare, and Thoreau (who has been speculated as being homosexual by the way) all poured over the fine nuance and meaning of the words they used. And we have benefited greatly from them.Of course the meaning of words change over time, but the underlying reality does not. Some words are reaplied to have new meaning, but the thing refered to has remaind unchanged in its underlying nature. The same bird is called by different names in different languages; and while some words may change faster than others, changing the word does not change the bird.Any culture that values its heritage will naturally want to defend that culture from uncontrolled change including its own language, and it is natural and good that it should do this it is the practice of a form of social self preservation. This may sound academic, but it is not! It is exactly what is practiced by the government in French Canadia. They censor and conrol their printed media, street signs, and advertising billboards so as to assure adherence to the standard French language in word use and spelling. This may seem outlandish to the provintial mind, but begs the question...why do they do it? Because they value their own culture.I do not venture to put myself on the side of government cencorship of all printed media, but surely our American society if it values its own cultural heritage at all, must atleast protect its language within the confines of the written law.If sufficient demand for civil unions passes the standard of civil debate and law, that is fine. But no equivelant forum exists for the passage of redefining the meaning of words. Unlike in French Canadia, there are no language police. As law is nothing but the accumulation of words, the manipulation and steady curruption of those words will lead to the destruction of those laws original meaning, either in word, or in practice as those ignorant of the past will be unable to understand the true meaning of the words as they were intended.This is not hypothetical. The Spanish conquistadors destroyed their conquered Aztec subject's written histories and records for a reason, to bring about the destruction of their civilization.As for interracial marriage, i have already addressed that issue, please read the previous post more carefully.My 1984 reference was about the ministry of Truth, which systematically corrupted the language by deminishing the number of words and broadening each remaining words application, thereby diluting its meaning. The speaker posits this is exaclty what is occuring in the case of legal use of the term ""gay marriage"", for the reasons stated in the primary statement.This speaker did not state ""that same-sex marriage could lead to 'a state of total decay and ruin.'"" The inner statement was taken out of context, see previous argument. Neither has this speaker sought to discredit same sex unions, either in principle or in law. The speaker wishes to make clear the distinction between using the word marriage in the traditional sense and in the new same-sex sense in which it is being applied. Proponents of the use of language of so called ""gay marriage"" would have you believe there is no difference between the two definitions, while simultaneously insisting that their new definition be accepted; which is a contradiction."

As a SIMPLE scientific test, I would be getting at least a 100 samples of each group. 100 from same gender parents and 100 from heterosexual parents. I would then devide these into groups of 10. These groups would be of the equivelant social standing. ie 10 middle class families of each group, 10 of minority groups of the same standing, 10 of groups with siblings and 10 with no siblings and so on until major groups of families are represented. This would be a simple experiment otherwise a lot more than 100 from each group would be needed.Then we would study these children and compare as they grow up, go to school, middle school, high school, college, University. We would continue as they get jobs and begin the journey of life. The study would continue when they get married, their marriage would be studied. Their behavior with their spouses, and when they have children how they treat and deal with their children. This would have to continue until they're about 60 years old. The data would constantly be compared and only then we MAY have some kind of an idea of how these children were Influenced, disadvantaged or not. Many scientific studies which involve human behavior have taken generations of scientists who inherit the study from previous scientists who spent a lifetime studying certain people.Now you know why I said there can not be aby scientific proof as yet, since the adoption policy by the same gender parents has not been out for long enough time.Again let me reiterate that I'm not saying we shouldn't let same gender partners adopt children or have custody of children, but what I am saying is that those children are at a disadvantage.

Perverts are so quick to point out that they are homosexuals, I don't see people on TV running around yelling 'I'm hetero'. Years ago the perverts were out in the streets protesting that the Federal gov. wasn't spending enough money on AIDS research. Excuse me? It's like Reagan said: AIDS is almost a fully presentable disease - don't share needles, and wear a condom if you are going to insert your penis into another human being's rectum. But, but, the perverts don't like the way it feels if they have to wear a condom, and they want your tax dollars to be used to find a cure, so they can just go out to homosexuals bars, pop a pill, and then go insert their penis into a rectum. AIDS is rampant in parts of Africa - up to 70% of the population of some countries have the virus - because the men refuse to wear condoms. Why? Because it doesn't feel good, so the vast majority of people, married, single, man and woman end up with the AIDS virus. Some perverts think they can trick people into making people believe they are hetero by getting married to a woman, and at the same time they are engaging in risky behavior performing perverted acts on other perverts. So now there is a risk of a woman contracting AIDS because she is unwittingly involved with a lying pervert.	AGAINST

This presumably acknowledges (correctly) that sexual orientation is NOT a choice people make.  You're either gay or you're straight.  And just as I did not choose to be straight, homosexuals don't choose to be gay.  Sexual orientation is simply one aspect of yourself that you discover as you mature.  This is another reason why I don't believe that BEING gay is immoral.  Where there is no choice morality does not attach.  Being gay (or straight) is neither moral not immoral.  Sexual orientation, like height or hair color, is simply not a moral issue.  This being said, regardless of your orientation, whom you have sex with and what kind of sex you have ARE choices that we make.  And so my question is; Is it reasonable for a Christian to accept that a person IS homosexual, while condemning them for ACTING in a homosexual fashion?  Obviously I don't think it is reasonable.

Looking at humanity over the past hundred thousand years you can see that we are social creatures. Therefore, we have not evolved as individuals, but in small groups. In fact, this same process describes how we developed morals. Those societies whose members didn't kill each other survived better. In times of need societies whose members worked for the common good, and didn't make selfish decisions that hurt the group, lasted longer. I tend to be a critic of religion, but those societies that developed religion were able to last longer then those that didn't have traditions for the same reasons.But I digress...Individual homosexuals help the group as a whole to survive better. Therefore if we look at evolution of groups of individuals, and not of the individuals themselves we see that those groups that had a certain percentage of homosexuals in them would survive and pass their genes along.As usual, no deity is needed.

1293	gayRights	"Audrey, I'm glad you are happy with the choices you have made, but please try not to make the mistake of assuming that everyone's life, experience and sexuality mirrors your own.  I'm going to make some educated guesses, here, and you can feel free to disagree with them or disavow them as you like.  You've made some assumptions about ""all gay people,"" so it is, perhaps, only fair that others make a few about you.Sometimes when you spend a lot of time thinking about a topic, your vision can become a little narrow and it is easy to assume that everyone else must be seeing things the same way you do.  If they claim to see them differently, then it becomes quite natural to assume they must be lying.However, if you can attempt to look beyond your own experience for a moment, it is important to know that there are many, MANY gay and lesbian people who were not abused, molested, rejected or overly controlled by our parents.  Many gay people had perfectly average, typical, relatively uneventful childhoods.You may have made ""choices"" in your early adulthood which caused you to decide to enter a relationship with a woman.  Your innate ability to be sexually attracted to a woman, though, probably did not arise from any ""choice"" that you made or any bad experience in your childhood, but rather, from a sexual orientation which allowed you to be attracted to persons of either gender -- bisexuality.  Some folks are more drawn to opposite gendered individuals while some are more drawn to same-gendered individuals.  Some, however, seem to fall somewhere in the middle.  And for a person who is already feeling confused and vulnerable because of a less-than-ideal childhood, such feelings for people of both genders might be quite confusing.Onto that, then, you layer the convictions taught to you in childhood (or possibly adulthood) that same-gender attractions are ""bad"" or ""sinful.""  Since you, as perhaps a bisexual woman -- I don't know you, and can only guess based upon the history you present -- feel attractions to both genders, it would be quite natural for you to assume that EVERYONE has a similar experience, but that some people choose the ""wrong"" gender, while others choose the ""right"" gender, and that those who choose the ""wrong"" gender are making a ""sinful"" choice, based upon the religious teachings you've been indoctrinated with, or chosen to follow.You then may assume that you chose the ""wrong"" gender BECAUSE of those bad experiences in your childhood, and that if you hadn't had those experiences, you would not have been tempted to choose the ""wrong"" gender for your loving attachments.The problem is, everyone is not you.  Many people truly are NOT attracted to people of both genders.  Most are attracted entirely or mostly to people of the opposite gender.  Some, probably far fewer, are attracted entirely or mostly to people of their own gender.  A few, probably like you, are attracted more or less equally to both.  And regardless of whether we have idyllic childhoods, brutal childhoods, or something in between, we will still be attracted to the gender to which we are innately attracted.  It is really easy to draw conclusions about others based upon your own experiences, but probably more helpful and mature in the long run to LISTEN to the experiences and self-knowledge of others and to try to understand that their experiences and feelings are every bit as valid and true for them as yours are for you.

However, those who choose to go with their desires and follow the gay path with all it's goods also have to accept it's bads. Marriage is accepted as a bond between Man and WIFE. With it comes legal and moral rights and obligations. And some of us do actually still respect them. There are alot of people who aren't able, for one reason or another to marry the partner of their choice, who aren't gay. Do you think a brother and sister should be able to get married if they fall in love. Certain religions will only allow men from their religion to marry women from their religion.And a man who respects that religion will abide by that rule Some nationalities wont allow interracial marriages..

There are many great organizations, such as Courage, which help men and women to live chaste lives in spite of their same-sex attractions.

But even if you live a low-risk lifestyle, you still might get cancer because of your genes. The greatest benefit to knowing a family history of cancer is not that you live trying to avoid cancer, but that you go in frequently for testing. This raises the odds that any cancer will be found early and treated. None of this harms the idea that there may also be unavoidable genetic factors to homosexuality.  Furthermore, all research shows that sexuality is fairly well solidified by the time a child is born; people come out at 18, they don't turn gay then. So the environmental factors that cause or effect homosexuality are likely prenatal or occur quite early in development. As to your claim that gays in ""reparative therapy"" treatment are unhappy with themselves and their gender, the gays I know that aren't in ""reparative therapy"" are happy with themselves and their gender.

The Old Testament is filled with laws governing the sexual relationships between men and women, give me one, just one, instance of God's laws favoring healthy sexual relationships between two men or two women.

Lev. 20:13.Any other interpretation of God's word to the contrary of Homosexuality as sin is a direct assult on God's moral integrety.Finally, in conclusion, The laws of God are a teacher to expose sin as being truly sinful. Some sins are greater than others and so incurred an immediate death sentence like rape, beastiality, homosexuality, incest, etc. However, there are others that, yet still sinful, don't incur an immediate death sentence like this one;(Deu 22:5)  ""A woman shall not wear man's clothing, nor shall a man put on a woman's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God.""This is were I disagree with J. Buchanan and others who say that no sin is worst than another. That's poor theology. What's true is that all but one sin is forgivable at the cross. Only blaspheme against the Holy Spirit is unforgiveable.Jesus Christ paid for that punishment, but He didn't nullify it's weight of sinfulness. We escape God's wrath by first repenting, and secondly, accepting His atonement, and lastly, living rightly in God's eye's alone, henceforth.Read your bible and stop listening to deceitful men. Jesus promises that all those who sincerely seek the real truth, and who do so with God alone as their source of truth, shall find it. Men(including me) are short sighted and don't hold all truth, we need to seek it from God alone and He will only do it through Jesus Christ (The Word made flesh).Seek verses like, John 8:34, Matt. 5:17-20, Gal. 3:22-24, John 8:34, Rom. 6:6, Luke 9:56 "	AGAINST

1320	gayRights	"We need to also remember a couple of important things about passages from any Bible.  First, even if they WERE Divinely inspired, they've been translated many times over thousands of years.  So you have mistakes, misinterpretations, and even the infusion of personal opinion.  Think about this...1000 years from now if someone attempts to translate an English document, they may not realize that the words ""man,"" ""men,"" and even ""mankind"" have traditionally referred to all human beings regardless of gender.  Think about the misinterpretations that would create in translation.Second, and this is important... the Bible was written during times when human beings weren't as enlightened and educated as they are now.  People didn't understand the underlying psychology and science of metaphysics.  So Bibles were written to cater to those more ignorant times.  They are full of allegories and simplistic rules and laws in order to control behavior during times when reason wasn't as evolved.  So anyone who still views these simplistic and modified writings as the ultimate law of human behavior, is still living in ignorance.  Two more comments:  1.  If someone is going to quote the Bible as a guide to behavior, then they need to take heed of the entire teachings of the Bible, including the admonishment to NOT JUDGE others.  If you're going to quote the Bible, you lose all credibility if you pass judgement on another person....you're immediately refuting yourself and you look ignorant and foolish.  If you truly understand and adopt the teachings as a GUIDE to living, then you will never utter a word against another human being, but instead take care to treat others with compassion and respect.  Those of you who quote portions of the Bible out of context of the entire missive (if you believe it to be such) are showing ignorance.2.  Any credible psychologist knows that people often speak up against and condemn things that they don't like within themselves.  Almost all homophobic opinions and behavior stem from the speaker's difficulty accepting those feelings within themselves.  Homophobic behavior simply reveals a lack of adjustment to homosexual inclinations."	FAVOR

You then go on to say- ""The higot feels they are deserving of special treatment by the whole of society because they just do,period."" - Um...or maybe they feel that they are deserving of not special, but EQUAL treatment because the Declaration of Independence says ""all men are created equal"" and the 14th amendment guarantees equal protection under the laws of this country. I guess that is the same as ""just because."" Right? Further, you argue that a higot is- ""A person who does not see tolerance as something they must exhibit but that all others must abide by these cosmic rules;a sense of distorted reality aka homosexual bigot=higot."" So... you don't exhibit tolerance to homosexuals...but you think that they, as part of all others, should tolerate/abide by the laws proclaiming the sanctity of heterosexual marriage, protection of your god, etc. Right? - So then, aren't you calling yourself a higot? It seems as though the person suffering from a distorted reality is you. By the way, I know many homosexuals who are more than tolerant that I am a heterosexual female. You also say that a higot is- ""A person who will when they are questioned about their sexual choice will deny the ability to choose or willingness to admit they can change. Despite horrendous mounting evidence to the contrary."" If leading a heterosexual lifestyle is uncomfortable to a homosexual person, why should they change?

Speaking of Rock Hudson you say- ""They will say they are born this way and have no choice but deny the fact that people like Rock Hodson would be alive today since his first choice was a woman""- Were you personal friends with Rock? Did he tell you that his first choice was a woman? Did you ever think that he married a woman to protect his career from bigots like yourself? I suspect that is more likely what happened. You say- ""They will question the authenticity of someones homosexuality if they do anything illegal or immoral ie serial rapist/murderers that are homosexual are not true homosexuals according to them."" - Um...don't ""straight"" men distance themselves from other ""straight"" men who are serial rapists/murderers? That's ok right? ""They feel that homosexuality cannot be taught or learned but is a birth condition, without any genetic proof of course."" - Last time I checked, there is no solid proof of god, so you better not be believing in him either, because there is no solid proof. I am sure even if studies came out proving that homosexuality was genetic, you would find a reason not to believe it, just like   evolution  .You then go on to say- ""teaching homosexuality to   children   in school."" Umm...more like teaching TOLERANCE at school. Tolerance to accept others that are different than you. Maybe you need to go back to school, because you are clearly deficient in this area. You close with: ""We should, and dare I say must, be careful when it comes to the fact our children are being hurt by this misguided and dangerous sexual movement."" - I respond that we should, and dare I say must, be careful when it comes to the fact that our children are being hurt by this misguided and dangerous bigotry.

On your line of reasoning, inter-racial marrying, which was of course legally barred for decades, would automatically be justified. We must challenge these assumptions to see if they hold water today. Considered more systematically however, if you were to go to church and marry without seeking the approval and consent of the state, your marriage wouldn't be legally valid. The inverse, however, isn't true: If you are given a contract by the state to marry without seeking the consent of a religious affiliation your marriage is still valid.

The mere fact of equal application does not mean that our analysis of these statutes should follow the approach we have taken in cases involving no racial discrimination where the Equal Protection Clause has been arrayed against a statute discriminating between the kinds of advertising which may be displayed on trucks in New York City, Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New York, 336 U.S. 106 (1949), or an exemption in Ohio's ad valorem tax for merchandise owned by a nonresident in a storage warehouse, Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U.S. 522 (1959)....  In the case at bar, however, we deal with statutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of equal application does not immunize the state from the very heavy burden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race.""In other words, miscegenation laws were not ""equal protection"" even though both races were punished equally for entering an interracial marriage.  Similarly, DOMAs are not ""equal protection"" even though both genders are punished equally for entering a same-sex marriage because there can be said to be an invidious gender-based discrimination.  The test, then, is whether there is a ""rational"" basis for same-sex couples not to get married, which I contend that there is not.Or perhaps people wanting to engage in same-sex marriages should just put up and shut up with how they are already treated?

Perhaps it is time they no longer are able to do so as an elite set of human beings with their liberty purchased at the expense of denying such liberty to others.The liberty of legal marriage reserved for man-woman couples is elitism. It has little to no respect for the higher value of individual rights and mutual liberty. There is no righeousness in in denying homosexuals the liberty to marry whomever or as many as they choose in the pursuit of personal happiness.As for redefining ""marriage"", perhaps we ought not limit ourselves to the very narrow special-interest definition of the major religions.

1339	god	"Well first, since you are the one talking about a greater good, it would be nice to start with a definition or examples of a greater good. In my conception of a greater good I am assuming this means to uphold certain values, such as truthfulness, and thus I put this as an example. Sorry if that was not clear, perhaps you can clarify, what the greater good is and how we can identify what it is. Also, when you say that we shouldn't bring religion into the debate you must first explain why on your introduction to the debate you have us imagine that we are creating a religion. We should first agree on whether or not religion is an obligatory vehicle for a belief in God. It seems to me that in your argument followers of a god want to find ways to please this god, and thus will be compelled to follow rules. People can either then follow established religions or create personal ""guidelines"" and ""rules"" of their own, and this becomes their religion. What benefit can there be to society where people are creating their own guidelines to follow based on a subjective understanding of a God? Some people may say my god requires me to dance naked in the middle of the street and then... what is the benefit to society? Either way, as you say, without bringing religion into the question (or pretending to create a religion), there are many people out there, agnostics for example, who do believe in a creator but not necessarily some creator who wants anything from them... a god that is more of a passive uninvolved observer, than a ruler. These people thus, have no need to ""please"" him or follow ""his"" rules. And it doesnt mean that they people are lawless savages. The ability to understand what is good and bad for society, as I have mentioned before, has nothing to do with the belief in having a god to please or fear. A lot of people claim to believe in the possibility of a god, and yet not be religious, since the god they contemplate is one who doesn't provide systematized rules. The systematized rules that you mention, come from religion, NOT a belief in god. May I ask you why you believe that people are not able to figure things out on their own? You say that religion should not take the blame for a lot of the ills in society, but look how far religion has come and yet it doesn't seem we are learning how to get along. Maybe it is time to let people figure things out, and see what happens instead of getting stuck in the idea that people need some mythical being to tell them what to do."	AGAINST

The Bible at times simply defies all logic, science and life as we know it. You can argue about religion and science. But science makes the componants of existance and what has actually happened. So the science is 100% correct and you can not modify this in its complete state. We are mostly talking about the Christian God but what about others? Muslim god Allah and others? Do they exist too? So which God made the world and created life? 3 solutions here. Either only one exists making all but one religion true. Non of them exist making all of them false or all gods are one also making all reliigions false. Whichever way the majority of belief is flawed and contradicted through other religions. Who says the Bible is fact and the Quaran is false?God has supposedly created life and brought a beautiful world upon us. He has the power to do anything. Why has he not done any of these so called miracles in our life like turning water into wine etc. The world of today is a sorry state, with murders, diseases and even terrorists.

At least you're responding to this argument.Other than the Bible, what evidence is there that Christianity is the ""right"" religion? And since when is the Bible a historical book? There is no historical evidence of Jesus existing, therefore Christianity must be based completely on faith (as it is with most religions). In addition, I'm curious to hear what evidence you claim backs up the Bible. As for reason... well as I said I'm very interested to hear this.As for your simplistic descriptions of the world's religions, I find myself in an unusual position... arguing with a theist about the legitimacy of religion, from the point of view of religion. You clearly feel a very personal connection with your own God, however, you deny that that same feeling can exist for anyone else. Can a Hindu not feel passion for his Gods? Is the love he feels for his Gods false?You claim that missionaries spread the word of God to nearly all cultures, but what about before that? What about the Native Americans who existed before the European conquerors? Were they sentenced to eternal damnation because of their ignorance? How about when the missionaries brought smallpox? Was this God's love?You also seem to talk about Christianity as if it's a single religion. How about all the different sects of Christianity? Methodists, Baptists, Mormons, Catholics, Quakers.... which is the right one? Are they all right?You seem to think that religion makes most people moral as well. Do not forget that segregation lasted longest in the ""Bible Belt,"" or that the KKK touts Christianity as one of it's principles. Or how about the group ""God hates fags""? Those guys are religious, and clearly assholes.Your view of the world is simplistic, and leaves very little room for other cultures and religions.

1346	god	"""This is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."" (Moses 1:39)If we come to know not only that God exists but who He is and what our potential is, it would put this small moment in eternity we call life in perspective.  Imagine a string pulled from New York to Las Angeles.  Now imagine a pin inserted in that string somewhere in the middle, say Nebraska.  That pin is to represent this earth life.  The possibility of eternal life back in our heavenly home is an ""actual implication"" and a very important one.    I am Christian and therefore, an ""actual implication"" is the importance of the vicarious sacrifice of Jesus Christ; the great and last sacrifice.  To me the existence of God is tied directly to Jesus Christ.  This is vitally important because of the next point.I personally think one reason in the doubt concerning our Heavenly Father's existence is his communication with man sometimes being overlooked.  Yes He could, in a booming voice, speak to all nations and there would be none left with excuse (believe it or not, that day is coming).  However, instead He calls Holy and True Prophets such as the ones we read of in the Holy Bible.  If He had ever called a Prophet, he will continue to call Prophets.  There is a true Prophet of God on earth today.  No, not the kind that mutter blabberings in downtown New York, or the kind that make people drink purple koolaid.  There are, and have been, many prophets that have led souls unto God and to His will; which is to trust in Him (in word, and ACTION [Faith]), to come to know His begotten son Jesus Christ, to repent (change, turn from sin or unjustice), to pray to Him, and follow the path that would lead back to His presence and to receive as a ""...joint heir with Christ...""  (Rom 8:16)The implication of Gods existence is this:  if we believe in God means we must allow Him to become involved in our lives, changing it, giving specific commandments, approving or disapproving. While He that believes not, keeps God distant; ""out of their Hair"".  Forget everything I've said, kneel down right now and ask God, our Heavenly Father, out loud, if he exists and what you'd do differently if He did.  I promise you that if you ask with Trust (you will act upon the answer He gives you), being sincere of Heart, He will answer you.  He did for me so clearly and far beyond sight that I am left with no doubt.  Thats the test; far better that seeking an answer from man.  Because those answers change; He remains constant.  If he does remain constant, thats another important implication for you.  Boy, do I get excited about this topic.  Just try the experiment, let God enter.     "	FAVOR

God is the matrix.  His son is the human embodiment of his power and has existed before creation, though he was born of a young woman 2000 years ago.A mystery, not so much, quantum theory now tells us that time is not as real as we percieve.  We know that matter can exist in many places at once.  So then it follows that man and God can do it as well.  Therefor God can be born in 3 AD, but have existed at creation.  In fact, creation, the birth and death of Christ, and the Revelation can occur simultaneously.What physcisist are trying to find is the ultimate cause, but the burning bush gave us that answer thousands of years ago in the desert.It is possible CERN may solve the riddle and yield the ""God"" particle and in doing so it may also open the door to heaven, ------it may be that in this time, God wants us to find him ------ again!"

Only showing His superiority to the police or law.Who is God? The Almighty, Benevolent, Omniscient etc. He is the most moral, righteous, loving, wise etc. He is perfection. That is God. God tells people to do out of love, nobility, righteousness etc. But he has also set the law. Because He is God, His law is right, so living by His word is right. We cannot decide what is right or wrong, as we all have different opinions of what is wrong or right. So if you are to say tread the noble path... wtf is the noble path? It's easy to say, but your noble path is completely different to my noble path and if everybodies noble path is different then there is only one being who can truly decide what is right and wrong as He is Right.

Darwin's stuff is still considered a theory, for instance.  It is not a fact.  Global warming, caused by human actions, is still a theory, not a fact.

I find that the ones I have read have common themes about loving the unlovable and generally buy into the same 10 commandments that are found in the old testament.  My issue with the other texts is that all of them, except The Bible, promise a way to heaven thru some kind of action by you, a mere mortal, no further action by God being required.  Only The Bible makes it clear that nobody gets to heaven unless God physically intervenes and allows it. That's the text I choose to believe since it requires the existence of God.

1364	god	No, for very simple reasons.There is no requirement for the intervention of a God to live a healthy lifestyle. We're capable of making our own decisions without knowing where life comes from, when and how the universe began, etc. And religions like Christianity attempt to reach into the realms of the unknown and not only fill this gap with definite answers, but it tells you not to do this or that and creates antagonistic behavior towards people like homosexuals, sexually active people, and people who drink or smoke pot. In other words, victimless crimes. Then it takes credit for basically the entire universe and people's natural tendency to grow and prosper. I don't see the benefit of following a cult that claims to know the intentions of an almighty creator.The atheistic countries of Europe have already worked this out amongst themselves. It took centuries of religious persecution and violence to create countries with the foremost standards of living, without religion. I live without it too, I don't hurt anybody, I help out, and any culture knows that the best way to approach life is to live happy and help others live happy. No commandments required.	AGAINST
1365	god	Really, the wager isn't a 50/50 bet.  What if you pick the wrong god, and the true god is a jealous spiteful one, and you have to face Zeus, for example, in the afterlife?  Might you be better off not believing in any god, rather than insulting god by believing in someone else?  It would be good if you could actually prove your god's existence, instead of relying on blind faith.  Or better still, if he could give a sign that no one would be able to dismiss.	AGAINST

1369	god	What you said is a little confusing	FAVOR
1370	god	"Yes, there can be no good without God. With out an author, everything then becomes a matter of personal preference and interpretation. There is no objective standard by which to judge things.I disagree. I don't have a god, and am quite an exceptional person if I do say so myself. My objective standard is 1. empathy, what I would like for myself given I were in another's situation - a perfectly natural, and completely human emotion which in no way depends on a creator. 2. what knowledge and empirical evidence has shown us to be the nature of the world in which we live - which again is in no way dependent on a creator.You can't ask the maker of the product how it should be used. It means man has no purpose for which he was made and therefore there can be no deviation from a norm.Which product has any god in the history of mankind shown how to use? And what is this purpose you speak of? I mean, everyone has their own ""purpose"" and the world hasn't ended in fire and brimstone thus far.But worse than that is if there is no life after death, then justice becomes a sham. Those who go on shooting sprees and then take their lives escape justice. Hitler escaped justice and got off.Or, if there is no life after death, life becomes even more important. I would submit that most every mass murderer in the history of the world had some belief in some god, so this entire statement is simply incorrect.But the worst thing is that our lives become pointless and without meaning or value. If we come from nothing and return to nothing, folks we are nothing. Our lives have no value. Then there is no difference between gassing termites and gassing 6 million Jews.Again, as one who does not believe in any god whatsoever, I can promise from experience that I still find plenty of points to continue living. And again, it makes those lives lost even more tragic as I'm pretty sure they're just dead, and not floating around somewhere as magical spirits.That ought to scare any sane person. Because then you become a commodity for the state to use and consume for it's purposes. There is a correlation between Communism and atheism. For further proof pick up a copy of The Guinness Book of World Records and check out the greatest mass murderers of all time: Atheistic regimes, Stalin, Mao etc etc. There is a reason Russia is experiencing a surge in religion. This question is not a theoretical one for them; they know the answer from first hand experience.That's just dumb. I am firmly against communism, as atheist as I am. Further, Hitler referred to himself as an Evangelical in his speeches on Mien Kempf. The crusades killed around 6 million people (5 million in the first four and another 1 million in the Albigensian Crusade.) Terrorism from the middle east is under the banner of religion, as is much of the ethnic cleansing in Africa. Of the two; god's hands are far bloodier than any atheist's. I do however think the greater question is why do we have to protect ourselves from ourselves. Take the Ten Commandments, it ought to stagger us that God has to tell us not to murder and steal. Wow!!Agreed. Did it ever occur to you that god had nothing to do with the ten commandments? But that some smart person said, ""these people are idiots, we need to figure out some way to control them."" This sounds more like an argument for education than against atheism.that ought to be a given. We shouldn't have to be told not to do those things. And then to be threatened with punishment knowing we will do those things.Agreed. And again, of the 18% of the human population that identifies them self as atheist or agnostic, you will find about the same proportion within that population as in the religious population who follow the relevant commandments such as don't kill and steal, all without the fear of eternal damnation.Something is amiss at the very core of who we are. Laws can't help us because as soon as they get in the way of what we want, they get broke. And it's painfully obvious religion can't help either; it just becomes a facade we hide behind to justify our actions. Others simply turn to atheism, they close their eyes, cross their fingers and hope no one is home in the universe and proceed to do what they want, when they want. Others still will try to plead ignorance: "" I really want to do this and If there is a God I'll just tell Him that I didn't know that it was wrong""So you're saying, it doesn't matter if someone believes in a god or not, they're going to do what they do. Agreed again, so how is this an argument for god being for the greater good? It would seem to be an argument for it not mattering... which happens to be a very atheist and free-thinking argument by the way. Odd... btw, I'm not crossing my fingers and hoping no one is home. That's a ridiculous view of atheism.Folks, we need to be saved from ourselves, we are the problem. And when you are lost in the forest the worst thing you can do is ask yourself for directions.When man began, we lived in caves, died when we were in our mid twenties of violence or hideous diseases, spent all of our time starving half to death, rape was the general family structure, we smelled bad and were exceedingly harry. Where was god then? That most have since our short advancement from that brutish existence, used religion in one way or another, it seems to me we've come this far quite on our own. Every advance in our existence, from medicine, to exploration of a round world (as opposed flat) has been fought by religion nail, tooth, stake in the ground, and fire."	AGAINST

1378	god	"There's a lot of historic evidence if you do some research: about 20 sites noted in the Bible have been excavated and confirmed in archeological digs, along with documentation from non-biblical resources from Greek and Roman historians of Jesus' existence. Just do some searching (they're too long to list here), but it's there.I don't deny at all people of other religions may very much believe in their faith. What I've said is, throughout numerous debates, is that I've done my homework from the time I was an atheist, studied the world religions and what other religions are missing is consistency in creation and faith and reason. I have not found this to be so with Christianity.That is an excellent question about the Native Americans. I am part Indian. As I said, God reveals himself to all in numerous ways. The Bible says ""all have sinned"" (Rom 3:23). Native Americans were involved in sinful practices long before the white man came along, as was the white man long before coming to America. Furthermore, Native culture is loaded with occult beliefs and practices, including the worship of rocks, trees and sky and of the spirits that allegedly live in these things: worship of the creation instead of the Creator. And if they could worship these things, they could have worshipped Him in faith. And many have and do today. But don't misunderstand: God needs to open our spirit to be able to respond to the gospel. There won't be a single person eternally separated from God (""damned"") who can say ""I really wanted to be saved but wasn't given the chance"". God is an all-knowing, loving and just God. Visit www.h-net.org/~west/threads/disc-smallpox.html  for further information on the possible smallpox spread by Europeans to Indians via infected blankets. Since I cannot possibly know for sure without having been there if the disease was spread intentionally by the white man to hurt Indians (there are differing accounts), I cannot judge whether Amherst's claim is true or not. But know this: God will not be fooled. Jesus did not come out of hate, but out of love. If people used His name to intentionally cause their suffering or deaths, they would be judged accordingly. Jesus says, ÒBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheepÕs clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I NEVER KNEW YOU: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.Ó (Matt 7:15-23).There are saved Protestants and unsaved Protestants, saved Catholics and unsaved Catholics, saved Baptists and unsaved Baptists, etc. (see above). All basically adhere to the Nicene Creed and respect and love one another. If a Christian's faith in God through the Nicene Creed's basic tenants is genuine, then they will see the face of God. If, according to the Bible, people add to the Bible or attempt to rewrite it or redefine its fundamental principles (of which most of the Christian denominations do agree on), then they do not actually believe in the God of the BibleÑthen they have created their own god (idolatry).One (just one) of Christianity's goals is to make people like Christ, who was, by all recorded accounts, the most moral person that ever walked the planet. However, as I've pointed out a number of times, man is fallen, and there is evil in the world. Christians are just as susceptible to it as non-believers. Please, please don't write off Christianity because of hate groups like the KuKluxKlan or Fred Phelps groupÑneither of whom understand the Gospel as displayed by their fruits. Writing authentic Christianity off because of horrible actions by groups like those is like saying some white men have murdered people, therefore all white men are murderers, or some black men robbed a grocery store, therefore all blacks are thieves. Which is obviously illogical and untrue. Those kinds of groups do not represent me or most Christians.I'm sorry you think my view of the world is simplistic. I don't condemn atheistsÑI once was one, but I was apparently drawn by the Spirit and realized that atheism was even more simplistic and without proof, and I am entitled to my beliefs as much as you are.I have answered your questions, but I'm pulling out for good. I got hurt last night by all the hateful responses, and God doesn't want that. He doesn't want me to be hurt or to hurt others in responseÑsome of my reactions, no matter what the provocation, weren't cool. I came to this site because I accidentally came across it one day and noticed many questions on God with replies that revealed many had been misinformed or incorrectly taught about Christianity. I've tried to directly answer the question of a debate as fairly and respectfully as I could, but it's become apparent that this site is more interested in hateful cyber-bullying rather than a respectful exchange of thoughts or follow the rules of fair debate. And if atheists read this and it makes them feel good about themselves to do that to someone or feel no shame, then I believe I've proved not only my point for leaving but for the need for God. But I encourage all the atheists on this site to keep asking questions (there's a reason ""Doubting"" Thomas was one of the twelve apostles!), but I would also advise listening and hearing others out with respect.

Morality becomes objective and factual, not subjective like most religions that impose rules and norms only because ""God says so"". Religious morality for example has been changing over time, proving that it is as subjective as any other type of opinion. the bible itself contains examples of the changes that occurr in the laws given to the people. At one point in time christians were not allowed to eat animals with hoofs, however this changed over time. We cannot base our concepts in books that change with the interpretations given to them.

1403	god	This depends on how far you believe the influence of a god goes. Did the god create the Universe and set up the laws of physics and then let nature take its course, or does he/she/it have an active involvement in everything with nothing going unnoticed or uninfluenced; or any position between these extremes.In the latter case, why create species and then destroy them (such as extinctions)? What is the reason for creating species that survive by killing and eating other species (that feel pain)? Why do we have diseases that cause so much suffering and what is the point of allowing humans to find cures for diseases that god created? In the former, science can not explain the causes of the Big Bang or the creation of life, but that does not mean there is not a scientific explanation. Many things that were once thought to be to work of god are now explained by science, such as earthquakes, plagues and eclipses. 1,000 years ago god would have been an adequate explanation of these events, but we now have other (scientific) explanations. The things that science has explained so far do not need the intervention or guidance of a god; therefore if there is a scientific explanation of the creation of the world it will probably not need a god either. If there is no god there is no reason (ie nothing is planned or meant to happen). Just because science can not explain something now does not necessarily mean we never will be able to understand it. I feel a little uncomfortable saying that because something is extremely complicated and we donÕt understand it, it must be attributed to a god.

We cannot see him, touch him, etc. Therefore, we must observe indirect evidence of his existence. Unfortunately, there is none. The only ""evidence"" religious people use is attempting to DISPROVE the big bang, evolution, etc -- not PROVE that THEIR side is correct. Why? Because they have no evidence. No archaeological evidence for a Garden of Eden, no direct link between prayer and healing, etc. Suppose there is a god. For something to exist, it or evidence for it must be observable.

Does Pluto seem to have a special function, or serve a special purpose for human life? What about a random planet millions of light years away? Do you think that it serves mankind? It's a selfish and stupid idea, if so. Would your god be happy to know that you're so full of yourself to assume that everything in existence is FOR you? Earth is nothing more than a combination of over-abundant material. Why aren't there more planets like earth then!? Think about it this way, when the lights are off in your room at night do you know that there isn't someone being murdered in Japan? We don't have the means to tell if there are planets capable of supporting life, but there are more planets in our solar system, more solar systems in the galaxy and more galaxies in the universe, and maybe more universes... in the multiverse. There are the same materials all over the place that we can find here on earth, so what's to keep you from assuming that earth is not the only planet like this in ALL OF EXISTENCE!? You probably don't even know what happened in the 1500's, but you seem to know that there has been nothing like earth, ever, in all of time and in the extreme vastness of space... and then on top of that your planet is the only to support life ever, and then on top of that even, you are 1 out of 498390485038453840589 of the most intelligent beings EVER.

1420	god	  pbeaird, indeed. That is no argument from ignoracne but one acknowledging all the failed arguments for God in line with the auto-epistemic rule.   The presumption of naturalism reflects that not only are natural causes and explanations efficient but also necessary, primary and sufficient. They, contrary to Gottfried Wilhem Leibniz, are the sufficient reason.  This neither sanbags theist nor begs the question but demands evidence as Einstein so did to overcome Newton.  Science explains the how and the why. The why is not according to a pre-arranged plan [ the atelic challenge] but according to natural forces, including those random ones. So those are indeed primary causes; one cannot then declare God the primary cause and them the secondary ones. As our naturalist arguments are defeasible, then there is probably no God.	FAVOR

1422	god	"Kinda, A warped sense of ""reality"" comes from religious dogmas that teach us to follow fairy tales and trust imaginary beings such as god, or else we go to hell. I support a clear, objective understanding of reality, you clearly don't. You are still hoping that the god you believe in is real in order to base your morality on it. Morality does not require a god. Atheists are not immoral people. Muslims are not immoral people. Buddhist are not immoral. Everyone is capable of understanding and exercising good will towards others (in favor of a greater good), with or without a religious background. What I'm saying is, there is no need to believe in god in order to attain a greater good. I still maintain that arguing which religion is right is absurd because it is like arguing about the preferences of santa claus. It is unnecessary. A waste of effort. And unfortunately it further divides us. I know people clash on different subjects, we all have differences.. however religious people tend to view others outside their religion as being inferior, or condemned, or in need. They view themselves as being ""right"" and this hinders communication and dialogue. While two people with differing opinions on politics or philosophy an argue and change their minds and grow; two very firm religious believers will not argue for the sake of developing their ideas. Their aim is to ""convince"" the other person that they need a ""god"". Im very clear in saying that moral choices do not come from fairy tales. They come from judgement based on enough evidence about a situation. When two friends of yours get into a fight and one comes to tell you about the situation, you have the choice to make a judgement without listening to the other side of the story. If you do, your judgement is more likely to be flawed than if you allowed yourself to listen to the other side. The more evidence you have, the better the choice you will make. Religion makes us listen to only one authorative voice, the voice of god (whoever that one is). When I talk about ""evidence"" please do not mistake this only with scientific evidence. When I speak of science I mean using the scientific method of inquiry. Of course moral judgments come outside of science! im not arguing or that or saying contrary. But INFORMED judgments come from more evidence and knowledge. Thats the difference. When I hear ""homosexuality is wrong!"" from a religious person, no one is able to give me one reason between stuttering that doesn't boil down to ""the word of god"". This is an exampled of a moral judgement that is uninformed and inaccurate. I find a lot of contradictions in what you are saying about belief in god. When I mentioned that faith is the certainty of things without the need for evidence, Im not making this up. Go look at the definition of faith in the bible and you will see what many followers already know. Questioning within a religion is not ""wrong"" but it is seeing often as an attack of the devil, a phase, or something that must be overcome. Because eventually, you just gotta believe, brother. or as you mentioned near the end of your post: you just have to trust the imaginary being above. When you say that science does nothing, you sound like a very religious uneducated person. Science does nothing?! geez, now who sounds close minded? A scientific method of reasoning actually tells us to start all inquiries with the premise that we do not know, and thus, we keep on searching. Religious people quit that search and take things by faith, that is, by lack of evidence. Including a lack of proof for the existence of god. If you show an atheist proofs of the existence of god, then it makes sense to believe. But when scientific proof comes out rebutting the possibility of the afterlife, or miracles, or of resurrection , the religious person closes his ears and stops listening. This also occurs when two religious people argue, from different beliefs... why? because they already trust ""in their heart"" so no point in dialoguing in order to find out if what they trust is true or not. Judgement about whether one thing is good or not should come from information. Lets stop calling it science cause you seem to get confuse. In your example about immigration, if your judgement is based on the unfounded belief that people from other countries are inferior, then your judgement will be wrong. However if you judgement is based upon evidence about the effects of immigration on your country (whether good or bad), then you will have a better judgement, and therefore make better laws. Does that make sense? What is the need for a god ideology when in reality better judgement comes from more information? So isn't evidence useful?!? I find it appalling to be arguing with someone who says that science has done nothing, and who sees no point in gathering evidence before making a judgement about a person or a behavior. Religion gives a warped sense of reality. Evidence clears out our warped senses and presents reality in a sharper focus."	AGAINST

1425	god	  That law, the conservation of mass-energy exhibits itself in two ways: one, therefore their cannot be absolute contingency- no Esistence -as the contingency argument so requires;two, it exhibits itself in quantum energy, whence comes matter-energy. So here, science indeed does exhibit no reason to posit a dvine creator   Science finds no cosmic teleology- no preordained plans for events in Existence. Thus arises the atelic argument that therefore one cannot posit God as behind events.    To posit God as somehow involved would be the new Omphalos argument that God hides Himself as the epistemic distance argument would endorse in effect. John  L. Schellenberg observes that that distance reflects His hiddenness so much that He probably doesn't exist!	FAVOR

The fact is, the meaning of a thing is individually determined. Without point of view, there is no meaning.Meaning and the word ""meaning"" are human invention.One must and can only act from one's own point of view in specific context.

1427	god	I do believe there is a higher power that most people would refer to as God.  My Interpretation stems from intelligence and how we understand the world around us and then to the higher levels of intelligences.  For example my dog is a wonderful pet, but he does have a lower intelligence than me.  He experiences the world very differently than me.  Am I a God to him? I think to him we would be.  If we didn't know better if a alien race came down to this planet and had intelligence that we did not understand would they be a God? In ancient history probably yes, watch Chariots of Fire. Nowadays thats a tough one, we have a much better understanding of what intelligence is.  If God walked the earth would he cease to be God?  I think it boils down to intelligence and the authority that intelligence perceives to have. Last thought intelligence a entity born out of energy derived from a source called GOD.  We all possess a piece of it, that we have to grow to return back to the source.	FAVOR

In the case of Zeus and the unicorn this evidence is lacking.  We are quite happy to accept that such lack of evidence is sufficient for us to dismiss the existence of Thor and fairies.  Logically we should take the same lack of positive evidence to dismiss the existence of Allah and the Christian God as well."	FAVOR
1429	god	"You asked a couple of good questions.  Let's see if I can give you some good answers. First, regarding conviction and belief. You wrote: ""Right now I sit in a chair, convinced it will hold me up. I've never studied a chair I don't know exactly why or how long chairs will hold people up, but I believe that I am safe. So I think that conviction and belief are closer and strongly related than you might suppose.""   It's quite okay to say that you ""believe"" a chair will hold you up. Most of our convictions are subconscious evaluations formed many years ago and they've become automatized. We've had countless experiences since childhood that when we can sit in a chair it will hold us up. From those experiences we've formed evaluations which in time have become firm convictions.  It's okay to use the term ""believe"" in this manner. It's not precise, but most people know what you mean. In everyday talk, we often use the two concepts interchangeably. However, in serious discussions I like to be more precise simply because to do so usually results in easier and quicker mutual understanding.But the two concepts are very different, for the reason I previously stated. In a serious discussion we make ourselves almost instantly understandable by your saying, for example, you believe in God and for me to say I am convinced God does not exist. The bonus in this is that we both see we have different viewpoints---or as is said these days, ""we know where the other is coming from."" Were each of us to use the same term, confusion would immediately result. And it would take us several hours, maybe days, to sort out what each mean. Your reference to bungee jumping is pretty much the same idea but using a different example. Many people go through their entire lives wishing things were so, or believing something is safe. That does not alter the nature of the intellectual methodology of belief and its distinct difference from conviction.   The other question you asked was: ""What would you define as true happiness?""  Novelist/philosopher Ayn Rand wrote: ""Happiness is the successful state of life, pain is an agent of death.  Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one's values.""  This must be understood in the context of her philosophy, Objectivism.  Miss Rand is referring to values that are in accordance with man's rational nature, fundamental values such as reason, purpose and self-esteem from which other values such as the choice of one's career, the type of art one enjoys, the qualities of character one esteems in others, and so forth.  She is NOT referring to those who claim a ""value"" in taking mind-destroying drugs, or sexual promiscuity or hedonism.  If one holds values in accordance with man's rational nature and seeks to achieve them, when one does so, one certainly experiences a state of happiness.  For example, say you want very much to find a life-partner. You think about what you want in a partner. You don't sit at home and mope. You go out and look around and meet different people and find what you want or something very close to it and you become friends with that person.  Surely you've achieved a value.  And surely that achievement will make you happy. I mentioned that achieving happiness begins with rejecting a religious moral code. You wrote: ""For my religion (Christianity) that would mean rejecting love, obedience to authority, unselfishness, etc. Good things in my opinion, and yours too I would think.""I think love is very good. I also think that love is not possible for those who believe in God.  I think that those who value love as you say you do, do so on my code of values, not on the Christian code of values.  I think ""obedience to authority and unselfishness"" are very bad things.  I think both are mind-destroying and spiritual suicide. Many Americans have a mixed set of values. One set of values is based on a rational code of morality that they've never discovered. Another set of their values are based on Christianity, which continuously erodes their rational code of morality.  Ayn Rand has identified the rational code of morality.  It is a code of morality based on man's nature as a basically good and valuable entity, with a rational faculty that can be his most glorious asset, if he chooses to use it.I cannot promise you to read Mere Christianity. I've read many books on Christianity and the other religions of the world.I'm delighted to hear that you will read Ayn Rand's novels, particularly Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead. "	AGAINST

1451	god	The point of previous post was not to present valid arguments. My sophistries are, obviously, designed to be absurd. Thing is, they aren't a great deal different than your arguments, which you claim to take seriously.It's possible to make sense out of the notion of an omnipotent deity--Aquinas did so--but Aquinas could provide a philosophical context in which omnipotence made sense. Now there have to be very few folks left, including religious folks, who seriously accept the mix of Neoplatonic and Aristotelian ideas that gave traditional theological ideas their cogency. It's not that anybody is trying to diss the great theologians of the Middle Ages. I respect them very much myself and have spent many years admiring them, in part for their sheer technical virtuosity. It is quite impossible, at least for me, to credit their universe of discourse, however. The God game, at least the traditional version of the God game, is over. Which, naturally, doesn't mean that you can't make money selling it on television.Absent an appropriate philosophical setting, omnipotence is an empty word. Or doesn't claiming that God and human are ontologically different commit you to having an ontology? What sort of being is a god? And if, in your utterly inadequate human ignorance, you can't tell me what you're talking about, why are you presuming to talk at all about something which, for all you know, is my uncle's pocket watch. (Don't tell me that it doesn't make sense that a pocket watch could save souls. Maybe that's just another one of those mysteries of the faith.)It's not that I'm so enthusiastic about my own ontological status, by the way. Indeed, one of the many things I find absurd about Christianity (and Islam, for that matter) is the absurd credit they give to humanity, as if the maker of heaven and earth had any reason to become man--the Islamic version of this vanity is that Satan fell out of resentment for the grand destiny that Allah had apportioned to human beings. Well, long ago a man named Xenophanes remarked that if asses had gods, they'd have long ears...   	AGAINST

Now what is a Spirit and why is that word capitolized? The book is putting emphasis on the word ""Spirit"". Does that say God is a man? No. It says God is a Spirit. What is the definition of the word spirit? It is the thinking, feeling, motivating part of man. Spirits or feelings motivate us to do certain things. Again, the Bible says that ""God IS love"".

1459	god	                                                        29 May 2009 I like what you had to say about God. What you need to understand is that many people really do not want to know the truth because it would require them to do some soul searching of their own. It is easier to blame God for the ills of the world than to research one's soul and take a good hard look at ourselves. How could there be good w/o bad, right w/o wrong, life w/o death? Remember whenever we become full of ourselves we open the door to true evil, Satan. God wants us to love him because we want to, not because we have to, ie free will. In today's   society   too much importance is put on   money   and material things in my humble opinion.  There are people who do not consider themselves poor, although by others standards most likely would be considered poor. If you believe in God, you must also know that Satan is his rival, and will do what it takes to attempt to dehumanize humans in the eyes of other humans. God won't fall for it however many humans will and do. I believe that there are millions of tragedies in this world that could be easily laid at Satan's door. He loves to see people ponder over whether there is a God, it is his mission. We do have choices in this world, whether or not people see that have choices or not is another story. To simply do nothing is a choice, and if Satan can keep us reacting instead of acting, he has us on the fence post. For me God does exist because when I look back over my life, and I see the many times God was there for me when no one else was. It would not have mattered if I had a lot or money or none, because I was in the hospital on machine that was breathing for me. They were pumping me full of morphine/paralytic drugs so I would remain still because I was told I was fighting the machine to breath on my own. It took me 3 months to be able to get my arms, legs, and hands to function properly. I remember walking around in Walmart for 3 hours trying to gain strengh in my legs.  The wonder of it all was I didn't remember hardly any of it, until I was told. What I remembered was praying in a safe place within myself. I saw my life and my loved ones lives and how much I loved them. I spoke with a woman whom I'm told no one ever saw in my room, yet she was with me all the time. I saw good times and sad times, and things I could have done differently in my past, and a chance to do them differently in the future. I saw violence and dispair and death whirl around me yet I was not afraid. It is okay with me if others choose to believe God does not exist, probably wouldn't be able to change their minds no matter what I said. I could have easily died in that hospital, but God had other plans, my daughter and my grandchildren needed me to be here for them, which I am. I am with my family, and to me that is worth more than any dollar value. We are not rich, we are not poor, however that is in terms of dollars and cents, we are rich in many other ways. I hope that what I have shared with you will make you think back over your lives, wonder what you might find. Thank you for reading my missive, it is longer than I had planned it to be.     Sincerely lfschrawyer 	FAVOR
1460	god	every time we try to assign to god some specific act, science comes along and shows plausible ways it could happen without god. The Miller Urey experiments of the 1950s showed you could take elements present in the early stages of earth and apply electricity to simulate static electricity/lightning - the result was amino acids and oganic compounds. the fact that inorganic can turn into organic and that better and more complex beings can come from lesser beings are both easily observable and all that is necessary for evolution to explain our existence.

Also, I don't understand your story- did you shoot blanks at them? What sort of sixteen year old were you, with three previous assaults? A violent lunatic? Also, two sons at sixteen? Huh, that sounds quite chaste to me. And if homosexuals said to you that you had no rights, wanted to stone you, etc., then you would be angry. You're angry for far less. Being gay doesn't make you a god-hater, nor does being straight make you a Christian. Acceptance is important, and you seem to be really, really short on that trait!Intolerance is hurting others for their beliefs.

1468	god	This is a great argument, so I marked you up, even though some idiot decided to mark you down...BUT the problem is that you're still putting MAN's mistakes as God's discredit. You're right that it is the belief in God that some of these things occur, but then again that can be applied to anything anybody strongly believes in. Take football in England... and how 'hooligans' go about it... the fights, friendships, groups etc. (You've seen Greenstreet right?) People fight, go extreme, argue etc. over DIFFERENCES, PERCEPTIONS, INTOLERANCE, IGNORANCE etc.The thing about having no God and having people think for themselves is that each and everysingly person's mentality and moral coding will be different to their neighbour's and imo that will bring about more destruction than having a God even in today's world.My point is that having God, without abusing 'Him', would create a better mentality for people than those who do not follow God.

He also knew that we would suffer for the sins of our fathers and our fellow souls.We can not see the entirity of our existence, for example when my nephew was killed in Iraq, it was an incredible sadness, but now four years later we appreciate the fullness of his life and the splendidness of his sacrifice. He gave up his earthly life to save others in his battalion.

1475	god	I'm an atheist - always have been, always will be. Most people don't change sides once they've come to a decision. So my comment is really about the nature of the argument. I'm weary of believers saying that evolution isn't true, or that they see god when they look at children. Even if there were merit to any of it, it's no basis for the existence of god. Nor is evolution's truth a basis for the absense of God. Can't we dispense with this silliness? Neither side can win the argument, because neither can answer the first and foremost question of being: Why is there something instead of nothing? I believe in the Big Bang Theory, but even that doesn't answer the question. My biggest argument against god so far is that religious people came up with him - the same people who have been denying scientific progress for hundreds of years. But both science and religion come from a human need to seek order and truth. So far science has won the battle but not the war.	AGAINST

1477	god	Objection number 1:Didn't say you couldn't be good only that you can't account for it, it's the grounding question. You can't account for good or evil in a purely naturalistic world. Those are moral judgments and making moral judgments is not a characteristic of matter. Hence the saying. dumb as a box of rocksObjection 2:When you make something it's usually for a purpose you have in mind, even if it's just to amuse yourself, there is a reason why you do it. If Intelligent Design is correct it would be wise to find out for what purpose we were createdObjection 3:Explain to me then how justice is established?For the record; Atheistic regimes have slaughtered upwards of 100 million people. All other atrocities combined don't even come close. But don't take my word for it. check the records. Ideas have consequences and Darwin's produced the bloodiest century in human history. And Darwin's theory was atheistic to the core.Objection 4:Again, you most certainly can, but you can't ground it.Objection 5:See the answer to objection 3 and go look up the greatest mass murderers in the Guinness Book of World Records.Objection 6:The evidence doesn't support your assertion. Objection 7: I was driving at the point that we even violate each other. that we do it at all is the greater problem. But again you can't account for Good or evil, Those are moral judgments and making moral judgments is not a characteristic of matter. Objection 8If there is a God, then we have hope. Because when you have been caught in the rip tide and you're drowning, you don't save yourself. And unless someone jumps into rescue you, you are as good as dead. In atheism, there is no lifeguard and no one on shore, you are all alone. In Christianity the lifeguard is on duty and He is able to save and He does. How differently will you live your life once you have been taken out of the mouth of death as it swallowed you ?In what do you have hope? and not the wishful thinking kind, that does no one any good. The confident certain kind that you can stand on.About crossing fingers. Take the time to read Pascal's Wager. I think the way I characterized atheism is pretty accurate. The smart money is on Jesus.Objection 9: You presuppose the descent of Man and then use that paradigm to interpret the facts. Might I suggest there might be another way to account for religion. The trouble with your explanation is that it is far to simple and fails to account for a great deal of factors; such as the reality that men don't event things far for terrible than what they know. The idea is always to appease the gods, aka forces of nature, you don't make something up vastly superior to the natural world.And again you mis-characterize history.	FAVOR

Maybe we should all be agnostics...we simply do not know nor will we ever know.	FAVOR
1483	god	See the problem here is we're going in circles. I've already said inherintly people are good in general and naturally know what is wrong and right and religion tends to go side by side with that. I'm not saying it's because of religion, but that they're intwined. I've also said (maybe not on this debate) that it's wrong when people do things without questioning - however it doesn't mean you always and continously question everything.You cannot use scientific method unless you already have a moral view. Science gives us some of the harms of using drugs, however it is upto us whether or not that is good or bad. Science says that drugs do blah blah to your body and mind. It gives statistics linking drug abuse to crime. It is people that say it's wrong. Science cannot say whether it is good or not for society to have crime etc. It can say that drug abuse affects the country in this or that way... but it cannot say it is wrong.I've stated that we'll never understand the full extent of our actions and even if we understand some of them.. is it truly right? Science itself is continously debating itself. Before you could hit your kids, then we're taught not to... and now there's growing debate that you should hit your kids (not abuse.. hit). This is science. We always think we know what we're doing and we know the results of our actions, however we don't and there's no way of telling. Look at the core of all the religions and tell me whether or not they are harmful to you or others around you.Even worse is the fact that again you're this example of this pastor as something against religion. Where in the Bible does it say go kill the abortionist? Would the majority of people condemn his actions? Was it truly in the name of God or was it through frustration and anger?People who do these things - Drug dealers, murderers, (maybe homos), gangsters etc. They ALL know what they're doing is wrong. All of them. (Unless they've got a mental issue). That pastor knows what he's done is wrong... but will defend himself nontheless. He will say that killing the doctor is a step towards stopping abortions, however he knows that killing a man is wrong. All of these people know what they do is wrong, but do it anyway and most of them say they're religious but do not follow the religion. When I drink alcohol, I know it's not right. It doesn't bother me... but I know that I don't need to, have to etc... but I do.. for my own selfish reasons. It's not something that bugs me.. it's just something small that I know I shouldn't do. Same as people who smoke... they know they shouldn't smoke, but they do. Atheists smoke... technically according to you, they shouldn't because they know the harm it does to them and because they use scientific reasoning objectively, they wouldn't smoke. They do. Same as theists.It's hard for me to explain other religious communities accurately because I haven't lived in them.. but my own. Relgion IS subjective and you keep missing that. The priests teach/lecture/explain the philosophy of the religion, that is their purpose.I really wonder how God is speaking to all these people directly in ways that contradict each other.That's an argument for which religion is right.

We could also believe to live on a toe nail of a really big giant (guess what the score on a debate with that statement would be...). There is no god unless we have strong indications or proof which we don't so there is no reason to think that this statement is true.

1498	god	We have actual knowledge about how animals came to be and why they show the behaviors they do, especially in relation to reproduction. We also have apparently reliable knowledge of the mechanism of heredity. That contrasts strongly with theological arguments that depend for their rhetorical strength on appealing to the prejudices and ignorance of the Many. Indeed, the Rabbi doesn't suggest anything at all explanatory.  In real explanations, one doesn't just say that something came to be with x attribute because it was produced by an agent with the same attribute. That's like arguing that green things are green because they are composed of little green things. Similarly, claiming that man is as he is because he was created by a man-like God doesn't really explain anything; and the Rabbi's reverse move of claiming that the behavior of men allows us to infer the characteristics of God is even more of a stretch. Of course the scientific explanation for the evolution of parental behavior may be in error. On the other hand, there is at least real evidence for it; and, if it is true, it is an actual explanation instead of an exercise in question begging.   	AGAINST

You should just be a good person.You don't need a god to have the ability to be a responsible, loving, and caring person. If you think that, you're lost. I understand everything you are saying perfectly. You do not understand me.	AGAINST

I am rather embarrased of the ignorance of men. Anyways, this has to be the most silly question in history-if you're educated and have any sense of moral sense you would agree. If the world wasn't created by the Supreme Being (GOD), than how else would it have gotten here. If any one person (or organization) expect me to ever believe that Earth one day just decided to appear in space and isolate the water from land and create it's own self a moon and set the sun impeccably in it's place and everything revolve and correlate in it's proper manner every morning-day-season-year etc.,, Than they are the most foolish, silly alive. There is but one explaination of the being of Earth and that's through Jesus Chridst himself. I am not typing this to reprimand, discourage or convert but simply to make a ""common sensed"" point to any and all readers that come across this comment. As the literary C.S. Lewis once said, ""You either believe in God or don't... "" He himself gave numerous reasons as to the reason that God does exist and how He is the creator of all things living and non living; dead and alive. Just a simple point to leave you with: If God didn't create the world and everything in it, then who did?

I agree with what you say about common sense. and in that video you clearly saw how common sense is being lost. About your fear of loosing morals to ""freedom"" which comes from a scientific understanding, I ask you... what is so bad about that? Why do you see it as some dooming scenario? So what if your neighbor likes to fuck a dog? As long as we can prove that nor him or the dog are getting diseases, how is this making the world BAD? what are the negatives of that ? .... seriously.... I think all the negatives you see come from a ""desirable"" image of the world that is imposed by religion.... For me, a desirable world comes from people respecting other people's view, not looking down upon them because they have different preferences, and where people are free to do what they want as long as they dont harm each other. Isn't that the tenet of most religions anyway? love thy neighbor ?When I agree that alcohol is bad, Im not agreeing with god's word, Im agreeing with medical evidence about what it does to the body... And I agree that a world without alcohol is better, but as long as you are inflicting the harm only upon yourself, I have nothing to complain about. So tell me, why do you see zoophilia as negative? what is so bad about that? ... (use it as an example of the downward spiral in the world) I think you will not be able to prove it, without using your own subjective ""morality"". All I m saying is that we need to think criticaly about where our morals come from and religion is not a good source for moral standards. Below is a video of the source for ""good doing"" for religious people: the fear of going to hell. How can such a story be a source for ""morality""?

1520	god	"I think you will be hard-pressed to find a religion that is as tolerant and flexible as you say. Religions are built around infallible ""gods"", and therefore must stick to whatever they say at their conception in order to maintain validity. Religions cant change without contradicting their previous statements of infallibility. Look at how hard the Catholic Church fought to stop Galileo's ideas about celestial bodies, and how hard modern Christian organizations are fighting to teach creationism and dispute evolution. If they changed, the would go against everything they were told in their bibles.I didnt mean to offend you with my Hitler reference. I'm sure you're not a fascist or mass murderer, i just wanted to show where that argument can lead. My point is that change, and the ability to cope and embrace it, is almost always for the betterment of society. And since religion's nature is to claim infallibility, they deter change and consequent societal improvement by saying: ""what I am saying now is the one and only truth in the world. It always has been and always will be because it is what God wants."" This leaves no room for changes or improvements in ideology and leaves no room for those who believe in a separate code of infallibility. Religion is by nature rigid and stagnant in its policies, and it only helps breed intolerance and ignorance and therefore is far more detrimental to society than it is helpful."	AGAINST
1521	god	"You are really off topic and nothing in your argument is aimed at supporting your belief that society is better off believing in a ""god"" than without. It is already evident to me that you believe that the god that would favor society is only the abrahamic god, is this correct? I gather this from your refutal from my use of mass suicides and cult-like belief as examples. I really dont see why they shouldn't be used as examples in an argument about god - supposing you are just talking about any conceptions of god - . I first argued that it is not for the greater good, because there is the possibility to come up with a lot of conceptions about what god is, how to follow him, how to please him. An example of this are cults. The conceptions range from crazy to crazier. And first we would have to find a way to prove that one conception is the correct one. However you seem to believe that the abrahamic god is the correct one. how can you prove that? Heaven's gate followers had a different conception and they died for it, their beliefs were passionate and convinced. They would have argued for their own view as passionately as someone who wants to believe that the abrahamic god is real and necessary for society. so the first problem is how to find a god that is for the greater good? religion is just as subjective as any opinion in this world. facts on the other hand, are not subjective. if people are given access to facts about situations, it is easier to make better decisions about right and wrong. if we knew the facts about the existence of a soul or not, we would know when consciousness actually begins, and this would help us in deciding whether or not abortion is right, or from when could it be right. does that makes sense? we kill cells every day and we dont feel like murderers. but because right now we do not know yet how to define ""life"", we continue with this myth of ""god created life by breathing his spirit into us"" and then we find this answer more satisfactory than the incomplete scientific search for life... up to now i think it is safer to say, ""i dont know"" than to argue that some god has answers. All societies have their negatives, but I would prefer to dance for rain or bury people in tombs or pray for life than accept sodomy, sell my soul for money, have no respect for myself... why is sodomy wrong? because god told you it is wrong? well... someone elses's god may not have told them it is wrong. how do you prove your god is right? scientifically... why is sodomy wrong if both parties consent to it? People are unable to make the right decisions because they want to base everything on their own idea of how to please their own god. We disagree more and more because religion claims to be absolute about morality, and it doesn't allow for discussion. Instead of saying ""i dont know"" god following people claim to have the answer and thus, there is no opportunity to really agree on anything... at least not with god followers. How can you argue against someone's god that exists only in their head? im glad we don't have to dance for rain and that we can just dance for fun, not to please some gods. :p"	AGAINST

How did a   god  , without beginning and without end, come to be? No one knows for sure how the universe started, but one thing that is for sure is that there is not one scrap of evidence for the existence of a supernatural being. Not one!! There is ample evidence for the non-existence of any god, because where has he, she, or it shown him-, her- or itself? Nowhere. We only have probably fictional accounts in the so-called holy books, which are full of inaccuracies and falsehoods. For example, the Bible says that the world is flat and the sun revolves around it. This is patently false. Therefore, we cannot believe anything in the Bible or the Koran for sure. So there have been no uncontested proofs of any miracles.

1525	god	" Yes God exists, there is evidence that he exists. Enough evidence for the open minded to call it proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But there is still some faith involved. Likewise you have to have faith in athiesm in order to ignore the evidence and not believe in god. One bit of evidence for God is the creation of the universe. ""the big bang"" theory is generally accepted by scientists today. So all time, space and matter had a beginning at some time in the distant past. Before the big bang there was no time space or matter. Christians say God (an infinate being outside of time space and matter) created something out of nothing. Athiests say nothing created something out of nothing. Both views require some faith, but the christian view makes more logical sense and requires less faith. Creation of life on earth is more evidence that points to god (intelegent design). Athiests, darwinists, evolutionists claim that uninteligent, randomizing nature took dead random matter and mixed it together and first life was born. Then every living thing evolved from that first life. Of corse christians think God created man, the animals, and the vegitation. The fossil records show that all life appeared between 600million and 500million bc, and that all life appeared all at once, fully formed, and showed no directional changes through extinction. The fossil records also do not show any transitional forms to support evolution. Again we cannot go back and witness what happened so some faith is required, but the evidence agrees more strongly with creation rather than evolution/athieism/darwinism. And there is much more evidence pointing to God, but if you rule out God to begin with, then all the evidence in the world will never provide ""proof"" that God exists"	FAVOR
1526	god	" So here is the way i look at it, for what its worth, and i am not sure which side i should be on.  There is no proof of the existence of God, but for many there is evidence that points in that direction:  It's like we are part of a painting, and we are trying to figure out the nature of the artist or if there is an artist at all.  All we have to go on is the painting.  The scientist looks at the molecular composition of the paint and the canvas and says there is only what we see.  You have no evidence to claim the artist exists.  Then there are some who say that yes there is a painting therefore there is an artist, he lives and he is beautiful.  Then there are those who look at the composition of the painting and says there is evidence pointing toward an artist, and we can pretty much figure his meaning.  Some people look at the purpose and meaning of life and existence and see the direction of humanity with its struggles and triumphs and the very evolution of the individual as evidence of  ""a God as we understand him"".  It is in this connecting of the dots that some of us find evidence, but no proof.  />   /> There are some who have had profound religious experiences that further enforce that belief.  Those experiences are just as real to the individual as any scientific proof that can be produced.  It may not hold up as factual data, but it does not diminish the experience and its meaning to the individual.  For these people their faith is as real as music is real, but also just as invisible."

1539	god	I believe in gods but not a absolute god such as Jesus christ or Allah that created everything inclusive us human beings. Gods that create everything just didn't exist in me and the reason is very simple.Gods are said to have supernatural powers of everykind such as looking into the future and reading people thoughts and etc.Here is a point which i wanted to raise regarding the genuity of Jesus professed love for everyone.If God have the power to see the future and if he love us why did he create Adam and Mary when he knew that if Adam ate the apple from the tree, he would have betrayed god. If God loves us and have the abilty to see the future, why did he create us humans when he knew that we would eventually become bad and punish those bad humans by flooding the land ?If God have the ability to see the future why did he create lucifer when he knew that lucifer one day will betray him and god will punish him by banishing to hell ?And why did god put the tree of 'not sure what is it called'in the garden of Eden where Adam and Mary lived.If he owns the power to create the universe why is he so unwise to put something that would cause Adam to become a so called 'normal'human being ?If god cares for everyone, why did he in the bible say that animals are for humans to consume for food but not kill for fun. Indirectly he is saying that animals are something he created and we can kill for our own advantage. But apparently animals are similar to us human beings too. Animals have feelings like us and they feel pain when the chopper is brought down to their neck. If God is really benevolant to all living things he could just invoke his magic powers and let the animals feel no pain when they are being slaughtererd.But why did he give animals feelings ?And i strongly feel that we humans aren't suppose to consume animals.Our teeth are harbivourous and our digestive system are that of a vegetarian not a meat eater.We can eat meat yes but not too much as when they die, waste materials in the animals such as Urea will be sstored inside them. When we eat them we eat their waste materials.There are so many inperfections of God and i can hardly name them all in one go.Here is my point and question towards those to believe in god.Why did your beloved god create you when he could just not create you and not make you suffer.Another question:Why did god create us in the first place ?To be his puppets ?For fun ?So that god will not feel lonely ?I heard many weird debaters insulting me as an idoit and so on but this is just my views on christianity and gods that create everything.This argument meant no offense to anybody but is just to express my opinions and beliefs.

There is no survival reason for it, no reason for it to have evolved.  It is art for the sake of art, and the artist is God.  To look around you and not see the hand of the artist is the same as assuming the Mona Lisa was created by accident when a house painter was cleaning his brushes on some canvas.

1556	god	 Why is it when ever meaning of god comes up everyone assumes it is god, father of jesus....theres more to life then christians...and the bible is incomplete for all u uneducated christians out there who refuse to beleive the truth about the hundreds of yrs, and to date, of lies deception and propaganda supplied to them	AGAINST
1557	god	In my point of view it is. yes we may not see God but i dont think life was just an accident, I view life as a test that we either fail or win. The consequence of failing the test, breaking the rules or just trying to cheat our way out is eternity in hell. The treasure of suffering, going through stumbles and believing without seeing but by living by faith results in eternal life in heaven, by trustong God when things seem unreasonable or like a joke we show God just how much we really want to get to be with him by paying the price which is being viewed as a weirdo and being disliked by others for his cause	FAVOR
1558	god	"er, I realize that I've been down voted to nearly oblivion in this debate, but it's certainly is not for a lack of a good arguememt.The point is not that a blind man must rely on others to tell him the sky is blue. Or that the analogy of the blind mind is innaccurate, because it's a matter of everyone being blind, not just the one man.The point is, that if one even excepts that Jesus was ever alive, then there is nothing illogical about this person having been ""great"" but not the son of God. Messenger is assuming so much it boggles the mind, but one of the things specific to this arguement that he/she is assuming, is that Jesus at some time said he was the son of god. Ignoring that there's no evidence this person ever existed. Ignoring that there's no evidence that he is the son of god.There is no evidence he ever claimed to be the son of god.So, you have a statement, ""Jesus was a great man, but not the son of god.""This statement is assuming he existed. Which is debatable. And then assuming that he never claimed to be the son of god. Which is debatable. And then it assumes he was great, which of course giving the debatable nature of the subject, is debatable.Now, Messenger, by his/her near retarded statement - skips over every step of logic a third grader would accidently use, and goes straight to ""Jesus did say he was the son of god, (ignoring whether he ever lived, and whether he ever said that) and therefore, he either must be the son of god, or he was crazy for saying it (even though he may or may not have said it, and may or may not have existed) therefore, he could not have said it and not been the son of god and be a great man.""So, according to Messenger's infintile logic, Jesus is either the son of god, or a crazy person.Nothing in between.Which like so much of Messenger's insane rantings, is completely insane.Given that there is 0 evidence of anything, every option is just as ""logical"" as the next.I was making fun of him/her, attempting to use logic to support an inherently and obviously illogical arguement."

1559	god	"I cannot prove conclusively that God exists in a laboratory. However, the key to the Super Natural is ""Faith"". However, there is some evidence. I can pass on to you that the Bible has survived for centuries and the most widely read text. The world uses the current Calendar based on Christ's death (A.D. - After Death). We refer to B.C.(Before Christ), as well. Now why must it be Faith in order to ""see"" proof? When Christ walked the Earth he performed various miracles and people saw and people hated him. There were those, I'm sure that thought it was fake. I have experienced many things that I knew God sent to me. God does most of His works through people and events for His Children. Just as God feeds the animals He takes care of His own that ""believe"" in Him. God does not want robots to love Him and God gave man the ability to chose, either good or bad. So you wonder why there is so much despair, hate, murder and abuse in the world. Why? because God gave man a choice. Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of their crimes against each other. We as Humans are so quick to dismiss God because we think ""I can't be happy"". Then there are those that just don't believe at all. I also find people can get angry if someone talks about God or Jesus. It is if they are about to catch on fire or something. I think they believe that they cannot be happy. Actually it is evil which whispers in their ear. Even I from time to time am tempted. I leave with you this poem as given to me from God. It had taken me a week to write it. I wrote the first half and when I tried to finish I felt very ill. But nonetheless I did finish. I am merely the writer and not the Author.BLINDOh the pursuits of the flesh This shell that covers self The fix of desire until the next craveSo shallow this fix, never to last Brief satisfaction; my cup now empty This flesh aches between each thirstDay after day the endless search; cup in hand What elixir will fill this cup and empty not The sweet savor that quenches my desireLight begins to dim on this ragged shell This flesh shriveled from the tick of time Cup after cup filled up; folly for the foolThe spirit lay bleached to bone white Picked clean from neglect Left to rot in the hot desert wind of lifeThe spirit left alone, forgotten and unwanted Never watered or nurtured; void of light Cast to the shadows to wither on the vineOh what a wasteland that I made of this spirit For it is I, the spirit, that was starved until death A lifetime to quicken my spirit has cost me the prize"	FAVOR
1560	god	"Hey ""Hostile""ÑHow's it going? Very well, I hope.You're absolutely right on your first point. You can't believe in God ""just in case""... He won't be mocked or fooled.Gosh, I'd hate to worship a flying spaghetti monster, wouldn't you? All that sauce... Oye. Your faith in God wouldn't be wrong, believe me. The Holy Bible is not based on evidence but is backed by evidence, and is an historic book of eyewitness testimonies and fulfilled prophecies and is based on reason. Hinduism and Buddhism, are based on an experiential enjoyment or satisfaction with the text or gods they offer. They do not point to a consistent creator or faith. This is why faith in Egyptian and Mayan gods passed away. Islam took its text from the Bible, said ""Jesus is great, but He's not God"" (an illogical argument), ""we like Mohammed better"" and altered it to suit themselves, something strictly forbidden by the very Bible they took from? Therefore, Mohammed was a false prophet. And Judaism is where Christianity stems fromÑthe two are forever tied to one another.How can one be truly good and deny the creator of his very life? How can God be selfish if He gave you life? Selfishness to me, seems to be the one who lacks respect or gratitude to the one who gives him everything. Would your mother be considered self-centered if you disowned her and wouldn't acknowledge her existence but still had the audacity to want to use her house?God makes Himself known to allÑthrough eyewitness testimony, His word (which has been distributed to just about every tribe, nation, and culture in the world through missionaries for just this purpose), through revelation, through testimony, and through dreams and visions and miracles... All will be shown a way to Him.If one believes in Him, and is an ""_sshole""Ñthen that person either needs to get help from a pastor or psychologist, or ask his/herself if he/she TRULY believes. If one wants to, they can repent. If one prefers being an ""_sshole,"" then that person has made his/her choice.Believing in God does help you follow ""the rules"" better if one is actually following Christ's example, but people do fall short, and all men, not just unbelievers, are guilty of sinning."

1561	god	"The Rabbi is laboring under the mistaken impression that there is a coherent concept of God that would make sense of his/her/its role in creation; and also seems to think that the universe began at some point in time, even though that is actually a misunderstanding of the Big Bang hypothesis, which most physicists do not believe was an absolute beginning, though it may have occurred as far back as we can look. For all we know, the universe is infinite in time and space. One can define an infinite number of explanations for the world and how it came to be (assuming again that it did come to be). For example, maybe the world was created by a single bunny rabbit. On the other hand, maybe it was created by two bunny rabbits. Or three bunny rabbits... Since there are an infinite number of possible explanations, one needs to be able to cut the field down to some manageable number of options. God is not one such options at present because the philosophical contexts in which ""God"" is a valid concept are no longer acceptable. God made sense in terms of Plato or Aristotle's metaphysics. I doubt if the Rabbi is up to specifying a context which would make sense of the God notion. "	AGAINST

1566	god	 Thanks pbeaird for affirming this tested presumption. Antony Garrard Newton Flew calls it the presumption of agnosticism [before his dotage]. It is  a procdedure, a heuristic device.Those non-observations affirm the ignostic-Ockham challenges that either God is fatuous or unartfully redundant,contrary to Alister McGrath. Yes, that extra action means resorting to convoluted ad hoc assumptions, greater than what one was to explain! Yes, there can be no presumption of supernaturalism- Alvin Platinga's warrant for God as a basic belief. That presumption is the pareidolia- like seeing Yeshua in a tortilla-  of seeing a caring,Super Mind behind Existence. That pareidolia is then a mere feeling without substance. Presumption is what one starts with, so one perforce has to start with the naturalist one! One has to employ those observations, accept other minds and the external world and trust in ones mind from trial and error, contrary to C.Lewis and Alvin Platinga argument from reason [ a teleological argument] as basic.  pbeaird, again thanks.

1569	god	"Uh... no.On two levels. Lack of logical possibility and evidence, and secondly, the overwhelming presence of alternatives.We've all experienced real-life probability before, it took about 14.7 trillion (or some ridiculous number of) years for chaotic matter to cool down and form life on our planet and Earth is only going to be around for a few more millenia. Not very miraculous to me. I'm sure we're all versed on evolution. We've observed the processes of which in nature, and there's a clear fossil record which tells a story untouched by mankind millions of years back. And in case you're going to refute this with the incredulous statement that ""life came from nothing"". That's not the case, it gradually developed over a LOOOONG time, and the basic compounds that make us exist all over nature and are generally stable. Ironically, Christians believe that we were pressed from dirt.This eliminates the need for a God to have intervened. Then there is the supposition that a physically impossible being just magically created us, with no possible ability of knowing this except that people from 1000's of years ago who were studying, at best, witchcraft, alchemy, and astrology (not astronomy) were telling the absolute truth when we simultaneously discredit 2,999 other religions based on the very same credibility.This really has nothing to do with facts and evidence at all. We are trapped into believing in God and Heaven because we don't like the alternative of permanent death, that noone is watching over us, and that you've wasted your life in Church. This principle of ""faith"" is simply the emotional refusal to grasp what appears to be a harsh reality.We live in a very sheltered country of America. I'm not cynical, but we swim in water while people in Africa (mostly Christians by the way) are begging for it while being slaughtered, we work effortlessly while near-slaves at home and abroad manufacture our basic goods while we exploit a useless service sector economy. It is to be expected of us to gate ourselves with our dream world.I accept no. 1. Morals aren't that hard to figure out. 2. I'm okay with dying because living forever, if you think about it, would be true hell and it is the fear of death and limited exposure to life that makes life so precious. 3.

1570	god	I would recommend a controversial book titled, PREPARE FOR WAR, by Rebecca Brown MD. I believe she effectively proves the existence of evil and consequently the existence of Gd. While atheism is not of itself a sin leadng to death it is a porthole to evil and a wise person would not go there! Here is a review of her book: This book is a sequel to the much talked about book, HE CAME TO SET THE CAPTIVES FREE, by physician Rebecca Brown. Some would call her a extreme right wing religious fanatic others downright crazy but those who have encountered the rituals and practices of satanists and those who have experienced demonic and satanic activity within the witchcraft or satanic underground would beg to differ with those evaluations. Many more people than you would think have dabbled and even practiced witchcraft and even lesser evils, be it for pleasure or for serious worship and have found this underworld to be wicked and criminal in more ways than one and have little resource as to how to get out of such a mind-controling anti-religious group/groups and Dr. Brown attempts to show people what that world does to innocent victims and how it operates and how unknowing youth are falling into its spiritual warfare and are finding it to be a battle they dont know how to win or even begin to fight against. Dr. Brown shows those individuals that they can leave satan worship and they can only do that by the blood of Jesus and the grace of Gd. She effectively educates the reader on how to avoid these pitfalls and how to pull oneself out of the mire of them and back onto solid and peaceful ground once again. I give this book at 3.5 for her sincerity and conviction to help those caught in the pits of hell on earth. Some will laugh at her efforts, some will scoff at her remarks, but I guarantee you that anyone who has experienced even one of the portals to hell that she exposes will not only understand her but appreciate her willingness to endure ridicule inorder to SET THE CAPTIVES FREE and do that by teaching them to PREPARE FOR WAR. end quoteIm pretty sure that should annoy some   atheists   while I dont know why, they dont believe in Gd so they cant believe in satan, they dont believe in heaven so therefore according to them there is no hell, according to them they have nothing to worry about then! But for those who have seen or experienced satan and his demons, whether in black masses or in dabbling with witchcraft, those people prove beyond a shadow of doubt that Gd exists....and there is a way out of the curse of satanism and that way out is JESUS CHRIST!

Among these chemicals were replicator molecules, complex organics that react with the chemicals around them to form other replicator molecules.  This replication was not perfect, and so the replicators changed... some changes led to improved replication (faster or more accurate) and thus those replicator molecules became the dominant form.

1593	god	"no no no no no.Here is a perfect example of how it's not just religious people who debating but don't argue and change their minds and grow. If it was true that religious people aren't able to communicate as well as politicians then you wouldn't have any converts. THIS is where your warped reality is in play. Religion is the same as politics in this sense. Everything you said about religion is applicable to politics in that paragraph and vice versa.You are still hoping that the god you believe in is real in order to base your morality on it (etc.)You did it again. How can I argue with you when either you don't read what I wrote or you don't understand it. If you did both then you wouldn't have put that down. When two friends of yours get into a fight and one comes to tell you about the situation, you have the choice to make a judgement without listening to the other side of the story. If you do, your judgement is more likely to be flawed than if you allowed yourself to listen to the other side. The more evidence you have, the better the choice you will make.So what's your point? That everybody should hear two sides to every single story they hear? Ideally it would be great, but practically? That means that every single person should know both sides of the story.. but does everyone know both sides? Neither theists or atheists know both sides of the story.. they tend to know little parts of the story, mostly on their side. You tell me how every single person would learn every single story on every single side there is? I have listened to both sides of the story. I have been on both sides of the story. I am now a theist.But INFORMED judgments come from more evidence and knowledgeOnly the INFORMED part comes from evidence and knowledge. Judgement is always subjective.When I hear ""homosexuality is wrong!"" from a religious person, no one is able to give me one reason between stuttering that doesn't boil down to ""the word of god"". This is an exampled of a moral judgement that is uninformed and inaccurate.That's because you're talking to religious people using religious answers! What would you expect?! If they are reasoning then they are informed and accurate. If they're just talking nonsense then it's the same as an atheist talking nonsense. If you wanted an answer without God in it, you should pose the question and say so. I am religious but I always try to give a non-religious answer as you've seen me do. The problem with you is that you expect abnormal responses and when they don't come you blame it on their ignorance.Questioning doesn't just mean going against. It means to question and to be answered. Question - Why do we pray?Answer - To show our faith to God.I don't know where you're from... but where I'm from, questioning is normal.. not an attack from a devil lolololololLOL!.I think what you mean by questioning is to go against. Well obviously religious people wouldn't like that. The same as somebody questioning within a political party. And it should be overcome.. why not?When you say that science does nothing, you sound like a very religious uneducated person. Science does nothing?! geez, now who sounds close minded? A scientific method of reasoning actually tells us to start all inquiries with the premise that we do not know, and thus, we keep on searching.Hmmmm are you sure all of your brain cells are connected??What does science do? Nothing. It's the APPLICATION of science that does something. We can use science to oppress or free, heal or harm, build or destroy. Science does jack shit, but the application or use of science (which is the umbrella term for knowledge) does something and ultimately that's based on people's actions and judgements.Faith is not based on lack of evidence. If it was true then every religious person when confronted would say... God is real no matter what you say. They don't.. they have arguments, debates etc.if your judgement is based on the unfounded belief that people from other countries are inferior, then your judgement will be wrongWait wait wait a minute. Who said that's wrong?? Why is it wrong to believe people from other countries are inferior? YOU said that and that's based on YOUR opinion. However where did I mention this?? You're wasting internet space by talking about completely non related crap.For a judgement to be made you have to have a target. In this case let's use a nation as an example.A's target is to make his nation a religious, clean, fair, community based society for it's own people.B's target is to make his nation an industrial, superpower based on capital regardless of costs.Now, A would not allow immigrants. Not because he doesn't have information or knowledge about them.. but because it doesn't agree with his goal. (I don't mean asylum seekers, simply people moving over the border for jobs, lifestyle etc.) Or he might allow a few if they were similar to his model society.B would allow immigrants as that would provide a quick solution to workforce, cheap labour, manual labour etc. He might not use information or knowledge about them.. but if he wants them he will go for them.You cannot say which one has made the better law just because it goes against your own ideology. If countries ban homosexuality what is it for you to say it's right or wrong? The majority of people in this world don't want gays. Does that mean it's wrong for a country to ban it?Evidence is used to argue for and against religion. You think science and religion is mutually exclusive. You're basing this on lack of evidence."

Our world was round despite the proof or lack of.  It wasn't flat till proven round.  It was simply believed to be round by those who refused to accept the possibility that there was evidence in the stars that we rotated, leading some to accurately come to the conclusion that the earth is round.  I would suggest that your unwillingness to examine the mysteries that would be explained by a Creator God, may indicate an error in the scientific method.

A particular concept of God could indeed be proven self-contradictory and therefore impossible if only anybody were willing to adequately define a God concept. Formerly, philosophers and theologians were able to specify what the hell they were talking about; but god talk is now merely emotional blather and theologies can't even properly be said to be wrong. I make an exception for the God concept of sects like Jehovah's Witness that represent God as a big, powerful animal in the sky, That's goofy science fiction; but at least it makes sense; and the argument against negative arguments does hold in its favor. Maybe a giant bearded tyrant will turn up one of these days.  	AGAINST

1599	god	Truth is you can't prove it.  Ask any scientist.  Not saying it isn't a very good theory, I mean even gravity is just a theory, but it is still just a theory, not fact. Secondly, the existence of a diving being or beings does not require it to be a Christian   god  , or for the Bible to be anything more than a book.  Furthermore, more and more scientists are beginning to say that for the universe to have occured, there would have had to have been a cause for the Big Bang.  Also, while experiments have shown that in stimulations of Earth's early   conditions  , simple amino acids, the building blocks of life, will indeed form, statistics have demonstrated that the chances of these amino acids happening to line up in just the right way to form a protein are so small as to make it virtually impossible.  This isn't opinion, it is what has been shown in experiments and calculations by real scientists.  Intelligent Design is also a theory, not some mumbo jumbo.

1610	god	Thank you for this post. I've been waiting for something like this. :Dperhaps you can clarify, what the greater good is and how we can identify what it is. Let's put it like this.A mother taking her kid for a walk. The kid keeps falling over and cries until the mother picks the kid up and lets her continue to walk. The mother and child are both happy and everytime the child falls, the mother picks the child up.A mother taking her kid for a walk. The kid keeps falling over and cries, but the mother does not pick the kid up. Its cold and unloving, but the mother will not help. Everytime the child falls, the mother only watches.The first mother's child never learns to pick itself up and one day on its own, when it fell, it never got back up. The second child however had learnt how to get back up and on its own was able to continue in life.The second one is the greater good. The mother may seem insensitive and harsh at first, but in the long run, the outcome led to the child's survival. This may seem like an obvious and maybe even biased example, but that is what I mean by the greater good.explain why on your introduction to the debate you have us imagine that we are creating a religion. Read it. It said look at it from this point of view. I haven't brought religion, its values, its history or its rules or stories. Just one of God's roles.What benefit can there be to society where people are creating their own guidelines to follow based on a subjective understanding of a God?Let me name you 5 prophets. Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammed.These people are not creating their own guidelines, but are taking God's Word. Not their understanding, but word for word, God's Words. Over time however Jesus's words have been distorted (as an example) which is not God or Jesus's fault but those who have distorted their word. They are the true prophets. There are several others, but you wouldn't have heard of them. Elron Hubbard is not a prophet, so his followers DO believe in crap and are NOT a benefit to society. But realistically, all religions all in all follow similar rules and these similar rules have nothing stupid.The systematized rules that you mention, come from religion, NOT a belief in god.Ok good point. Especially with the Agnostic part. However earlier I've explained earlier that the systematized rules come from God. But we're not here to talk about the differences in those rules. Just that God HAS given Rules to us. Let's not argue about which one is correct.. that is for a different debate. These rules are for us to follow for the good of mankind. How do we know it's for the good of mankind? Because God gave it to us. God, who is all knowing, all powerful etc. THAT is why we know it is right and if we followed them, we would be living in paradise.IMO agnostics are just confused. They aren't sure on what God wants etc. I'll come to this later. (Remind me)...May I ask you why you believe that people are not able to figure things out on their own?If people were able to figure things out on their own, we wouldn't have any rules etc. The reason we have the law is to guide people. The MAJORITY. How many people out there CAN actually run the country, make all the perfect laws etc? Only God's word is right, because God is perfect only He can make the correct decision.You say that religion should not take the blame for a lot of the ills in society, but look how far religion has come and yet it doesn't seem we are learning how to get along. Maybe it is time to let people figure things out, and see what happens instead of getting stuck in the idea that people need some mythical being to tell them what to do.Again it is not religion which is in the wrong. Religion does say not to kill, drink etc. yet that is what you're saying is wrong. It's not religion that caused crusades. It was religion that was USED. Most wars etc. aren't fought for over religion, but merely use religion as an excuse to get people drawn into it.Maybe it is time to let people figure things out, and see what happens instead of getting stuck in the idea that people need some mythical being to tell them what to do.This is my problem. I have seen all around me what has happened due to the lack of religion. You tell me the problems in todays societies and then tell me is that due to the lack of religion or because of religion. Examples? - Underage sex, alcohol, tobacco, drugs, rape, murder, violence, greed, lust, intoxicants, envy etc. What is it that religion says about those issues?	FAVOR

E.g.,  someone with difficulty handling aggressive impulses may develop an object phobia to knives,  guns, etc. as a purely defensive measure.

If you want to compare your possible conflict to something, you'd be taking the side of the insurgents in Iraq--well armed, have the lay of the land, etc. Now, certainly Americans are killed by those insurgents. BUT they haven't taken one base, they haven't driven out any occupying forces. If it was policy to hunt down insurgent cells as the primary goal, with the entire armed forces brought to bear (as it certainly would be in a civil war) there would be little doubt who the victor would be.

1655	guns	"I'm going to address points out of order more so just for sake of my personal mental clarity.as for modifying 'assault rifles' - make no mistake that modifying a civilian legal firearm like an AK-47 variant (like a WASR-10) or an AR-15 to full auto is a difficult task that requires a skilled machinist and parts and modifications not readily available. this is not something bobby the  backyard gunsmith can do with any kind of provision. At best- they will tamper with the sear engagement (think of it like the govenour on a car) when the sear is tripped- the gun will fire one round- if they mess with it, the gun may just fire from the time its loaded till the time its empty (like having your car 's accelerator floored from the moment you turn on your ignition. At worst (or at best depending on how you look at it) they fudge engagement of the internal workings to the point that the weapon becomes inoperable. I address your Assault weapons question first- because its a pet peeve of mine. Assault weapons is a misnomer. It was a term that has been applied to firearms outside of the definition of the phrase- meaning, its like calling all cars Formula 1 racing cars- one is a subset of the other, and a very exclusive, narrowly defined subset. Next- I guess we just interpret the data differently. (from the CDC) you see one gun death, on record, as justification for banning firearms. There is no data showing how many instances where firearms prevent violence. I've read estimates that say 2 million per year. I'm going to say, for the sake of our argument, that 2m is a gross exaggeration, and I'll say its been exaggerated by 10 fold. so now we have 200,000 examples where firearms prevented violence. If you could do a long term study on that- guns saving lives- that I think is the missing link we need to settle our argument. Do guns cause deaths? yes. Absolutely. I believe (and I really do believe this) that they save more lives.while i'm looking up links- here's gunfacts.         /you might not agree with it, but at least now your aware of its existence. I especially recommend pages 5-10 or so, as they deal with 'assault weapons'. if only so we use the same language to continue our conversation.here is the info on that suggested 2 million saves a year- I admit fully that the data is dated. it was from a study in 1997. thats why I now underestimate it so heavily- (not that I think its gone down, but just because I think the argument is still valid)""Targeting Guns"" Dr Gary Kleck. Florida State University 1997 (I have no digital copy)basically- (and I apologize in advance for this) check pages 15-22 as well. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm lecturing, but I can summarize it- but then you'll just go check it anyway, so I figure why not waste your time.If you think any of these studies are for some reason less valid then the ones you mention, we can talk about sample size, statistical integrity, and all of that stuff. Your reference to Europe, I think, is circular. You focus on Gun violence.Cut out gun- and you still have violence. Thats the big problem, and many European countries have that in no short supply. Heck after the UK ban on guns went into effect the Lethality of Officer involved confrontation (meaning violence against officers) increased significantly as the police' ballistic vests could not withstand the surge in knife wounds. They created a monster where MORE people died.As for your brother's practices- I believe all gun owners, after passing the required background check and safety courses, having been established to be of sound mind and body- should be allowed to carry their firearms. My father has carried since 1979 and has never once brandished a firearm in anger or accidentally. Thats almost 30 responsible years of no incident."	FAVOR

1657	guns	"Does a criminal care about the law? Obviously not. If anyone advocating gun control laws, and/orcomplete anti-fun prohibition could understand that no matter how many laws you pass, you willnot stop a criminal from getting what they want, we might not even be having this debate. Go to a""ghetto"" talk to some people, I can assure you, that before the day is over, you will have acquireda weapon for between 100 and 400 dollars. A criminal doesn't care what laws they are breaking, all they need to do, is find a source that will supply them with weapons, be it internally from the USor externally from another country. A person can acquire any type of weapon they want to withoutnotice, aside from nuclear weapons, and even those are starting to become more widelyaccessible.So should you own a gun? In my opinion yes, guns don't kill people, people kill people. No matterwhat kind of reasoning you try to support it with, a gun is nothing by a tool, a means to an end. Aperson provides the intent. Without the person, you have a tool that serves no purpose. The onlyway to remove the intent is to remove the person, not the tool. A weapon comes in many forms,from a butter knife, to a span of rope used for a garrote, or a baseball bat used to bludgeon.Should we ban anything and everything that resembles a weapon, or can be used as a weapon?Might as well ban all forms of writing utensils, because a pen, and pencil can be used to killa person. Anything can become a weapon, as long as the person has the will and intent to makeit so.Banning guns, only serves to prevent those who wish to arm themselves against forces unseenfrom gaining access to said protection. A person, has the ""right"" to use an equal amount of forceas the aggressor is using. Aside from that, my personal belief is that a person should in the faceof danger to life, limb or eyesight, use whatever means of force of escalation within their means, beit excessive or not, to retain their personage whole and complete.

This could be done in a barracks, in which case, the right to ""keep"" arms would have nothing to do with a right to individual possess. In Parker v.

1662	guns	"I am sorry for having gotten so long winded.  You chose an interesting one ... in your view that guns and gun rights protect a right to threaten violence.  I disagree, although depending on how we parse the characteristics of ""threat"" and ""deterrent.""  So, on one hand, I can see your view that guns might represent the ability to threaten violence.  In other words, it might be said that ""the homeowner's pistol represented a threat to the burglar.""  But although these claims can be made, I think a more honest approach is to explore the differences between what ""threaten"" and ""deter"" connote.  I will argue that the history and the intent of the second amendment (and the purpose of gun ownership) aligns more closely with deterrence than with threat.Webster's unabridged defines ""deter"" as ""to discourage, to prevent, or to hinder"" (eg. the presence of the police officer deterred the thief).  Threaten is defined as a ""declaration of an intention to inflict injury or punishment, or to indicate impending evil or mischief"" (eg. the thief threatened to stab me if I did not turn over my wallet).  Take personal defensive weapons, for example.  Forty-eight states have laws that allowed licensed, concealed carry of loaded defensive weapons, while about half the states allow open (visible) carry of a gun (some require a license, others don't).  I bring up open carry because the more common concealed part complicates my point.  Take two men, strangers, walking down the sidewalk in Burlington, Vermont (where it is legal to carry a firearm openly, without any restrictive license).  Each of the men have a holstered Colt 1911 on their hip.  At this point, neither of the men are threatening violence (nor, of course, do they have any right to).  They each walk into the same jewelry store, and browse around.  Suddenly, one of the men pulls his pistol, points it at the teller, and demands ""give me the money or I will shoot you.""  At this point, that man is threatening violence, which he of course has no right to do.  So the other armed man quickly draws his gun and stops this threat of criminal violence with a well-placed head shot.  This action is lawful because state statutes declare that the use of lethal force is authorized to prevent death or grave bodily injury of yourself and others, or to stop the commission of a forcible felony.  I would argue that the second man represented a deterrent instead of a threat.  Two men, two guns, two actions ... one a threat, and the other a deterrent."	FAVOR

1664	guns	"There are alternatives for students to protect themselves ""from criminals from various crimes from assault, rape to murder.""  The colleges themselves can provide self defense classes to teach students specific techniques to protect themselves from attackers.  These classes can even include what one should do in different situations of a gun attack without actually having to fire back with a gun, but instead with the weapons around us everyday, like knives and hammers.  Even concealed self defense items like pepper spray may be the difference between life and death; it depends on the situation.  Yes, security does indeed hold firearms, but they are trained; they actually know what they are doing and are less likely to shoot someone irrationally or accidently.  Even students who are knowledgeable on how to use guns should not be permitted to carry them, exposed or concealed, on campus.  Campus often times is a temporary home to students, a place where they can seek safety.  How can they feel safe knowing that everyone around them is potentially carrying a gun, from the calm and seemingly harmless students to the troublemakers who are arrested at least twice a month?  Concealed firearms can quickly escalate a simple argument into a tragedy.  And if there is an attacker, with or without a gun, the concealed firearms of the victims can be used against them if they are overpowered.  The police and campus security not only try to stop attacks while they are happening, but they also try to avoid them from occurring in the first place.  With students allowed to have concealed weapons on campus, it would be more difficult for security to decipher who could be considered a potential threat and who is not.  Plus, what edge do the cops have if the students are allowed to carry concealed firearms?  No, students and people in general do not always follow the law, and of course the ""cops cant be everywhere at once to protect everyone.""  However, arenÕt the chances of a shooting lessened if it is forbidden for students to carry firearms on campus, especially considering that security would be on the lookout for such weaponry?  And when does it end?  A pistol, a rifle, a semiautomatic?  To believe that they do not have Òany chanceÓ at protecting themselves without possessing a gun is a fallacy; it is a lie.  Besides, once you decide to carry a gun for constant protection from others, you decide to view all other people as potential enemies instead of potential friends.  And with this lack of faith in humankind you have taken that first small step into the direction of using your weapon for the wrong reason or worse out of hasty impulse."	AGAINST

Before you say they wont be able to tell who the attacker is in a shooting event find me one instance where that has happened off a college campus because I looked and couldn't find even one instance. Also since it says concealed then it means concealed I carry a full size handgun and I have many friends who don't know I carry and no one has ever noticed it. That is also the reason I don't believe there is a need for rifles on campus because they cannot be concealed and gets rid of the element of surprise. You really need to go Google ""semiautomatic"", most firearms sold today are semiautomatic and they are no more dangerous than any other firearm out there. They still fire one bullet for one trigger pull just like any revolver or hunting rifle, they are no more dangerous or deadly. Tell me how you are going to protect yourself from an armed attacker at 20ft, hell make it 15ft, how is it a fallacy or how am I a liar? Do you have other options yea possibly; you might be able to run away, maybe the attacker will be stupid and get close so you can attempt some move you saw in a movie, maybe you have pepper spray and the person reacts the same way I did and gets more agitated and angry and kills you anyways(not to mention most sprays can take up to 15 seconds to fully start working and are also banned on most college campuses).I carry a gun everyday at all times where it is legal and I don't look at everyone as a potential enemy but I do understand and accept the fact that there are evil people out there that would hurt me or my family and I will do whatever it takes to keep my loved ones safe. Also by your reasoning every cop in America that carries a firearm is on their way to using their weapon for the wrong reason or out of hasty impulse.

Even if it really was a 3% chance, I think I'd rather have that 3% chance to live than nothing, even the smallest percent is MORE THAN ENOUGH.If guns are banned, do any of you think criminals or ""law abiding"" citizens will abide by it?Though they may be faulty, some criminals know how to manufacture their own guns. Despite being faulty, they are still guns, and they can still kill. Therefore, in a society with outlawed weapons, a massive black market will arise with criminally manufactured weapons and weapons that already exist. The same thing is going on for marijuana, cocaine, and meth, and the method of sale and purchase is no different for guns. How? Because drugs are illegal, and if guns are too, then they will just be circulated the exact same way.Clearly we can't trust our the people and criminals with guns, but we can trust them to follow the laws? We would ultimately create more criminals because a majority of the 90 million gun owners like myself would not abide by it.If guns are banned, it wouldn't prevent suicide. People will just start hanging themselves or drive off a cliff. I don't believe everyone should have a gun. Law-abiding citizens who know how to use it should. By no means should anyone who is mentally insane, a felon, or simply ignorant be able to use one. Keep in mind anti-gun people complain about accidents or tragedies that happen because someone didn't know how to use a gun. You are, in fact, one of those people who does not know how to use a gun. Therefore, you are helpless, ignorant, and have no right to tell people who do know how to use guns what to do."	FAVOR

In fact, that statistic has been called into question consistently - and is easily disputed when compared to reported crime rates and common sense. Please cite the studies and we'll get into the details. Suffice it to say, there are not 2.5m thwarted crimes each year thanks to quick drawing gun owners.For every documented case of a permit holder thwarting a crime, I can show you several documented cases of a gun owner killing an innocent person. Hard to balance that cost with the benefit of occasional prevention.The rest of your argument doesn't seem to hold up when you look at the stats.         Florida was well above the national average in 1987 across all categories of crime. By 1993, most crime rates had gone up, continuing to stay above the national average. One category - homicide - fell from 11.4 per 100k residents to 8.9, falling just below the national average of 9.5 that year. Every other crime category saw an increase. So where were the concealed weapons effects there? How do you presume to prove that concealed weapon permit holders caused the decrease in homicide rates?Asking gun owners how often their guns stopped a crime is a highly charged question prone to error. The measured results show that the period of time you chose to look at saw an increase in the crime rate. And most people who study crime (peer-reviewed scientists and government agencies) will tell you that citizens' rate of gun ownership, concealed carry permit count and other measures of gun use by non-criminals has no material effect on crime rates.Perception is a powerful tool. Citing disputed results as indisputable and cherry picking statistics is not a valid way to form public opinion or guide legislation.

Eliminating all guns? let me build a little scenario for you-remember that thing in America way back when called Prohibition? By making a desirable, but if misused dangerous commodity illegal- the US Government created a situation where it was SO profitable to break the law and provide this illegal item that it gave rise to organized crime and distribution of products on the black market that this country had never before seen.so how would that work with guns? If made illegal- they would become so desirable an underground economy (one that already exists, you would just be empowering it) would explode with traffic from the criminal element in our country.so who wouldn't have guns? Honest citizens who obey laws, even when they are unjust.who would have guns? Criminals. laws didn't prevent them before- and now you just made it more profitable for them to traffic their wares.To suggest that the gun lobby is driven by capitalism and not have anything to do with National history, American Rights, or in my personal opinion- good sense- is asinine.Outlawing fire-extinguishers doesn't prevent crime. Nor does cutting down in their availability. To limit the flow of firearms will not cut down in violent crime- at best it will manifest itself in a different, and probably more violent form- at worst, it will be business as usual, just fewer good men and women will have an opportunity to resist and protect their way of life.

1715	guns	We agree on some things- violent   crime   in general in the US is higher than a lot of places- even if you remove gun violence (  murder   rate for instance) As far as developed nations go, we are fairly violent. I think that is by in large the result of our immense diversity. I forget the paper, but there was a study some time ago that suggested homogeneity in a population is less violent than a heterogeneous mix like we have here.The UK, Germany, and Austrailia all have much lower populations, much more 'similar' populations, and still suffer the effects of violence. I concede I didn't make this point clearly- but what I was getting at is that even in a situation that is far more controllable with a much lower population, I don't feel the controls your suggesting work.As for the driver thing- I agree its a crap analogy- but its one most people are familiar with. I think a better analogy was when I compared it to   alcohol   and prohibition. Though we do not have a constitutional right to alcohol like we do   guns  - if I follow your logic they are equivalent. Neither is necessary in your mind and does more harm than good.If I can make that assumption- then I have to say I don't think your style of control will work. I just feel like history more supports my argument.I was just looking at some numbers on line- and maybe we can meet in the middle.Comparing NYC to London- populations are within 1 million people of each other, with NYC being slightly larger. Police budgets are close when you switch with current exchange rates.however- London has 7x the amount of crime NYC has. (mind you the UK doesn't tally offenses committed by offenders under the age of 16). whats the big difference? NYC has 40% more cops patrolling than London. Now maybe crime is grossly under reported in NYC. I lived there for 5.5 years- and I would believe that there is some definate under reporting going on to make it look safer than it is- but I'm not sure even if you inflate the rate for NYC and deflate London for some reason that they would be close. If any of my point is to be considered let it be this: Gun control is an expensive exercise that at best strips people of rights, and at worst is an exercise in futility that does not reduce violent crime.Even if the US numbers of crimes prevented with guns is inflated- by say 50 fold, than that estimated 2 million preventions still becomes 40,000- 4x higher than the US murder rate in 2007 with guns (just over 10,000) over a nearly 700 of which, were justifiable shootings by   law     enforcement and civilians in self defense cases.I think your focusing on the violent crime rate in the US and equating that to gun crime- and they just aren't the same.I disagree with your methods, but maybe we can both agree that our   money   as tax payers, our safety as people, and our rights as citizens are best protected by something that isn't   gun control  .

1727	guns	 This is one of the few areas where I think America has got it right. In fact, I would say there are too many restrictions on gun ownership in America. Widespread gun ownership does not necessarily equal a large number of deaths through random acts of violence. The opposite could just as well be argued. Look at Switzerland. There is very little crime there. Yet virtually every Swiss male is in possession of an assault rifle. Every Swiss male is inducted into the military and upon induction is given an assault rifle and told to keep it in his home for use in case the country is ever invaded. This service as a soldier in the military reserve is essentially lifelong.   />   /> Watching the BBC, they endlessly harp on this gun ownership issue when covering the US every time there is a massacre.   />   /> America was, to a large extent, populated by criminals.

The simple fact is that your community doesn't have the right or the moral authority to democratically limit the rights of gun owners in your community.  I know that you said ""constitutionally acceptable"", but realistically there are only two limitations that you can place on gun ownership that would fit within that description.  Those would be, in a broad sense, the ability to restrict felons and insane persons from owning guns through an instant background check process, and to restrict the use of guns for anything other than their intended purpose (e.g. Self-Defense, target shooting, hunting etc.)  Any other restriction, e.g. the type of firearms or restricting the use of guns or the transportation of guns is all unconstitutional.  One thing you must ALWAYS keep in mind that the people within the Brady Campaign will NEVER tell you is that only people who are generally law abiding will obey the rules you put in place anyway.  That criminals will ALWAYS have guns and will NEVER follow the rules, because they are criminals!  Putting restrictions on guns only limits the people who are willing to follow those laws and puts your average American at a distinct disadvantage.

1731	guns	Look at a country such as South Africa. The law there requires that gun owners either store their weapons in government approved safes or that they carry their weapons on their bodies. Based on the opinions expressed here, that should mean that they are much safer than other countries particularly since a large proportion of the population owns some sort of weapon (and most choose to carry since the safes are expensive). The reality is that they are not. Instead criminals assume that anyone they attack is carrying and don't bother using the guns as threats. Instead criminals shoot first out of fear that their victims will be able to shoot back otherwise. The number of robberies that would result in wounded pride and a small financial loss in the U.S. instead result in murder. While I am an American, the only people I know who have been held up in this country have escaped unharmed, while I have known two S. Africans who were killed during petty theft and I have S. African friends who have safe room built into their homes as insurance against home invasions by armed robbers. These are not elitist rich isolated folks who have been impacted by the criminal response to gun laws, but everyday middle class citizens.The idea that many of my fellow citizens are walking around armed scares me more than the idea that some criminals might have weapons. I have no issues with sport rifles used for hunting and I don't have an issue with individuals living in rural areas where wildlife poses enough of a threat that carrying a gun could be considered a safety measure as long as the owners are trained in their use.

It was Tabutt's live-in fiancee, 62-year-old Nancy Dinsmore, who family members say he was going to marry Saturday. Tabutt told authorities he thought she was next to him in bed the whole time."" - At this time please click the link at the bottom of this page and view the news video of the tragic 911 call. If you dont want to view the video, dont bother reading this. - Its traumatic accidents like that, that prove why using guns for defense, is dangerous no matter what. If that man had just tased the ""intruder"" they could still be alive and happily married. Some people may call this a one time accident, but people think of guns almost by default as necessary to self-defense. Infact all of the people ""for"" gun-rights used that idea and phrased it as the only way. But in no way is something as deadly as that gun, the only way. Our school is a gun free environment, or better phrased, has gun control. Do students feel safe? Yes, because guns are not allowed so the fear of being shot is alot less. Could a gun be entered into a school? Yes but if it was fired, we have designated lockdown drills we have practiced and one schools shooting kills lots less then if we were to have guns everyday.Think of america as an environment with guns available everyday. Imagine how many lives would be taken due to anger or other temporary emotional disabilities. We cant keep amusing the worst of everyone around us.

Are the guns the MS-13 have the reason they are so violent? Remember when skinheads just kicked the crap out of people? I wonder if their steel-toed boots suddenly make them violent? Is it just possible that it is the inherent, violent proclivity of some people the real problem. While I would agree that the act of killing and robbing may be easier when the bad guy has a gun, but if I have a gun as well (which I do) and I have some training (which I do, and I advocate training and regular practice) my chances of surviving a negative encounter with a robber or killer is greatly improved. However, my theory about the miraculous removal of all guns from private ownership would simply result in attacks by a greater force from which I could not defend i.e. more bad guys acting in concert against one person. With a firearm I am a formidable opponent; without one I am a victim and a statistic. I plan on being neither.As to the issue of common sense, I have yet to hear from the gun control group ANYTHING that even comes close to common sense when it comes to limiting my ability to defend myself and my family. I don't see any common sense in limiting me to one-gun-per-month schemes. When I lived in SoCal most gun owners took that to mean, not a limitation of one-gun-per-month, but a requirement of one-gun-per-month. Many of us purchased many more guns than we normally would have due to that limitation. This was especially true in the case of collectors of hard to find, out of production firearms. At one point I had as many as nine guns paid for but I couldn't take possession of them. I had to wait months before I could bring them home. In almost every case these guns were unsuited for anything but collecting but there was no provision in the law for that. Explain the ""common-sense"" in that? I'll tell you what common sense is. Common sense is educating responsible, law-abiding gun owners, the ones who buy one gun for home defense, about gun safety. Oops, the NRA does that already. So why is the NRA so demonized and vilified?

The reason for this is based, in large part, in history, but it remains relevant today. At the time of the drafting of the Constitution, one of the greatest fears was that a King-like figure would emerge in American government, or that the government would simply become despotic and tyrannical, like Britain was believed to have become leading up to the Revolutionary war. Hedging against the emergence of a tyranny in America, therefore, was of primary concern. The Second Amendment was designed to ensure that the people were fully empowered with the threat of violence to combat the emergence of a tyrant. This took the form of an individual right to bear arms and to form a militia to combat a tyrannical government. "	FAVOR

1752	guns	I have heard the following argument on several occasions in the past and again yesterday as to why the Second Amendment as a guarantee that the people shall have the right to keep and bear arms is obsolete: ÒArmed with only rifles and pistols, how could you possibly prevail against the Army?ÓThat question in and of itself should be a self-evident answer as to why the Second Amendment is in place and why it is important that we not allow it to be undermined.All throughout history there have been many military conflicts in which an outnumbered and out-gunned force was able to either hold their own for a significant time and/or prevail in the conflict.In many of these cases people fought a superior force that had invaded their homeland. People fought fiercely and in many cases prevailed. To do so they utilized every weapon they had available to them including improvised weapons such as Molotov Cocktails.They also had talented and dedicated people who were able to design and manufacture weapons under extremely trying circumstances.People who use this as an argument, I suspect, arenÕt fully informed about a number of things including the fact that there more armed people in the United States than there are military personnel, the dedication of those armed people to protect and defend freedom and liberty, that the illegal use of the military against the civilian population would certainly be met with intense resistance, probably in the form of guerilla warfare, and the possibility that many members of the military may refuse to follow illegal orders to attack the civilian population.Further, people donÕt realize that it wouldnÕt take many armed citizens to overpower some elements of the military and take control of the more advanced weapons at hand.Consider the use of the Liberator pistol provided to the French resistance during WWII. These cheaply made, single shot pistols (IÕm told that it took longer to reload one than to manufacture one) was used to eliminate a single enemy soldier and take his arms.Although I am unable to locate the source of this bit of info, I recall hearing that the Rhodesian military was ordered not to fire their weapons on full-auto in order to conserve ammo when faced with a vastly superior force that was constantly re-supplied by the Soviet Union. The Rhodesians were able to hold their own for some time in the face of a larger force.One must also consider how the Soviet Army was eventually defeated by the people of Afghanistan.However, I find the idea that a person could even consider the possibility that the United States government would use the military against the civilian population to be more than a little disturbing.Seriously, how could anyone suggest such a possibility? Are they suggesting that the United States federal government would deploy tanks and aircraft against us?No, I think it unlikely that the U.S. government would do that. Certainly the government is aware of two things: one that to mobilize the military against civilians is illegal and second they know what the response would be.

Last year, as I was hiking up the Marble Fork Creek with my 8 year old cousin, at approximately 2.5 miles in I stumbled across a fair amount of irrigation hose running from the creek.  Long story short, I immediately realized that I was in a bad place!  It was close to September, which is near harvest time.  I pulled my cousin close to me and whispered quietly that we need to turn around and quickly hike out of the area.  The growers must have seen us, because before we were 300 yards down trail we were met with 2 men at our front with rifles and shortly a man followed from behind with a revolver.  We were held at gun point for 2-3 hours and we were terrified for our lives.  To this day I am not sure why we were released, and I am not making any judgements as to if I had a firearm whether it would have made a difference or just escalated the situation?!  I do advocate the ability to carry   firearms   in the park and personally hold a CCWP, but thought that it would be interesting to share my experience with the readers on this blog.    If I HAD to guess why we were released, I think that farmers wanted no part in harming a young child.  Had I been alone, I would have had my concealed weapon on me regardless of Federal Law. (Going over in my head what I though I would have done) I BELIEVE I would have drawn my weapon at the first sign of danger, and to guess from there is futile!  My true protection that day was in the hands of a higher power!     As I camp, hike, fish, cave, climb, pack stock and such in the National Forest surrounding this area (Legal Gun Carry Zone), I wanted to give a quick list of reasons for carrying.  1) Pack   animals  , I had a horse break it's leg and had to put it down (Sad!),  2) stalked once by a mountain lion (very rare) scared it off, 3) blew a lock off a gate at the end of a remote jeep trail (put there by people to impede travel of vehicles for environmental purposes) 5.5 hour journey to return to the trail head, 4) 2 aggressive rattle snakes that I had no way of backing down to avoid, 5) Coyotes trying to attack our 5 month old puppy and drag it out to kill from our campsite.  These are only MY personal justifications. I think it is a line in a movie but so true.  A gun is a tool, and the best reason for having one is for ""all of the reasons I can't think of!""

You don't wear it for the 99.9% of the time you arrive at your destination without incident. You wear it for that one time - just one - where you don't. It only takes once.

However a lot of people purchase guns and do not know what to do with them at all.  That is the kind of people  that makes everyone else look bad.  If a person is not instructed on how to use the gun--then they are a danger to themselves and the people they live with.  Remember guns do not kill.  But people kill.  Remember the make my day law???? Anyone--it gives you the right to protect your self and your family as well.  Lets face reality--if a person breaks in to your home with you in it--he or she means business--and you are in grave danger as well---so the only defense would be to have a gun in the house and know how to use it as well. I do not agree with the old cliche--make sure the robbers are in the house and then shoot to kill.  However you can detain them long enough to call the law and have them picked up and put in jail instead---then press charges. As far as guns in a educational facility--I do not agree with that at all.

In the first two years after gun-owners were forced to surrender 640,381 personal firearms, government statistics show a dramatic increase in criminal activity.353354 In 2001-2002, homicides were up another 20%.according to Australian Institute of Criminology, ÒReport #46: Homicide in Australia, 2001-2002"", April 2003From the inception of firearm confiscation to March 27, 2000, the numbers are:¥ Gun murders up 19%¥ Armed robbery up 69%¥ Home invasions up 21%The sad part is that in the 15 years before national gun confiscation:¥ Firearm-related homicides dropped nearly 66%.¥ Firearm-related deaths fell 50%. Gun crimes are rising throughout Australia after guns were banned. In Sydney alone, robbery rates with guns rose 160% in 2001, more in the previous year.according to The Sydney Morning Herald, ÒCosta targets armed robbersÓ, April 4, 2002 A ten year study that concluded Australian firearm confiscation had no effect on crime rates.According to ""Gun Laws and Sudden Death: Did the Australian Firearms Legislation of 1996 Make a Difference?"", Dr. Jeanine Baker and Dr. Samara McPhedran, British Journal of Criminology, November 2006.So as you can see we want to ban guns too because it worked out so well in Australia. Also concerning your claim that there are 39892 gun deaths in the US in 1994 according to your 45% of the total stat. According to the FBI website there were only 16,305 murders in 1994. Wow that takes that number down quite a bit, the rest are suicides the estimate from the department of Justice is about 54% that's 21,541 so that leaves 2,046 deaths attributed to unintentional, and undetermined reasons. So taking out just suicides (studies have shown rates don't change with or without guns present so these people would kill themselves anyways), that leaves 18,351 gun deaths in 1994. That's brings it down to 6.55 per 100,000. We can even go lower also according to the FBI in the early 90's approximately 5,000 of the murders a year were committed by people on parole or had an early release for felonies that brings it down to 4.77 because as we all know it is illegal for felons to have guns and as they have proved before they always follow the law not to mention a lot of them got out early and committed another violent crime. Also according to the Department of Justice the homicide rate in 1994 for non-gun deaths was 3.1 wow that still puts us in the top ten on your chart. Also the US isn't even in the Top 10 for homicides in a country according to the UN Office on Drug and Crime from 1998-2000.I could sit on here and give facts and stats all day long but I doubt that would ever change your mind. It all comes down to the fact that more people die from diseases, car wrecks from drunk driving incidents than are killed my guns in a year.

1793	guns	Please Please Please go do some research before you post such things that are so incorrect and full of fallacies and misconceptions. I am going to attempt to answer your assumptions one at a time. First you have to be 21 to obtain a Concealed Weapons Permit(CWP) so having 20 year-olds isn't going to happen. As for the next 7 or so small paragraphs, I am sorry you feel like you would do this if you owned or carried a gun but as history shows us none of the scenarios you listed have happened ever. CWP holders carry everywhere off campus so why does the imaginary line of crossing on campus suddenly make everyone irresponsible and basically stupid? This stuff doesn't happen off campus so why would it mysteriously happen on campus. As for the drinking how many times have you gone drunk to class? I know I never have and nor as anyone I know. I obviously don't know the number of CWP holders in the US to assume there are enough to have multiple CWP holders at one place during one shooting and them take each other out(again never happened anywhere off campus so why will it happen on campus). In the US there are about 1 CWP holder out of every 100 citizens. For the 21-30 age group that is much lower in the range of 1 in 300. So in your largest lecture class of 300+ students you statistically might have 1 CWP holder carrying a weapon for self defense. In your next section you state instances several times of   guns   just going off. I have been working with   firearms   for a long time and I also am an instructor and I can tell you will all certainty there is no presently built firearm that just goes off. Companies go out of their way to make sure a firearm cant just go off, almost all new firearms also have drop safeties so you could throw it out a car at 100mph and it still wouldn't go off(it would ruin a perfectly good handgun tho). I am seeing in your writing that you have a genuine fear of firearms and I am sorry for that, I really suggest you go to a local range and go talk to the people there about possibly taking a class so you can better understand firearms and their use because you really don't understand them now. As for the becoming desensitized to gunshots, first all of your other scenarios are completely baseless so you wouldn't have this massive increase of gunfire anyways, but even if you did(never would happen) most people don't know what sound a firearm really makes anyways. They assume it is a car backfiring or a firecracker. As for allowing teachers to carry and not students what is the difference between a first year teacher and a 26 year old Iraq veteran going back to school? Why or how is the teacher better qualified than the student? Ok so after watching your so called video evidence it makes sense that you have a distorted view of reality please visit      to get a dose of reality.  You obviously don't understand firearms or their owners so I am not going to spend any more time on you. Please just do some research before you post any other fantasy scenario that has/would never happen. 	FAVOR

What has been ignored by both sides in this debate is the history and purpose of the Second Amendment as understood by the founders.  Succinctly:  the right to keep to bear arms is NOT meant to protect us from criminals breaking into our houses at night.  Nor is it meant to permit us to hunt white-tailed deer.  It is meant to protect us FROM OUR OWN GOVERNMENT.  We have complex set of checks and balances in this country that prevent the accumulation of power in the hands of one person (or small group of people).  These checks have worked very well so far.  But in the event they fail, the Second Amendment acts as the last check on a tyranny by allowing the citizens to overthrow the government should it ever AGAIN become necessary.  Remember, this country only exists because well-armed citizens overthrew their government, which had become illegitimate by violating the rights of individuals.  This is an ethical argument, not a practical argument like the one's made by statisticians.  Guns may save lives or cost lives on a day-to-day basis, but disarming the citizenry gives the government FAR more power over us than was ever intended.  And if you think that fear of one's own government is no longer a concern in the 21st century, think again.  Even today at least 40% of the world's population (mostly in China and the Middle East) lives under brutal tyranny.  And even in this country we now have warrantless wiretapping and other abuses of the Constitution.  And although private guns owners wouldn't stand a chance against the U.S. army in a straight up fight, this is no reason to concede the philosophical point that power in this country is supposed to rest with the people, and not with the government.  Private gun ownership is based on a bedrock principle of this republic, and should not be dismissed for emotional reasons, even if it does save lives.  (""Give me liberty or give me death"").

1797	guns	Adam-The reason we feel the Brady Campaign is pushing for total disarmament is this (forgive me I'm going to give a number of links and explanations):    note the above first- the brady campaign seeker tighter regulation of the firearms industry with regards to safety. Outwardly it seems like a very reasonable policy, make safe tools for people to use safely. No one would be against such a thing.However, these regulations are already in place, things like transfer bar safeties, drop test requirements, and a variety of other safety features are included in all firearms of modern manufacture. the firearm described by the Brady campaign in that section, with shorter barrel lengths, is actually THE IDEAL handgun for self defense because they lend themselves to actually being carried. eliminating guns with barrel lengths under 3 in eliminates the compact auto and compact revolver market- driving several gun manufacturers completely out of business; despite the fact that their products are very accurate, safe, and useful.I'm not sure if I'm making my point clear, but they are not pushing for the elimination of junk guns, but the total elimination of a style of extremely useful defensive gun utilized heavily by private citizens.then lets look at the assault weapons ban    besides a number of bans by name, the parameters for the ban eliminate a number of other guns as well. Handguns over 50 oz for instance eliminate a number of excellent hunting pistols (mine included) most importantly however, they ban a number of guns that really aren't used in crimes. In my original post some ways up the 1994 AWB stopped citizens from buying guns that were involved in less than 2% of gun related crimes. NONE of which are easily converted to full auto, despite what the Brady Campaign will say.They also put up wildly inaccurate information. if you look under assault rifles vs hunting rifles, where 'assault rifles are meant to be spray fired from the hip' that is a totally made up assessment. No 'assault rifle' (which for the most part are not available to citizens because a true assault rifle is fully automatic, so already they are dishonest with their naming) is intended to be used in such an inaccurate manner. Ask any military friend what happened if they tried to fire their m16 from the hip. I bet their Drill Instructor gave them a verbal berating they wouldn't soon forget.Also- the difference between a hunting rifle and a assault rifle by their definition, is the stock, magazine, and in some ways the barrel configuration. All of these are readily changeable parts on a firearm. This allows the Brady Campaign to ban hunting rifles just by saying they can be easily converted to assault rifles- allowing them to extend their ban to eliminate virtually all semi-automatic weapons.People can talk about legitimate sporting purposes all they want, but the fact is, I own a number of military style weapons, both rifles and handguns, and am completely safe. To limit my rights on strawman arguments against crimes that frankly have not occurred is a complete disservice to me as a citizen.    above note the dreaded 'gunshow' loophole.I'll be brief with this section as it is so fraught with error it is insulting to have listed such a thing as fact. To say that a full quarter of gunshow tables do not have gun licenses may be accurate, simply because there are easily that many tables at a gun show NOT selling guns of any sort.	FAVOR

1802	guns	I grew up in a house hold around firearms.  I was taught from an early age to respect them and to know what kind of damage they are capable of if misused.  Even with the access I had to them as a child, I never dreamed of using one to solve any altercations I may have encountered.  My heart goes out to those who have lost children because they, as parents were incapable of doing their job and teaching their children to respect them.  A gun is simply a tool, nothing more.  A child could take a sword to school and do as much damage as a gun can.  A kid could take his fork from lunch and stab the person next to him and kill him.  How many children have been killed by rocks?  I am sorry if my chosen past time makes you uncomfortable, I truly am.  I have made offers to many who oppose firearms to come out to my range and allow me to teach them about firearms and operate a few of them in a controlled environment where safety is of the utmost importance.

One of which was to insure our populations right to arm themselves.   /> Frankly I agree, and I think that history would support me on this. A government needs to be at least slightly afraid of what its people might do, or else they tend to collect more and more powers to themselves, and govern in such a way that has less and less to do with the wishes of the people.

Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990)- "" ""the people"" seems to be a term of art used in select parts of the Constitution and contrasts with the words ""person"" and ""accused"" used in Articles of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments regulating criminal procedures.

1814	guns	"My objection is the argument that only ""irresponsible"" people cause accidental gun deaths so it's not worth changing the laws for everyone else. This presumes that we need guns in the hands of responsible people and the deaths of kids due to irresponsible people is just an unfortunate, but necessary, cost of keeping gun ownership legal.The statistical facts are that guns in a home increase the chance that someone in that home will be killed by that gun due to a homicide, suicide or accident at a level well above the chance that the gun will be used for self-defense. Here is the list of stats and their sources on one website:        I tend to believe the CDC and New England Journal of Medicine, though I'm sure the NRA's researchers will claim they have some anti-gun agenda funded by their insatiable desire to obtain more tax dollars or perhaps those pediatricians' blood thirsty quest to keep their patients alive so they can keep billing them for office visits...I'm not sure what alliance a concealed carry permit holder is making with the police. Are you going to be drawing your weapon and shooting at any criminal you see? I haven't seen any police chief or FBI director endorse that kind of help. I don't doubt that most gun owners are law abiding. The problem is that several thousand each year are not. And when they want to break the law, they have an almost unlimited access to incredibly powerful weapons. We would all be far safer if those people were presented with the choice of using a knife or their fists versus having to try to break into a military base to obtain a weapon more powerful and dangerous than a hunting rifle. Several hundred more gun owners make the mistake each year of leaving their weapons where a child can get access to them and then shoot themselves or someone else.Your point that large scale public shootings happen BECAUSE of ""no gun zones"" - is one of the more incendiary arguments I've heard in awhile. The point of not allowing guns in there is to prevent the kind of crime that happened. If those people had to go through a rigorous licensing process, have to pay a hefty fee to own even one rifle and in general not have the option of buying up several hand guns, semi automatic assault rifles and armor piercing bullets with a valid drivers license and a fairly clean criminal background, they wouldn't have the ability to kill at the scale and efficiency they've been able to achieve. The thought that the best defense against those kind of people is to arm everyone who wants to carry a gun around town is a leap of faith most people are not willing to make. We'd rather have everyone but the police disarmed and make it much more difficult for mentally disturbed/violent/criminal/irresponsible people to obtain weapons. And the incidents are not ""rare"". Killing ten or more people intentionally in the span of 30 minutes is ""rare"" when it happens once a year. Having a student come into school and shoot classmates and teachers is ""rare"" when it happens once every five years. When it happens 5-10 times per year, it's ""frequent"".And as a final note - the rate of deaths due to lots of other causes far exceeds handguns. Heart disease, lung cancer, traffic fatalities, pedestrian deaths etc. The difference is that these are all by products of either diseases or useful tools where most people agree their benefits outweigh the costs. Most people don't agree that the benefit of gun ownership outweighs the cost to society. But because most people don't care enough to lobby and vote based on this issue as much as the NRA lobbies and funds campaigns against congressmen that vote against them, legislators don't take their side."

Let's not forget about all of the bullet holes everywhere.

Guns in backpacks will go off because the safety is not on.If students have guns then they are going to want to practice their aiming skills. That means building a gun shooting range, or allowing students to make their own targets and practice in an unsafe   environment  , which some will unfortunately do regardless of whether a safe facility is provided for them.Having hundreds of guns on campus, means listening to gunshots at all hours of the day and night. In addition to the annoyance of hearing gunshots, people would become desensitized to the presence of guns and sound of gunshots. Becoming desensitized to the sound of gunshots means that people would ignore them, and thus when a psycho started firing, people would under-react. (In my highschool, the fire alarm would go off at least five times a month because of faulty wiring. In the four years that I attended, I learned to ignore the fire alarm since there was NEVER a real fire. When fire drills were performed, a staff member would have to go on the speaker, and say that ""this is a practice   drill  , please evacuate,"" because otherwise people wouldn't get out of their desks. If there ever was a real fire, no one would respond promptly and there would be a delay of several minutes before people started to evacuate the building.)If teachers,   parents  , and students, feel that guns MUST me present at   schools   in order to ensure the peace, safety, and securtiy of their staff and students, then the TEACHERS should carry guns.I WOULD NEVER GO TO A COLLEGE THAT ALLOWED ITS STUDENTS TO HAVE GUNS, because I wouldn't feel SAFE.I reccommend that people watch this YouTube video.

1819	guns	Dmonasgprivate sales between persons are a horse of a different color. I must admit I don't purchase firearms from private individuals, just because I like to have a warranty with products.The capacity thing I disagree on, but I can see where you are coming from.  There are a lot of gun games that require higher capacity weapons, and also there have unfortunately been a number of civilian involved shootings where a person had to fight off, for lack of a better term, multiple attackers.if you look at a lot of the guns used in crimes, many can't even hold more than 10 rounds. A lot of the handguns used for crime are just not in that category.we'll come back to capacity restrictions in a minute-I agree, some people on my side of the fence are a bit right of 'hard liner' with some of their views. Their thought process, or the thought process of some of the ones I've encountered, is as follows:'death by a thousand papercuts' progressively more and more little bits of legislation to limit and price out many members of society from firearm ownership, until they have been forced to exist as a small minority- where they no longer have their rights respected.many of those hard liners look at Australia and Great Britain, countries where legislation was increased, steadily for years, and then all of a  sudden, their rights were stroked away with a single move of a pen. Overall violence in both countries went up after those pen strokes.they are so fearful of being boxed into a corner that they lash out at any legislation.I hate to make this reference, but it is one worth repeating. So I apologize in advance. Nazi Germany had gun laws that basically broke down as follows- you could own weapons for hunting, and you could store them at your local police station. To many, that sounds REASONABLE. some would say that its not a bad idea to have laws like that here.we are obviously NOT nazi Germany; however, none of us can read the future. we don't know what rights our kids, our our grandchildren may need to be happy and healthy in our society. This goes beyond guns too. If we allow guns and the 2nd amendment to be gutted, we set precedent for the WHOLE bill of rights to fall under scrutiny.I'm not against background checks- I think they are a great thing. The capacity ban I think is silly, just because most encounters and shootings in the civilian world happen with less than 5 rounds- its somewhere on the FBI website, but you can check.so why limit something that isn't a problem?A lot of people say, well what about that bank of America robbery in California? that was a terrible tragedy, where 2 crazy guys did some serious gun smithing and black market dealing to get some heavy weaponry.but what ended it? Police, taking civilian legal guns (ar-15s) and putting the shooters down. what was the response of California? ban civilians from owning the types of rifles the police took from a gunshop to stop the gunmen.The problem I think, is that most of these legislators are more concerned with hype and votes than understanding the issue- so they put a lot of stuff together that sounds big and bad- and try to ban it. Alls that ends up doing is punishing law abiding citizens. Even if i don't agree with a law, I still obey it. we are paying the price for their lack of diligence, and we pay it with our rights and our tax dollars.The other problem is, much of the reasonable measures you talk about, get unreasonable things tacked on to them. Sure background checks are legal, but what was the fat stuck on that bill? what else were we forced to sacrifice to get one good thing?thats more of a line veto question, but think of some of the laws that aren't gun related, that have passed regarding your hobbies. how much of it could have been better for citizens if the legislators really understood the subject, instead of focusing on what sounded big? what sounded good?I think you make good points, but I think the price for some of the reasonable things comes with a higher price tag than many expect. for instance- the brady campaign has a big push to oppose a bill right now- saying it would make it legal for children to walk the streets of DC with assault rifles.if you read the bill, it basically undoes the unconstitutional ban, as ruled by the Supreme Court, in washington DC.Don't forget also that DC, or Phili- these are cities with the tightest and most restrictive gun laws. yet they have the most violence. if that doesn't prove that much of this legislation is wasted, I don't know what does.

However, the report noted, 'None of the studies can prove causation. They merely examine the statistical association between gun availability and homicide.' In fact, major studies on this issue have not shown cause-and-effect Ð that the presence of guns causes more murders to occur (or crime in general) Ð which is certainly a more difficult hypothesis to test.""Though I personally am a strong supporter of gun ownership and do believe that widespread gun ownership is safer than none, the argument for it (or against it), when it comes to causation of crime and murder, is not as simple as the NRA or the the States United to Prevent Gun Violence suggests.

These and many other reasonable restrictions on the rights granted to us by the constitution have been enforceable laws for decades and no one would argue they've put the entire Bill of Rights at risk. Present and Future America is happy to have these kinds of protections.By the way - my point in the first posting is that many of the rights in the Bill of Rights have already been curtailed surreptitiously (including one of your hypotheticals - the right to defend your charges in court - Habeus Corpus). I'm not in favor of this - I am in favor of a law being debated and passed to accomplish this restriction. If the NRA would spend some lobbying dollars to reign in an executive branch gone haywire, they might start getting some of my money. You could argue no one's done more to trample on the Bill of Rights than this current administration. Isn't the NRA supposed to protect the Constitution?Future America will likely think it odd that their ancestors thought shoppers in a mall with a gun holster under their coats were the most reasonable protection we could envision against mentally disturbed people who were determined to kill as many people as they could. Some weapons are just too dangerous for the average person on the street to possess.As long as we're talking about freedom and the bill of rights, I would like to point out that I'm in favor of personal liberties. If handguns weren't killing other people at alarming rates, and only killing their owners, I wouldn't have a problem with them. The issue is that handguns and assault rifles kill other people, by design. The studies have shown that handguns are used in homicides and cause accidental deaths at a far higher rate than they are used in self-defense. They provide the ability to kill quickly and rapidly.

1839	guns	As an outsider, I've always found the idea that US citizens feel a need to arm themselves against their government as fairly curious. While I can understand the historical context in which the 2nd Amendment was made, getting my head around the present day relevance of it is difficult. From my (limited) observations, there seems to be a perception of the government as a monolithic ill-intentioned entity that is constantly plotting the oppression of the American people, yet I can see no credible basis for this perception, but perhaps its a cultural thing...From my perspective, government is simply an organisational construct made up of people. People who have more or less the same basic ideas and values as those who distrust the government. It has no will of its own, and can only act through the actions of people. If the people who are acting on the government's behalf are citizens like everyone else, with the same values and beliefs, it seems doubtful that many of them would willingly turn of the majority of their fellows. In my experience, governments are not evil but rather benignly incompetent. When they do harm to people, it tends to be by accident rather than intent. To infer malfeasance from incompetence, and using it to justify an armed populace on the basis of an unlikely scenario eventuating, seems to me to be drawing a very long bow.This brings me to a couple of questions that someone might like to answer for me (or at least comment on):1.

1842	guns	"The days of people truly needing guns in their everyday lives to protect themselves from predatory animals are gone, at least in the vast majority of the United States (even Montana)  Predatory people, on the other hand, are something else entirely.  Nowhere do law abiding citizens need guns more than in poor urban communities rocked by gang violence.  Gangsters do not follow the laws, nor do they get their guns legally.  Those who intend to use their guns for less-than-legal purposes will aquire them in less-than-legal ways.  The only way to insure that the common man can bring the same firepower as a hardened ganster to the fight at his front door is to lift firearm restrictions.  Gangsters are not the only predatory people out there, however.  In the Declaration of Independence, it is written, ""That whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends, (life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.""  The Second Amendment was written to insure that should this country come to such dire straits, the people would be able to fight back.  It is for that reason that any and all restrictions on the Constitutional right to bear arms are unacceptable.  It was the intention of the Founding Fathers for citizens to possess military-grade weapons to prevent the government from overstepping its bounds.  The Supreme Court is NOT the last word against tyranny, it is an educated and well-armed populace.  That is what firearms (and arms in general, as technology advances) mean in America.  "	FAVOR

The Brady Campaign completely ignores that fact.    this is a final point about registration. Much of what they propose already happens, and much of what the rest of they propose here is meant to increase the cost of firearm ownership to the point as to price much of the middle class out of the market.

I would rather have the comfort of having a firearm on my person or close by, than to have a knife or some sort of blunt object (Granted I have killed a rattle snake with a large rock before). In regards to protection from people same thing I feel safe knowing that I have a firearm that is readily accessible if needed. I live by a few rules when it comes to owning and using a firearm. Assume it is always loaded, do not aim it at anything you do not intend to kill, and only use it as a last resort. I do believe in gun control, but only in regards to Assault Rifles, fully automatics, and Maximum Magazine capacity. Assault rifles and fully automatics were designed with one purpose in mind, to kill people. Maximum magazine capacity, is in regards to the saying ""bullets do not discriminate,"" the fewer rounds, the less likely to have any collateral damage. Limiting magazine capacity should be directly related to the Caliber/Gage of the fire arm. By this I mean the power behind the projectile. A 9mm has substantially less stopping power than a .357, and that less than a .45. Shotguns although they may be more powerful at close range, should be limited as little as possible. The reasoning behind this is, if all you have is a shotgun, and the person is at a distance, I would rather hit them several times, before they become within lethal range. Mainly because being peppered by a shotgun, in my opinion, would make many people think twice about coming any closer. Although I do Support owning firearms, I also do support proper storage and personal safety precautions. Such as trigger locks, Safes, and storing them unloaded. These are all good precautions because if someone breaks into your house, and your weapons are not secure they can be used against you and your family, just as easily as they can be used for protection."

In Japan recently a factory worker and video game player rented a truck, drove it into a crowd, jumped out, and stabbed seventeen killing seven. Here sudden violence is called Going Postal. Most do not know that that name is a Culture Bound Syndrome. The same violence in Malaysia is called Amok. Among the Navajo it is iich'aa. It has been happening for centuries around the world. Subliminal Distraction is a likely cause. The Virginia Tech, Redlake school, Joleka school, and Atlanta Day Trader shooters all had Subliminal Distraction exposure. They also had mental events near the  shooting. SD is known to cause a mental break where it was discovered in business offices. The cubicle was designed to deal with the vision startle reflex to control the problem. Schools are unaware of  the phenomenon even though it is explained in college psychology. They do not offer Cubicle Level Protection or warn students. Home computer use where others can move in peripheral vision are a likely source of exposure. Your subliminal sight in peripheral vision reacts to movement. It does not identify the object. You do that when you complete the reflex, turn and look. Serious exposure begins when you learn to consciously ignore movement around you so you can continue working with out the startle. But you cannot prevent your brain continuing to detect threat-movement. The repeating subliminal appreciation of that movement will eventually color thought and reason. You too can be a victim. Sudden violence is not the only outcome. Symptoms of exposure are fear, paranoia, panic attacks, depression and thoughts of suicide. I am reminded of a saying from the old west. ""God made man Mr. Colt made them equal."" Guns do not cause crime, accidents, or suicides. The issue is not safety. You cannot prevent sudden violence.

1897	guns	Please explain how having the tools, skills, and will to stop this incident before it ever became a horrible ordeal could have possibly made it worse?When I lived in that great gun-ban paradise Chicago, I was raped.  Not only did the police fail to act on my prior reports of stalking and harassment, but thanks to the rapist's shall-we-say connections he was never arrested or prosecuted.I now live in a state where I can own and carry a gun for personal defense.  My training includes gun handling and safety control under stress, combat marksmanship, the judicious use of deadly force, weapon retention, and force-on-force (actual combat using non-lethal Simuntion marking cartridges or Airsoft guns).

1898	guns	If you stay in the city and are uncomfortable with   firearms   then by all means, don't buy one.  We're talking about people who want them for perfectly legitimate and necessary reasons of self defense, to have them in   national parks  .National parks are, in many places, wilderness.  Wilderness with   animals  , reptiles and sometimes people who threaten other people's personal safety.  We are afforded a right to self defense by any means through common and established   law  .  Removing one of the best and immediate ways of self defense by banning firearms in National Parks significantly impedes that right.  I am happy the government finally realized that.I always carry a firearm when I go into the woods, most often a handgun because it's smaller, lighter and easier with which to navigate through the bush.  I always felt ignoring this law would be the best policy for myself, believing that facing a judge would be more preferable than facing a pack of feral dogs or some other wild animal that would do me harm.

1905	guns	"I stand by original statement - criminals aren't _killed_ by private gun owners (or shot by them) at nearly the rate that victims and innocent people are.The ""1.5m people use guns defensively every year"" statistic is a tough one. I can find studies that refute that number and I'm sure you can find studies that show it's higher. The true number will probably never be known. It's like asking a car owner ""what's the fastest you have driven in the last twelve months?"" - many honest people will answer that incorrectly and passionate people may exaggerate the truth.I know it's hard to listen to the other side on an issue you passionately believe in, but I'm pretty sure no reasonable person believes James Brady is a brainwasher. Getting shot by some nutjob with no business possessing a weapon is a pretty good motivator to spread the word on this issue, but I think his namesake organization stops well short of brainwashing. I'm pretty sure he'd tell you that defensive gun stats don't make up for the fact that he's paralyzed and the President almost died (again) at the hands of a gun owner.Would you argue that the Constitution features a gun ownership right because of the deterrent effects on crime? Or the deterrent against a tyrannical government? I'd argue the latter. I don't trust most people I know, let alone the population at large, to brandish a firearm and have the ability to kill 6-9 people in under a minute if they decide they are a threat to them. The fact that so many innocent people get killed by guns each year, and in dramatically sad ways like mass public shootings, makes it particularly hard to justify the need for their easy possession or a calculation that there's a greater need to keep guns on the streets for crime prevention. Especially when guns enable crime - making their deterrent effect diminished. I think a gun owner should calculate that there's a pretty high chance anyone motivated enough to rob/attack them is armed. If you believe escalating a property crime to a homicide is the right response, I don't think you're in the same camp as most people.I do think killings would go down if we took most guns off the street. That's both criminals and victims dying. ""General violence"" as described above may go up, but if fewer people die isn't that still a net positive? I'm not aware of gun-control countries having significantly higher rates of violent crimes than the U.S. - I'm willing to eat my words if that's true.So I'm not here to argue for the rights of criminals. I'm here to argue for everyone's right to not be killed by a gun."	AGAINST

1908	guns	If some people are irresponsible and routinely or momentarily fail to prevent small children from having access to their guns, then they should be punished under the appropriate laws (reckless endangerment, involuntary manslaughter, or whatever that may be).  If someone fails to properly keep knives out of reach of a child and that child stabs itself, you don't propose to ban non-governmental ownership of knives.  If some moron buckles their 2 year old into the front seat without a child seat of their car and that child is injured or killed, you don't propose to ban non-governmental ownership of automobiles arguing that public transportation will fulfill our transportation needs.  I know some people are horribly irresponsible.  I've read the horror stories too.  That's why my handgun is in my nightstand inside of a biometric (fingerprint) safe so that my 3 year old son can't get to it, but if the drug dealer that has followed me home twice decides to break in I can keep him from harming my son rather than just calling the police to come put me and my family in body bags.

Simply because gun owners have become less negligent over time doesn't mean gun ownership now justifies kids dying. The facts are that guns don't prevent crimes in the classic NRA image (a homeowner killing an intruder or a ""responsible"" vigilante shooting dead a perceived threatening person) at nearly the rate that children, spouses, neighbors, policemen and innocent bystanders are killed by guns. The benefit has never outweighed the costs. Only concentrated lobbying dollars has kept this fact from guiding legislation.Think of the people you know who you consider to be a little ""off"". Quick to fight. Quick to throw a punch. Now imagine them armed. Able to pull out a weapon and begin killing people instantly. Do you feel safer knowing they can get a gun anytime they wish?Ask any policeman - people who spend more time with guns, and the people that use them, than the vast majority of the population - if they would prefer everyone they encounter to be armed. I've never met a policeman who encouraged the population to be more armed so their jobs would be easier. I'm sure you'll find sheriffs pandering for votes in Nevada or Florida who would disagree, but actual frontline patrolmen would tell you it's a terrible idea. Fistfights become gun fights. Knife fights become gun fights. Etc.The second amendment was conceived in the 18th century by a war-weary country who had just ""negotiated"" their freedom using muskets and bayonets. Britain had used gun control to ensure there were no insurrections or Protestant uprisings against the crown and the Founding Fathers didn't want to see that policy enacted in the US. The NRA enjoys trotting out this logic - that somehow banning guns ensures an Orwellian state's rule over us - but today's technology and political reality shows the fallacy of this logic. One could argue that with Habeas Corpus suspended, electronic eavesdropping legalized and ""secret executive powers"" an unchecked privilege, the citizens of this country have never had less freedom or been less in control. Not one bullet has been fired to achieve this and no one doubts that any armed revolution would be put down quickly by the U.S. military. Gun control is a crime and safety issue - not one of political independence or ""protection"" from the same government the NRA insists enforce existing gun laws by prying into suspected criminals' homes to keep guns out of their possession.The NRA demonstrably puts the interests of their dues paying members (gun manufacturers and gun owners) ahead of the majority of the U.S. population who do not want guns on the streets. The concentrated benefits of their lobbying dollars outweighs the diluted interest level and attention of the average voter.

1931	guns	"Let me go point by point:- The ""inconclusive"" description in the first cited CDC study is in regards to their ability to from a conclusion either way (proving gun control works or proving it doesn't work). You need to look at the full sentence which I've edited for brevity by removing studies' names:""On the basis of national law assessments (...), international comparisons (..), and index studies (..), available evidence was insufficient to determine whether the degree of firearms regulation was associated with decreased (or increased) violence. The findings were inconsistent and most studies were methodologically inadequate to allow conclusions about causal effects."" If gun ownership was such a clear deterrent to crime and benefit to society, how could any of these non-partisan studies be inconsistent or nonconclusive? It's not from a lack of looking or research. If there's any reasonable doubt, you should err on the side of safety and take guns off the streets. The results in terms of gun deaths, homicide rates and other measures of gun-related violence in other developed countries with gun restrictions seems to prove conclusively that gun control keeps citizens safer and does not enable criminals to go on an armed rampage unchecked by helpless civilians (Penn and Teller's academic research not withstanding. As an aside I think they are hilarious paid good money to see them in Vegas and would gladly do so again).- 65% use of guns in school homicides still sounds amazingly high to me. Why not target that going to zero?- I appreciate the primer on ballistics. I'm not sure you'll ever convince me that civilian guns have been watered down so as to be ""acceptably"" dangerous when shot. Assault rifles, if only used to shoot animals and targets, and never modified to become fully automatic, would be of no threat to anyone. But in reality they are not. Some get modified and some get used to kill multiple people. What's the sporting benefit that outweighs this risk? Why not use a hunting rifle with a 5 or even 7 bullet clip? And why on earth is a .50 calibre sniper's rifle even an option for a civilian to purchase?- See many European countries as evidence for the lack of actual black market results when gun ownership is restricted. Prohibition was a curtailment of a personal choice that did not involve the killing of innocent bystanders and enablement of deranged people to go on killing sprees. The majority of people voted to repeal it. The majority of people today would vote to get guns off the street. It's the concentrated lobbying power of the minority of people that own guns that keep the laws as is.- My brother keeps a loaded 9mm Glock in his house with no trigger lock and in an unlocked lock box (lost the key). His rationale is that if he needs to use it, he needs to get to it quickly. The risk of his 3 year old getting access to it doesn't seem to concern him as much. He is one of many, many ""real gun owners"" who prove that all of the NRA preaching about personal responsibility, education and screening really don't work. As this study shows:        most gun owners don't observe the safety rules they were trained on, and a significant number were never even trained.So unfortunately a few bad apples (gun owners who kill people) do spoil the bunch. It's not worth the risk of death to everyone (children, students, bystanders, victims) to enable gun enthusiasts to keep most of their guns and the inconclusive crime deterrent effects they may provide. I think we could all live with a system that makes gun ownership a significant burden to achieve, costly to maintain and restricted to a very narrow collection of hunting rifles. It would still enable the right to bear arms, but not make it so easy to enable so many deaths and injuries."	AGAINST

A gun, a Taser (keep in mind, the types that actually shoot out electrodes often cost more than a quality handgun), or pepper spray?

A Glock 19 will give you 15 shots and nobody can shake off new holes being put in them.Keep in mind, this guy will kill you unless you intervene. The idea of concealed carrying is that you're only going to use it if you think someone is going to kill you.

The expense of healthcare is why people canÕt currently afford healthcare apart from insurance or medicare. The costs associated with healthcare are not a reflection of the actual costs to provide healthcare, but more accurately are a reflection of the greed for profit that exists within healthcare, pharmaceutical, and insurance companies. We need healthcare that provides reasonable services and products at reasonable prices, not healthcare that compels exorbitant fees at devalued wages. And lastly, the very fact that insurance companies and government, not the patients, are paying for the majority of the cost of healthcare enables the greed of the healthcare industry. Healthcare that only insurance companies and government can afford enriches only the healthcare providers at the expense of the working class.

A company that's in business to make money. Money that could go towards actual health care instead of the insurance's pockets.But lets follow your logic and see where it leads. Most people don't require health care every day. But the do require food every day. Now, since it is inhumane to let people go hungry, we should have nationalized meals for every citizen (a roast in every pot). But we need people in place to collect the money and distribute the money, etc. We'll call them the Nutrition Insurance Group (NIG). now, they need to get paid for their services but where is that money coming from? Oh yeah, the people. But it now cost more money to feed the same amount of people because we now have to pay for the NIG. No problem, we cut back on their rations (they're too fat anyway) and on the quality of the food. Now once people get used to the idea of NIG, we can raise the price of food because, ""Don't worry about it. The insurance will take care of it.""

He was adamant that it was necessary until I mentioned that I did not have insurance.)Or we can leave it (conserve it) as it is (which is why we call ourselves conservatives).

Therefore, since you obviously lean toward socialism in your opinions, the fact that you say you love capitalism is completely hypocritical.  The reason capitalism works better than any other economic policy is because it benefits more from greed than any other.  Greed causes people to work hard and earn their share in a capitalist   society   which benefits because products are made and services are provided to earn that   money   people greedily strive for.  Socialism enslaves greedy people because they do not have the freedom to keep what they earn and therefore they detest society.  They begin to lose motivation because they cannot keep what they earn and therefore, why work hard?  There is no point.  It is easier to do nothing and mooch off the system because that's what other people get to do.  Greed is natural and capitalism suits it.Next, as an outsider of this conversation, I do not believe Mike made any huge distortions on what you said.  Perhaps you did not say what you meant but he replied objectively and directly to what you posted.  My suggestion would be to try to clarify what you mean instead of getting insulted by a direct response to what you said.As for your apparent belief that the wealthy people of this country try to hold on to their wealth, (""As it stands, the wealth of this country rests in the hands of the very few, who exert their control to keep it a very small group."") this is absolutely not true.  Take a look at some statistics on donations and you'll notice that the wealthiest are the most charitable by far.  Also, the wealthiest provide the most   jobs  , consume the most goods, buy the most   cars  , and pay far more than their share of   taxes  .  Yes, this is because they have more money, but don't you want your employer to have more money than you so they can afford to pay you?  Personally, I want my employer to be the richest man in the country so he can pay me the highest salary in the country...Last point I want to make is that seeking   health care   is indeed a right.  Having it is a right if you provide it to yourself.  Making someone else pay someone else to provide you health care is not a right.  The right to life means nobody else can   murder   you.  It does not mean someone else must take care of you.  People die every day and as long as people are being born every day, that will continue.  What matters is that everyone has the freedom to seek a better quality of life.  Each individual can choose their own path to pursue happiness because nobody's path is the same.  If you treat individuals as a group, that is assuming that they are not just equal but THE SAME.  I strive to be better than my neighbors because I am greedy/motivated/whateveryouwanttocallit.  My motivation makes me better and makes me work harder.  In working harder, I contribute more to society while I get more out of it.  It's a win-win because I do better and society does better.

2058	healthcare	"The question posed can serve as a Rorshach test.  I could just as easily debate one side as the other.  So I have difficulty deciding if my response is pro or con.  Given the non-specificity of the question, I will alter the frame to one I can endorse.I would like to have some level of health coverage for all US citizens.  De facto, we have emergency coverage and hospitalization coverage.  We cannot turn patients away from the emergency department.  If the patient has medical need for hospitalization, we must provide care.  We cannot ""dump"" the patient to another hospital.But that is not the question we should answer.  Would we as a country benefit from a form of universal health coverage?  I would point out that the question does not imply a single payer system.  Rather should we develop a minimal health coverage that all should have.  Should we adopt a version of the Massachusetts plan?We could argue this question as a moral issue.  Some would argue that health care is a right.  Calling health care a right raises another interesting debate.  That debate involves semantics and definitions.  I would prefer to avoid the moral debate, and view this question more pragmatically.We have much data on the value of primary care.  I refer to this definition: ""A set of attributes, as in the 1978 IOM definitionÑcare that is accessible, comprehensive, coordinated, continuous, and accountableÑor as defined by Starfield (1992)Ñcare that is characterized by first contact, accessibility, longitudinality, and comprehensiveness.""  Our current payment scheme does not encourage physicians to enter the field. So I would like to see universal health coverage for true primary care, as I believe that investing upstream would decrease costs downstream.We already have de facto hospitalization, so we obviously should encourage formal coverage for hospitalization.How can we afford such a plan?  I will argue that we can only afford universal health coverage if we adopt some capitalistic principles.  Such a plan will only work if the patient has appropriate responsibility for health care costs.  We could prorate their share of any diagnostic testing, hospitalization or drugs. Having patients involved financially in decision making  should help physicians with several discussions.  First, patients often want an expensive diagnostic test.  If I believe that the test is not truly indicated, then I try to convince the patient not to have the test.  Involving money in the discussion only works if the patient is actually paying a portion of the costs.  Second, this strategy would encourage patients to use appropriate generic drugs.  When patients have responsibility for drug costs, they become very interested in $4/month prescriptions.  Without this incentive, they will often want a drug that they have seen advertised on television or in magazines.So with many caveats I favor universal health coverage.  I believe that the investment would ultimately save societal resources."	FAVOR

Simple answer - we can't be sure.  Nobody has ever been sure and nobody will ever be sure.  The best solution is to teach your   kids   how to work hard and do well.If we provide   health insurance   ""for free"" (which simply means the cost is hidden from view in   taxes  ), it will not encourage people to work hard for it.

Because they don't make enough   money  .  As I explicitly pointed out earlier, money is a symbol.

End of story.""UHC plan based its argument on the premise that the health care system can be cured by taking the profit motive out of the system - as other countries do.""  I have a lot to say about this one.First, we cannot compare America to other countries.  We are bigger, more divided, more diverse, and more free.  It's apples to oranges.Second, taking the profit motive out accomplishes several things, none of which cure our system.  It takes out the motive to keep spending down.  If there is no need to turn a profit, there is no need to cut spending, ever.  It also reduces the motive to keep consumers happy.  Happy customers means returning customers means profit.  No profit means who cares if the customers are happy.  Especially scary in this case because we will be paying for it whether we accept the gov insurance or not (again, the cost is shifted out of sight in taxes, it doesn't disappear)  Taking out the profit motive in no way at all guarantees reduced administrative costs.  Third, if UHC based its argument on this premise, it is clearly a very very stupid idea.Good job using CA as an example.... wait, aren't they bankrupt?  Yeah, good idea, let's do that!To point out why they are bankrupt in a very simplified way:They increased taxes on the rich so much that the rich people got fed up and moved out (rightly so).  They stopped raking in money because there was no money left in the state.If taxes are increased still further for the rich in the whole country.... AND if the quality of their health care decreases....  do you really want to piss off the people that pay for your government????  The people that actually have money to spend in this country????""This will make health care affordable, cheaper and provide access for all.""I hate to sound cold because I care about people so much that I actually want this country to thrive, but why do we care about ALL?

Sick and injured people are less productive.2) When you have multiple competing insurance companies, each company has to repeat the same work.

2115	healthcare	Merlinda,You do bring up good points that small businesses would benefit. However, the rest of your argument I believe is false.UHC would not benefit the majority of people.  Most Americans have   health insurance  . I am a little confused with your point on the single buyer and competition.  If you are referring to insurance companies as the sellers than you may not understand the UHC bill.  If you are referring to   health   equipment providers, which I assume you are, then you are mistaken that this would create more competition. Competition increases with more buyers and more sellers.  The more diverse the market, the more competition.  Competition is already a big part of health equipment providers in that a doctor can choose what to prescribe (usually they recommend generics because of price), a physical therapist can choose what wheelchair brand to prescribe, etc. Why will more qualified healthcare workers be selected? They will be paid less, so I would assume that less qualified people would apply for the   jobs  . The more qualified people will want to get paid what they're worth.I would hope that people would be more likely to see a doctor for preventative care but I do not believe this will happen.  If a person knows that they have health coverage then what encourages them to take care of themselves?  It won't matter if they skip an appointment, they're covered if something bad happens. On the other hand, if a person knows that they are not covered and will have to pay ridiculous amounts of   money   if something bad happens, they will try to prevent that from happening. Overall, I believe a better solution to this problem would be to increase competition by eliminating tax benefits for bulk purchase of health coverage. Reducing the employer based system will increase the number of buyers because people will buy individually or for their families.  Increasing competition between insurance companies will force them to reduce spending and maximize customer base.  AKA let's bring back a free market because capitalism works best while retaining individual rights and freedoms.  AKA capitalism benefits the majority of people (and that's the best we can hope for).

2136	healthcare	Because I'm just going to go to town and summarize my position. Just going to town. Hoo-ha. Okay.Health Care is really, really important. It's important to determine whether   health care   is actually in need of serious overhaul, or just a bit of trimming around the edges. I'm going to try and prove to you, with sources and everything, why we need the   public option   that's currently on the table in   congress  .First of all, I'll say that US Health-care is indeed the most technologically advanced health care in the world. I firmly believe that. Unfortunately, all of that great   technology   doesn't do us much good if it can only be used by ten people a year. Living in a country with a high-tech machine that can save your life is meaningless if you can't afford it.So here are the facts.47 Million Americans don't have   health insurance  .    .  obama  /Millions more are under-insured.    That's why most bankruptcies in the US are about medical bills.    /And a third of people responding to surveys say that they aren't complying with perscriptions because of the cost, up from a fourth about three years ago.    Yes, you can go to an emergency room no matter what. Unfortunately, an ER visit doesn't give you any preventative   medicine  . I don't have a link for this, but if you doubt me please go to an ER and ask for a colonoscopy or a mammogram.The American Cancer Society found that (and this is sort of a duh thing)   cancer   kills more often if you don't have adequate health insurance.    +for+providingIf you want the statistical cost of our current health care system, there are three numbers you need to remember. 12,000, 18,000, and 100,000. Feel free to repeat those.12,000 is the number of   children   that would live, not die, each year if the US's infant mortality rate were as low as Japans, Sweden's, France's, Germany's or Italy's. An American mother is three times more likely to lose a child before the age of 5 as a mother in the Czech Republic.    +infant+mortality+rate&st=nyt18,000 Americans die every year because of a lack of   health   coverage. They don't get preventative care, timely diagnoses, or specialist treatments.    And lastly, the big number--100,000 Americans would survive every year if our health care system did as well on prevantable   deaths   due to treatable   conditions   as health care in Japan, France, and Australia. The US has the worst ranking throughout industrialized nations in this area.    So that's just death, that just refers to who dies. Who knows who survives the subpar treatment, who lives with chronic injury and crippling pain, a lowered quality of life?So how does that measure up to how much we spend on it?Not well...    We spend twice as much as a lot of countries that are outperforming us.So we're at the big problem stage, I hope you/d agree. This isn't something that needs trimming around the edges. Next up?
