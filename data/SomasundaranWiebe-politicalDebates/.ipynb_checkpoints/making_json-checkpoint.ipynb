Intelligent design is just another theory, a theory of evolution by means of intelligent design (the proponents accept change has occurred and that natural selection occurs at species level),  They have failed to provide any evidence whatsoever for ID.  What would be proof?  Well, it would have to be a big jump in evolution, perhaps something like a fossil rabbit in Jurassic rocks along with dinosaur fossils, something showing that large and unexpected changes have occurred.  One theory doesn't become true just because your incredulity makes it difficult to accept other theories.  The theories you want to favour have to have some (any???) facts supporting them.\",\n",

       "  'Since there is no scientific evidence to prove a \"god\\'s\" existence, and most stories and ideas about \"god\" have been proven wrong over the course of history, it is safe to say that there more than likely is no \"god,\" and if there is, he, she or it likely doesn\\'t care about humanity. Therefore it is detrimental for societies to believe in \"god\" for 2 main reasons: 1: It gives people who \"speak for god\" absolute power and infallibility in the eyes of their followers, and 2: It causes people to react based on emotions as opposed to reason.1. Those who believe that their leaders are under \"god\\'s\" guidance and are therefore all powerful and infallible put themselves under the yoke of authoritarianism. Though authoritarianism can be achieved without belief in \"god,\" religion is certainly a tool in the authoritarian arsenal as either a means of oppression, i.e: the Spanish Inquisition; or as a means of persecution, i.e: Soviet Russia/Nazi Germany. Erasing \"god\" from the minds of people allows them more freedom in their thoughts and actions. It should be up to the individual to decide what his or her personal moral boundaries and beliefs are. People should not be influenced by religion or \"god\" because they end up supporting what they are told to support as opposed to what they would support on their own.2. Belief in \"god\" causes people to respond to difficult situations with emotion rather than logic, i.e: the Crusades/ fundamentalist Islamic terrorist organizations. Though not all conflicts stem from beliefs in \"god,\" many do, and the world would be better off with fewer reasons for people to fight. Karl Marx said that religion is the opium of the people. It causes the individual to feel a certain way without taking into account his or her personal opinions. It gives people ideas for irrational plans in dealing with their problems as opposed to logical problem solving strategies. Islamic terrorism is a great example. Much of the animosity Muslim extremists feel towards the West is due to the West\\'s support of Israel. They fight back with car bombs and suicide bombers, when peace talks would be much more effective in supporting their case.',\n",

There are cases all over the world of such claims, all of them disproven.  You want to believe that you have been touched by him, so the brain simulates your desire.  A simple psychosomatic reaction. Cases have been so extreme as to induce \"stigmata\", Christ-like wounds upon believers.  I have no problem with people accepting the possibility that either religion or science is the answer, but people like this, the ones who deny any other reasoning, who make pathetic arguments for their side, despite tangible evidence of any kind, that really grate on me.

There is still much to learn.  To learn it, we certainly should put aside ancient myths.  Mysticism always leads to brutality. Faith and force go together.  Those not dedicated to reason seek to force others to believe as they do. Religion is an immoral institution and it starts with the notion that some omnipotent, infallible god in on somebody\\'s side and others must be forced to believe it.  Consider the Crusades, the Inquisition, the witch hunts and today\\'s latest \"fad\" suicide bombers.  All these kill themselves and others in the name of their god. No, Virginia, there is no God.

It's human nature to believe so. It's just that as time progressed, we realized that there really isn't a god for everything, like in polytheistic religions. Instead, we have God who watches over us. He allows the world to run on its own and makes sure good things come out of evil acts. And what else would compel people to do good.

Imagine a string pulled from New York to Las Angeles.  Now imagine a pin inserted in that string somewhere in the middle, say Nebraska.  That pin is to represent this earth life.  The possibility of eternal life back in our heavenly home is an \"actual implication\" and a very important one.    I am Christian and therefore, an \"actual implication\" is the importance of the vicarious sacrifice of Jesus Christ; the great and last sacrifice.  To me the existence of God is tied directly to Jesus Christ.  This is vitally important because of the next point.I personally think one reason in the doubt concerning our Heavenly Father\\'s existence is his communication with man sometimes being overlooked.  Yes He could, in a booming voice, speak to all nations and there would be none left with excuse (believe it or not, that day is coming).  However, instead He calls Holy and True Prophets such as the ones we read of in the Holy Bible.  If He had ever called a Prophet, he will continue to call Prophets.  There is a true Prophet of God on earth today.  No, not the kind that mutter blabberings in downtown New York, or the kind that make people drink purple koolaid.  There are, and have been, many prophets that have led souls unto God and to His will; which is to trust in Him (in word, and ACTION [Faith]), to come to know His begotten son Jesus Christ, to repent (change, turn from sin or unjustice), to pray to Him, and follow the path that would lead back to His presence and to receive as a \"...joint heir with Christ...\"  (Rom 8:16)The implication of Gods existence is this:  if we believe in God means we must allow Him to become involved in our lives, changing it, giving specific commandments, approving or disapproving. While He that believes not, keeps God distant; \"out of their Hair\".  Forget everything I\\'ve said, kneel down right now and ask God, our Heavenly Father, out loud, if he exists and what you\\'d do differently if He did.  I promise you that if you ask with Trust (you will act upon the answer He gives you), being sincere of Heart, He will answer you.  He did for me so clearly and far beyond sight that I am left with no doubt.  Thats the test; far better that seeking an answer from man.  Because those answers change; He remains constant.  If he does remain constant, thats another important implication for you.  Boy, do I get excited about this topic.  Just try the experiment, let God enter.     ',\n",

What we need to know is that GOD is so much much bigger (beyond our imagination) than what we can think of. We cannot limit GOD with our (limited and simple) mind. GOD creates everything, there is no way that the created being can think about the CREATOR. In a simple analogy we can put it this way, a computer programme cannot explain about the programmer unless the programmer put it in the programme he or she wrote. The same way is with our GOD, unless GOD reveals to us (humankind), there is no way we know or understand about GOD. The other thing that we need to know, we live in a different dimension from GOD. For this reason we cannot enter the other dimensions. Talking about poverty, sickness and all the problems in this world we cannot avoid not to talk about sins. To explain about this we need to refer to the original sin (as what is written in the Bible in the book of Genesis). As we know, GOD so loves the world that HE has given HIS only begotten Son to die for humankind. From here we can see that GOD wants every single human being to be saved from \"the dead\" (eternal separation from GOD). When GOD walked on this earth in form of humankind like us, HE also experienced all the sufferings known to this world. So, HE perfectly knows about this. Another thing we need to know is that life is more than \"walking\" on this planet (which is only a very small fraction of the \"real\" life - in the life after). After all if we really want to know about GOD, we simply need to ask GOD to reveal HIMSELF to us so that we can understand what is beyond our (limited and simple) mind.By the way, if you are interested in knowing about this futher, based on my experience, there is an excellent book that explain clearly. The name of the book is \"The Progress of Redemption: The Story of Salvation from Creation to the New Jerusalem\" by Willem Vangemeren (you can look at the internet).Finally, what I can say, if we really ask and humble ourselves, GOD will definitely reveal HIMSELF to us in HIS own way.',\n",

It seems as the belief in God for the greater good is correlated with the belief that human beings are evil and that have no potential to do good unless they have some belief in a supernatural force. Contradictorily, most religions are based upon the notion that man is a \"fallen\" creature that needs to be redeemed through rituals, or some sort of metaphysical connection to a higher being. Religion and the belief in God are sustained by the thought that we are evil. The situation we are in right now religions have preeminence in dictating moral standards. Thus, the basis for our understanding of human nature comes from the religious basis that we need some sort of enlightment or redemption to be restored to a higher plane. In this situation the only way to achieve a greater good is through God. thus when yuo say \"people turn to atheism and do what they want,\" you are assuming that this means they will turn into some sort of savages. This is not true. This is just based on your conception of human nature which comes from religion. I would like to see an interpretation of human nature that is not based on religious premises.

       "  'Contrary to the attempts of the religious to make an epistemological equivalence between naturalism and supernaturalism as equally arguable hypotheses to explain nature, there is no such thing as a presumption of naturalism.You are a human being.  You have a definite nature, possessing specific characteristics and capabilities, including a human means of gaining knowledge of the world in which you exist.  This includes seeing by means of looking with one\\'s eyes...and so on for all the senses we possess...and a rational capacity to identify things by their fundamental characteristics and to form concepts in order to hold our knowledge indefinitely.We are not anything but human beings and, thus, have no other means of gaininging knowledge of the world than our human means.So, if you open your eyes and see nature, that\\'s where your knowledge begins.  There is no mental blank until you first choose your starting assumptions.  There are no assumptions that nature, which you see, is nature and that you, somehow, choose to see it onlly in a natural way.Nope. No presumptions whatsoever.  You open your eyes, you see what\\'s there and you begin to mentally organize the evidence provided by your senses into groupings accourding to similarities and differences.You don\\'t start building your knowledge with nature because you chose that as your presumption.  You start building your knowledge with nature, because that is what is there.To go the bizarre and cogintively misguided direction of attributing things that are there to supernatural, meaning unobservable, causes, is what requires an extra action of choosing an assumption, one which veers away from what you observe.  Notice that all arguments for the existence of God or for any version of the supernatural require a very abstract organization of concepts and, upon examination, it turns out that there are NO observations which bear out that presumption, nor do the abstract arguments hold to the tests of logic.So, naturalism is nothing more than human beings gaining knowledge of nature by human means, without a naturalist presumption.  It is supernaturalism which requires the contruction of a presumption in order to selectively bring observables to the task of proving what is not a valid idea nor an observable reality.Notice that this argument against the \"presumption of naturalism\" argument required nothing more than the fact that you exist with a specific nature as a human being, including a specific capacity for gaining knowledge.  If you wish to quarrel with my argument, you must deny those facts about your existence.',\n",

And I had all the arguments down pat for his non-existence. But something kept bugging me. You see, God was \"calling\" me. He doesn\\'t \"call\" on everyone, but any of you that think about this discussion seriously and have ever wonderedÑconsider yourself \"called\"... I did my research (being the \"logical\" person I was), and in the process He revealed Himself to meÑwhich coincided with my research. Here was \"THE truth\" I\\'d always hungered for.

They killed Jesus because he was trying to teach people what it means to care.

What I\\'ve said is, throughout numerous debates, is that I\\'ve done my homework from the time I was an atheist, studied the world religions and what other religions are missing is consistency in creation and faith and reason. I have not found this to be so with Christianity.That is an excellent question about the Native Americans. I am part Indian. As I said, God reveals himself to all in numerous ways. The Bible says \"all have sinned\" (Rom 3:23). Native Americans were involved in sinful practices long before the white man came along, as was the white man long before coming to America. Furthermore, Native culture is loaded with occult beliefs and practices, including the worship of rocks, trees and sky and of the spirits that allegedly live in these things: worship of the creation instead of the Creator. And if they could worship these things, they could have worshipped Him in faith. And many have and do today. But don\\'t misunderstand: God needs to open our spirit to be able to respond to the gospel. There won\\'t be a single person eternally separated from God (\"damned\") who can say \"I really wanted to be saved but wasn\\'t given the chance\". God is an all-knowing, loving and just God. Visit www.h-net.org/~west/threads/disc-smallpox.html  for further information on the possible smallpox spread by Europeans to Indians via infected blankets. Since I cannot possibly know for sure without having been there if the disease was spread intentionally by the white man to hurt Indians (there are differing accounts), I cannot judge whether Amherst\\'s claim is true or not. But know this: God will not be fooled. Jesus did not come out of hate, but out of love. If people used His name to intentionally cause their suffering or deaths, they would be judged accordingly. Jesus says, ÒBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheepÕs clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I NEVER KNEW YOU: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.Ó (Matt 7:15-23).There are saved Protestants and unsaved Protestants, saved Catholics and unsaved Catholics, saved Baptists and unsaved Baptists, etc. (see above). All basically adhere to the Nicene Creed and respect and love one another. If a Christian\\'s faith in God through the Nicene Creed\\'s basic tenants is genuine, then they will see the face of God. If, according to the Bible, people add to the Bible or attempt to rewrite it or redefine its fundamental principles (of which most of the Christian denominations do agree on), then they do not actually believe in the God of the BibleÑthen they have created their own god (idolatry).One (just one) of Christianity\\'s goals is to make people like Christ, who was, by all recorded accounts, the most moral person that ever walked the planet. However, as I\\'ve pointed out a number of times, man is fallen, and there is evil in the world. Christians are just as susceptible to it as non-believers. Please, please don\\'t write off Christianity because of hate groups like the KuKluxKlan or Fred Phelps groupÑneither of whom understand the Gospel as displayed by their fruits. Writing authentic Christianity off because of horrible actions by groups like those is like saying some white men have murdered people, therefore all white men are murderers, or some black men robbed a grocery store, therefore all blacks are thieves. Which is obviously illogical and untrue. Those kinds of groups do not represent me or most Christians.I\\'m sorry you think my view of the world is simplistic.

I would submit that most every mass murderer in the history of the world had some belief in some god, so this entire statement is simply incorrect.But the worst thing is that our lives become pointless and without meaning or value. If we come from nothing and return to nothing, folks we are nothing. Our lives have no value. Then there is no difference between gassing termites and gassing 6 million Jews.Again, as one who does not believe in any god whatsoever, I can promise from experience that I still find plenty of points to continue living. And again, it makes those lives lost even more tragic as I\\'m pretty sure they\\'re just dead, and not floating around somewhere as magical spirits.That ought to scare any sane person. Because then you become a commodity for the state to use and consume for it\\'s purposes. There is a correlation between Communism and atheism. For further proof pick up a copy of The Guinness Book of World Records and check out the greatest mass murderers of all time: Atheistic regimes, Stalin, Mao etc etc. There is a reason Russia is experiencing a surge in religion. This question is not a theoretical one for them; they know the answer from first hand experience.That\\'s just dumb. I am firmly against communism, as atheist as I am. Further, Hitler referred to himself as an Evangelical in his speeches on Mien Kempf. The crusades killed around 6 million people (5 million in the first four and another 1 million in the Albigensian Crusade.) Terrorism from the middle east is under the banner of religion, as is much of the ethnic cleansing in Africa. Of the two; god\\'s hands are far bloodier than any atheist\\'s. I do however think the greater question is why do we have to protect ourselves from ourselves. Take the Ten Commandments, it ought to stagger us that God has to tell us not to murder and steal. Wow!!Agreed. Did it ever occur to you that god had nothing to do with the ten commandments? But that some smart person said, \"these people are idiots, we need to figure out some way to control them.\" This sounds more like an argument for education than against atheism.that ought to be a given. We shouldn\\'t have to be told not to do those things. And then to be threatened with punishment knowing we will do those things.Agreed. And again, of the 18% of the human population that identifies them self as atheist or agnostic, you will find about the same proportion within that population as in the religious population who follow the relevant commandments such as don\\'t kill and steal, all without the fear of eternal damnation.Something is amiss at the very core of who we are. Laws can\\'t help us because as soon as they get in the way of what we want, they get broke. And it\\'s painfully obvious religion can\\'t help either; it just becomes a facade we hide behind to justify our actions. Others simply turn to atheism, they close their eyes, cross their fingers and hope no one is home in the universe and proceed to do what they want, when they want. Others still will try to plead ignorance: \" I really want to do this and If there is a God I\\'ll just tell Him that I didn\\'t know that it was wrong\"So you\\'re saying, it doesn\\'t matter if someone believes in a god or not, they\\'re going to do what they do. Agreed again, so how is this an argument for god being for the greater good? It would seem to be an argument for it not mattering... which happens to be a very atheist and free-thinking argument by the way. Odd... btw, I\\'m not crossing my fingers and hoping no one is home. That\\'s a ridiculous view of atheism.Folks, we need to be saved from ourselves, we are the problem.

In my conception of a greater good I am assuming this means to uphold certain values, such as truthfulness, and thus I put this as an example. Sorry if that was not clear, perhaps you can clarify, what the greater good is and how we can identify what it is. Also, when you say that we shouldn\\'t bring religion into the debate you must first explain why on your introduction to the debate you have us imagine that we are creating a religion. We should first agree on whether or not religion is an obligatory vehicle for a belief in God. It seems to me that in your argument followers of a god want to find ways to please this god, and thus will be compelled to follow rules. People can either then follow established religions or create personal \"guidelines\" and \"rules\" of their own, and this becomes their religion. What benefit can there be to society where people are creating their own guidelines to follow based on a subjective understanding of a God? Some people may say my god requires me to dance naked in the middle of the street and then... what is the benefit to society? Either way, as you say, without bringing religion into the question (or pretending to create a religion), there are many people out there, agnostics for example, who do believe in a creator but not necessarily some creator who wants anything from them... a god that is more of a passive uninvolved observer, than a ruler. These people thus, have no need to \"please\" him or follow \"his\" rules. And it doesnt mean that they people are lawless savages. The ability to understand what is good and bad for society, as I have mentioned before, has nothing to do with the belief in having a god to please or fear.

While atheism is not of itself a sin leadng to death it is a porthole to evil and a wise person would not go there! Here is a review of her book: This book is a sequel to the much talked about book, HE CAME TO SET THE CAPTIVES FREE, by physician Rebecca Brown. Some would call her a extreme right wing religious fanatic others downright crazy but those who have encountered the rituals and practices of satanists and those who have experienced demonic and satanic activity within the witchcraft or satanic underground would beg to differ with those evaluations. Many more people than you would think have dabbled and even practiced witchcraft and even lesser evils, be it for pleasure or for serious worship and have found this underworld to be wicked and criminal in more ways than one and have little resource as to how to get out of such a mind-controling anti-religious group/groups and Dr. Brown attempts to show people what that world does to innocent victims and how it operates and how unknowing youth are falling into its spiritual warfare and are finding it to be a battle they dont know how to win or even begin to fight against. Dr. Brown shows those individuals that they can leave satan worship and they can only do that by the blood of Jesus and the grace of Gd. She effectively educates the reader on how to avoid these pitfalls and how to pull oneself out of the mire of them and back onto solid and peaceful ground once again. I give this book at 3.5 for her sincerity and conviction to help those caught in the pits of hell on earth. Some will laugh at her efforts, some will scoff at her remarks, but I guarantee you that anyone who has experienced even one of the portals to hell that she exposes will not only understand her but appreciate her willingness to endure ridicule inorder to SET THE CAPTIVES FREE and do that by teaching them to PREPARE FOR WAR. end quoteIm pretty sure that should annoy some   atheists   while I dont know why, they dont believe in Gd so they cant believe in satan, they dont believe in heaven so therefore according to them there is no hell, according to them they have nothing to worry about then!

I find the deist point of view more rational than the majority of theist thoughts.The problem is that all the devices you use do it; reason, logic, your mind, thought, reflection, moral assessments etc. and the morality, ethics, rules etc you come up with are not characteristics of matter nor are they physical in nature. Okay, this is like St. Anselm\\'s Ontological theory. It was supposed to basically be a one page strictly cerebral proof of the existence of some god. It takes a similar premise which I think is provable, that humans are incapable of creation. Every idea we have comes from something we observe; and you can try if you like, it\\'s kind of fun, attempt to imagine something new, a new fantastic creature perhaps, you\\'ll find no matter how crazy an idea you come up with, it can be traced to things observed piece by piece. Everything is an exaggeration, or a combination of things etc, but it\\'s all traceable to the real world.He took this basic fact of the human mind, and put forth the idea that man long ago came up with this idea of something \"greater than which nothing else can exist.\" Since this is an ephemeral thought, and in itself it would seem to be untraceable, man must on some level have experience of it. Therefore, \"something than which nothing else can exist\" must be real. And this we call god, and then of course there\\'s a million definitions and theories about this being, but at the center it must be based on some unknowable truth.He studied philosophical works, especially Socrates and Plato of course, and very much seemed to be influenced by the very persuasive argument that we exist with all knowledge in some form before birth, and at birth, we somehow forget, and learning is simply memory. It seems to be the same kind of thought process.Which is interesting.But my reply is simply. 1. in response to St. Anselm, we cannot really imagine \"something than which nothing greater can exist\" we simply exaggerate on to infinity, and describe it as such. Ex. I can say \"infinity\" referring to say just numbers. But I know that there is no such thing because one can always add a 0 at the end. At the same time, while I can say infinity, and can have a general concept of the idea while at the same time knowing it is not a real thing, really I cannot even begin to imagine really large numbers. No one can really imagine for example how many a trillion is. We hear that number all the time, but the reality is beyond our comprehension when converted to anything real. Yet, a trillion does not even begin to approach \"infinity\" and in fact, we run into the number \"trillion\" all the time, in the deficit, the number of stars, sand on the beach, etc. It\\'s everywhere. But beyond our comprehension none the less.Now that obviously could be turned into a pretty sermon about god, how something can be in front of us, while we do not comprehend it.lol, and I just realized how cute a point that would be. Probably make a million turning it into a little poem or something - \"foot prints in the sand\" and all that :)but the point is, our ability to have what seem to be higher-level thoughts, \"reason, logic, your mind, thought, reflection, moral assessments etc. and the morality, ethics, rules etc\" as you say,are very much characteristics of matter and are I believe of a physical nature.So, 2. In response to your point I would say that these things are a part of the natural world. reason, logic, reflection, ethics, even the morality that began this entire sideline to the debate, are all things I believe that developed naturally in humans, and many many mammals with relatively large brains, from observing the benefits of this kind of social behaviour.A chimpanzee can learn (From \"Bonobo: the forgotten ape\") for example, that if he brings a lover food, she will have sex with him later. When he does not, she does not. So they learned to share. Even in them, this took a certain amount of reflection. These primates had to look at them self, and on some level say \"I want sex\" then, their actions in pursuit of what they determined through self-reflection appears, and may well be, morality.Through time, we observe the fruits of our actions both from our own experience, and with our capacity to imagine what others have experienced. This leads over hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, experience, breeding with those who act in a similar way, etc, generation after generation, to a people (us) who appear to have a capacity for morality, reflection, moral judgment,when the hundreds of thousands of years of the trial and error of evolution are not taken into consideration,I admit it can appear quite miraculous, and I can see how one may feel something \"greater\" must be an architect of sorts. Even if this architect isn\\'t really around to talk to like deists believe.But given the progression over generations. I don\\'t feel these higher-level human characteristics necessitate the existence of a greater being. Sure, they are not \"characteristics of matter nor are they physical in nature.\" But they are results of physical nature, hundreds of thousands of years of physical nature.Now, to the debate. \"Is belief in God for the GREATER GOOD.\"I do not believe it is. We are capable of all the good, and all the evil on our own, with or without a god. And I do not like one using god as an excuse for good or for evil. I believe it is people, always was people, and always will be people, and it is better to be aware of that even if it should be the case that people couldn\\'t handle this idea. I think though they could handle it just fine though if t hey tried.',\n",

This is just dumb, because the only people espousing the existance of a god are of one religion or another, and there is no religion that does not change, just as laws change, so my point is incredibly valid, regardless of which religion\\'s version of the \"word of god\" I use as an example.At the end of the day, it\\'s just people.And yeah, I think people who think they hear the word of god are usually schizos of con-artists, because he\\'s not real, therefore they\\'re hearing voices or just making stuff up.',\n",

       "  'There is something I would like to share with you in relation to the existence of GOD and the validity of the Bible. It is interesting to learn that until today the extinction of dinosaurs is still a big mystery to human race. There are so many theories suggested regarding this mass extinction; such as the climate changes, a big asteroid fell to the Earth, etc. In fact, if we look at the Source of the History itself, we will definitely find the answer to this question. Actually, back then in the time of dinosaur, the whole Earth (without exception) was covered by the cloud (waters) (GENESIS1:7) to protect it from direct exposure or radiation of the Sun. This cloud functioned as a filter and Òtemperature stabilizerÓ (like having central air condition in a house) for the Earth. As a result, the whole Earth had the same temperature everywhere (whether in the North Pole, South Pole or the Equator - the temperature were the same). Due to this condition, the vegetation and environment in those days were very different from what it is now. The Land was much larger and bigger than the Sea (not like today) so as to accommodate and support the lives of so many giant creatures like dinosaurs on Earth. The question is, how did they become extinct all of the sudden (not even a single one exists but the bones and skeletons)? If there was a major catastrophe struck the Earth, then how come humankind and small animals could survive? If there was only a certain part of the Earth was hit by a meteorite or an asteroid, then how come ÒallÓ the dinosaurs disappeared but not other creatures?If we look back at the History of the Earth (as told in the Oldest History book, the Bible), there was a certain time when there was a great flood took place on Earth. How could this happen? This could happen because the Dome of the Clouds above the Earth had been torn out and fell down in form of a big rain flooding and submerging all over the Earth (which was in NoahÕs time). As a result, the amount of water on the surface of the Earth had increased dramatically and formed what is called the Ocean. From this time on the size of the Water area has become much larger and bigger than the Land area. And at the same time the Earth has become too exposed to the radiation from the Sun which has increased the EarthÕs temperature drastically from what it used to be (which has left it without Òtemperature stabilizerÓ). From this time on, the temperatures in the North Pole, South Pole and Equator are quite different because they depend on the rotation of the Sun (just like in an air conditioned house when the doors and the windows are wide opened, certain places or rooms in the house have become too hot than the others). The same with the dinosaurs (if any of them survived from the flood), which used to live in a temperate world and environment, suddenly with the climatic changes had become too fragile and died out. Even for us today, with only a slight change in temperature due to the change of the seasons (from warm summer to cold winter) prone to get flu and other types of diseases, not to mention a drastic climatic change for dinosaurs which used to live in a temperate world. Consistent with the History as told in the Bible, only Noah and his family and all the passengers in the Ark were survived to live in the ÒNewÓ Earth. And for the first time they could see the blue sky right after the Dome of the Clouds had been torn down in form of a big rain which caused the big flood. Before the flood there had never been any rain on Earth because the temperature on Earth was stable and the same everywhere under the Dome of the Cloud. This is proved by the Rainbow which was the first time showing as a sign after the flood. Based on this it confirms that there was no rain before this time because rainbows will only appear as the droplets of water reflecting the light.Before the big flood took place (when the Dome of the Clouds was still intact), the age of the creatures was longer than today (they could live up to hundreds of years).The ancestors of Noah lived up to hundreds of years (according to the Oldest History book or the Bible).This could happen only because there was no radiation (from the Sun) which has caused aging process. In conclusion, all these things show to us the validity of what is written in the ÒOldest History BookÓ or the Bible.

Our relationship continues on the basis of that mutual trust. That trust is it own reward. If we want God's benefits, it's only consistent with all other things in life that he should ask us to accept him by faith. He has offered himself as the reward of the one who will seek to know him by faith. It's a fair deal, and a very good one. No one is forced in. And he isn't trying to fill heaven by coercion. It's for the willing.Lately, the thing which has me awestruck is God's love of paradox (apparent contradictions that seem impossible, yet with a change of viewpoint, they resolve).

       "  'You asked a couple of good questions.  Let\\'s see if I can give you some good answers. First, regarding conviction and belief. You wrote: \"Right now I sit in a chair, convinced it will hold me up. I\\'ve never studied a chair I don\\'t know exactly why or how long chairs will hold people up, but I believe that I am safe. So I think that conviction and belief are closer and strongly related than you might suppose.\"   It\\'s quite okay to say that you \"believe\" a chair will hold you up. Most of our convictions are subconscious evaluations formed many years ago and they\\'ve become automatized. We\\'ve had countless experiences since childhood that when we can sit in a chair it will hold us up. From those experiences we\\'ve formed evaluations which in time have become firm convictions.  It\\'s okay to use the term \"believe\" in this manner. It\\'s not precise, but most people know what you mean. In everyday talk, we often use the two concepts interchangeably. However, in serious discussions I like to be more precise simply because to do so usually results in easier and quicker mutual understanding.But the two concepts are very different, for the reason I previously stated. In a serious discussion we make ourselves almost instantly understandable by your saying, for example, you believe in God and for me to say I am convinced God does not exist. The bonus in this is that we both see we have different viewpoints---or as is said these days, \"we know where the other is coming from.\" Were each of us to use the same term, confusion would immediately result. And it would take us several hours, maybe days, to sort out what each mean. Your reference to bungee jumping is pretty much the same idea but using a different example. Many people go through their entire lives wishing things were so, or believing something is safe. That does not alter the nature of the intellectual methodology of belief and its distinct difference from conviction.   The other question you asked was: \"What would you define as true happiness?\"  Novelist/philosopher Ayn Rand wrote: \"Happiness is the successful state of life, pain is an agent of death.  Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one\\'s values.\"  This must be understood in the context of her philosophy, Objectivism.  Miss Rand is referring to values that are in accordance with man\\'s rational nature, fundamental values such as reason, purpose and self-esteem from which other values such as the choice of one\\'s career, the type of art one enjoys, the qualities of character one esteems in others, and so forth.  She is NOT referring to those who claim a \"value\" in taking mind-destroying drugs, or sexual promiscuity or hedonism.  If one holds values in accordance with man\\'s rational nature and seeks to achieve them, when one does so, one certainly experiences a state of happiness.  For example, say you want very much to find a life-partner. You think about what you want in a partner. You don\\'t sit at home and mope. You go out and look around and meet different people and find what you want or something very close to it and you become friends with that person.  Surely you\\'ve achieved a value.  And surely that achievement will make you happy. I mentioned that achieving happiness begins with rejecting a religious moral code. You wrote: \"For my religion (Christianity) that would mean rejecting love, obedience to authority, unselfishness, etc. Good things in my opinion, and yours too I would think.\"I think love is very good. I also think that love is not possible for those who believe in God.  I think that those who value love as you say you do, do so on my code of values, not on the Christian code of values.  I think \"obedience to authority and unselfishness\" are very bad things.  I think both are mind-destroying and spiritual suicide. Many Americans have a mixed set of values. One set of values is based on a rational code of morality that they\\'ve never discovered. Another set of their values are based on Christianity, which continuously erodes their rational code of morality.  Ayn Rand has identified the rational code of morality.  It is a code of morality based on man\\'s nature as a basically good and valuable entity, with a rational faculty that can be his most glorious asset, if he chooses to use it.I cannot promise you to read Mere Christianity. I\\'ve read many books on Christianity and the other religions of the world.I\\'m delighted to hear that you will read Ayn Rand\\'s novels, particularly Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead. ',\n",

Because with that knowledge you would know the reaction to your action 100%.When religious people seek answers in prayer, the answer has a high chance of just being a subjective personal intuition. If religious people would really look for answers they would have to start by first questioning the very existence of god, and requiring proof.Ofcourse it MIGHT be subjective personal intuition. Someone would only every give their opinion. If somebody came and asked you about God, don\\'t tell me you\\'d say He exists... or give strong points to His existance.

Let's put it like this.A mother taking her kid for a walk. The kid keeps falling over and cries until the mother picks the kid up and lets her continue to walk. The mother and child are both happy and everytime the child falls, the mother picks the child up.A mother taking her kid for a walk. The kid keeps falling over and cries, but the mother does not pick the kid up. Its cold and unloving, but the mother will not help. Everytime the child falls, the mother only watches.The first mother's child never learns to pick itself up and one day on its own, when it fell, it never got back up. The second child however had learnt how to get back up and on its own was able to continue in life.The second one is the greater good. The mother may seem insensitive and harsh at first, but in the long run, the outcome led to the child's survival. This may seem like an obvious and maybe even biased example, but that is what I mean by the greater good.explain why on your introduction to the debate you have us imagine that we are creating a religion. Read it. It said look at it from this point of view. I haven't brought religion, its values, its history or its rules or stories. Just one of God's roles.What benefit can there be to society where people are creating their own guidelines to follow based on a subjective understanding of a God?Let me name you 5 prophets. Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Muhammed.These people are not creating their own guidelines, but are taking God's Word. Not their understanding, but word for word, God's Words. Over time however Jesus's words have been distorted (as an example) which is not God or Jesus's fault but those who have distorted their word. They are the true prophets. There are several others, but you wouldn't have heard of them. Elron Hubbard is not a prophet, so his followers DO believe in crap and are NOT a benefit to society. But realistically, all religions all in all follow similar rules and these similar rules have nothing stupid.The systematized rules that you mention, come from religion, NOT a belief in god.Ok good point. Especially with the Agnostic part. However earlier I've explained earlier that the systematized rules come from God. But we're not here to talk about the differences in those rules. Just that God HAS given Rules to us. Let's not argue about which one is correct.. that is for a different debate. These rules are for us to follow for the good of mankind. How do we know it's for the good of mankind? Because God gave it to us. God, who is all knowing, all powerful etc. THAT is why we know it is right and if we followed them, we would be living in paradise.IMO agnostics are just confused. They aren't sure on what God wants etc. I'll come to this later. (Remind me)...May I ask you why you believe that people are not able to figure things out on their own?If people were able to figure things out on their own, we wouldn't have any rules etc. The reason we have the law is to guide people. The MAJORITY. How many people out there CAN actually run the country, make all the perfect laws etc? Only God's word is right, because God is perfect only He can make the correct decision.You say that religion should not take the blame for a lot of the ills in society, but look how far religion has come and yet it doesn't seem we are learning how to get along. Maybe it is time to let people figure things out, and see what happens instead of getting stuck in the idea that people need some mythical being to tell them what to do.Again it is not religion which is in the wrong. Religion does say not to kill, drink etc. yet that is what you're saying is wrong. It's not religion that caused crusades. It was religion that was USED. Most wars etc. aren't fought for over religion, but merely use religion as an excuse to get people drawn into it.Maybe it is time to let people figure things out, and see what happens instead of getting stuck in the idea that people need some mythical being to tell them what to do.This is my problem. I have seen all around me what has happened due to the lack of religion. You tell me the problems in todays societies and then tell me is that due to the lack of religion or because of religion.

Whereas before people had to be threatened with floods and the wrath of a god to compel them to change their ways, now that we have more understanding about the world, we are able to find logical conclusions as to how we should act in certain situations. we are now able to think more critically about issues because we have more knowledge. Regarding the questions you post on the thou shalt not kill example, using the concept of god inhibits our critical thinking about how to solve such situations. The \"word of god\" is usually not enough to address such issues about euthanasia, abortion in case of rape, killing in war, or self defense. I seriously doubt that god will tell us the right answer no matter what. Whereas we can be allowed to arrive at logical conclusions about the issues of killing on a case to case basis, I dont think that we can know god\\'s answers about these issues based on things that were written hundreds of years ago. Unless, again, you can prove that you have a direct line to god and that he is telling you what to do. This would be very subjective and you would have a hard time applying it to all of society. There was a case in Nicaragua a couple of years ago, where an 11 year old girl was raped, and because she had reached puberty, she got pregnant. In Nicaragua, people believe that the bible is the word of god. Churches of different denominations interpret this word for the people. However, the god had not mentioned anything about what to do in this situation... no mention of abortion. So churches, who claimed to know what god was saying, launched a fierce campaign against the abortion of the child... based on the fact that if the bible (the word of god) said thou shalt not kill then this applies in any situation and we shouldn\\'t think critically about each issue and respond to it accordingly. The girl was 11 years old and incapable of taking care of the baby. The family of the girl lost the support of the community because they wanted the daughter to abort. The girl did not even understand what was going on. .... Anyway, just an example of how claiming that god says something can not be for the greater good. If the girl asks why she shouldn\\'t be allowed to abort the answer will be because god says so. This kind of answer in itself is detrimental to the advancement of our own development of ethics and morality.I don\\'t claim that educated people make good choices all the time, only that when we have more knowledge about situations, our choice will be more informed and this expands the possibility that it will be a better choice than an uninformed one. If we become more informed then we will solve the problem of just being like children who do not understand and need to follow blindly . This may have been the case in times when people thought that the world stood on pilars, but now we don\\'t need more myths, we need more education so we can think critically about the impact of our desicions.',\n",

I gather this from your refutal from my use of mass suicides and cult-like belief as examples. I really dont see why they shouldn\\'t be used as examples in an argument about god - supposing you are just talking about any conceptions of god - . I first argued that it is not for the greater good, because there is the possibility to come up with a lot of conceptions about what god is, how to follow him, how to please him. An example of this are cults. The conceptions range from crazy to crazier. And first we would have to find a way to prove that one conception is the correct one. However you seem to believe that the abrahamic god is the correct one. how can you prove that? Heaven\\'s gate followers had a different conception and they died for it, their beliefs were passionate and convinced. They would have argued for their own view as passionately as someone who wants to believe that the abrahamic god is real and necessary for society. so the first problem is how to find a god that is for the greater good? religion is just as subjective as any opinion in this world. facts on the other hand, are not subjective. if people are given access to facts about situations, it is easier to make better decisions about right and wrong. if we knew the facts about the existence of a soul or not, we would know when consciousness actually begins, and this would help us in deciding whether or not abortion is right, or from when could it be right. does that makes sense? we kill cells every day and we dont feel like murderers. but because right now we do not know yet how to define \"life\", we continue with this myth of \"god created life by breathing his spirit into us\" and then we find this answer more satisfactory than the incomplete scientific search for life... up to now i think it is safer to say, \"i dont know\" than to argue that some god has answers.

All of the energy there caused it to explode and from there, galaxies and solar systems were born.Where did the small piece of matter come from? or Why did the Big Bang happen?If you can logically come up with a scientific answer to this, then you are absolutely amazing. How can everything come from nothing? Unless.... God made it! The spiritual being that always was and always will be created everything that never was and will cease to be!',\n",
       "  \"I think we can see this by looking at previous questions which were answered by appealing to the supernatural. In response to the three components:1) Theories of, or beliefs in, a Divine source constitute the longest standing range of explanations for phenomena like weather, disasters, and other events that have natural explanations. Looking historically it is almost certain that far, far, more people have used divinities to explain things like lightning than have used the modern scientific explanation. Even today, it is possible to find people around the world who hold similar beliefs. The mere fact that a certain kind of explanation has been popular doesn't mean that that class of explanations are good or true.2)A similar point goes for #2. I do not see how he could possibly believe point #2 to be relevant. Theories and beliefs of a divine source for the human species likely constitute the most agreed-upon range of explanations believed by human beings, both historically and today. Regardless of what the good Rabbi's view on   evolution   is, he surely doesn't think that the question of whether evolution is true or not can be solved by polling people. It doesn't make any sense to try to determine if evolution is true by counting the number of people who believe it or don't believe it. Why then, would theories about the origin of the universe be any different?3)Even if current (naturalistic) theories about the source of the universe suffer problems, this is no reason to assume that a divinity must be the answer. As I stated in #1, previously unexplainable phenomena were also explained using supernatural beings. The fact that at various points in history humans didn't have a natural explanation didn't make a supernatural explanation the correct answer. I also am curious as to how exactly God is supposed to solve the problem of existence. It only seems to raise the question of why God exists. If we assume that God simply always existed, why can't we assume that the material universe always existed (albeit likely in a rather different form prior to the big bang)? In other words, if existence requires explanation, then God's existence also requires an explanation and simply saying that God always existed answers nothing; if existence doesn't require explanation, then there is no need to appeal to God as an explanatory force at all. \",\n",

Using science as a justification to not believe in God is folly, but those who don't have enough faith to believe won't realize it until it is too late for them.

I support a clear, objective understanding of reality, you clearly don\\'t. You are still hoping that the god you believe in is real in order to base your morality on it. Morality does not require a god. Atheists are not immoral people. Muslims are not immoral people. Buddhist are not immoral. Everyone is capable of understanding and exercising good will towards others (in favor of a greater good), with or without a religious background. What I\\'m saying is, there is no need to believe in god in order to attain a greater good. I still maintain that arguing which religion is right is absurd because it is like arguing about the preferences of santa claus. It is unnecessary. A waste of effort. And unfortunately it further divides us. I know people clash on different subjects, we all have differences.. however religious people tend to view others outside their religion as being inferior, or condemned, or in need. They view themselves as being \"right\" and this hinders communication and dialogue. While two people with differing opinions on politics or philosophy an argue and change their minds and grow; two very firm religious believers will not argue for the sake of developing their ideas. Their aim is to \"convince\" the other person that they need a \"god\". Im very clear in saying that moral choices do not come from fairy tales. They come from judgement based on enough evidence about a situation. When two friends of yours get into a fight and one comes to tell you about the situation, you have the choice to make a judgement without listening to the other side of the story. If you do, your judgement is more likely to be flawed than if you allowed yourself to listen to the other side. The more evidence you have, the better the choice you will make. Religion makes us listen to only one authorative voice, the voice of god (whoever that one is). When I talk about \"evidence\" please do not mistake this only with scientific evidence. When I speak of science I mean using the scientific method of inquiry. Of course moral judgments come outside of science! im not arguing or that or saying contrary. But INFORMED judgments come from more evidence and knowledge. Thats the difference. When I hear \"homosexuality is wrong!\" from a religious person, no one is able to give me one reason between stuttering that doesn\\'t boil down to \"the word of god\". This is an exampled of a moral judgement that is uninformed and inaccurate. I find a lot of contradictions in what you are saying about belief in god. When I mentioned that faith is the certainty of things without the need for evidence, Im not making this up. Go look at the definition of faith in the bible and you will see what many followers already know. Questioning within a religion is not \"wrong\" but it is seeing often as an attack of the devil, a phase, or something that must be overcome. Because eventually, you just gotta believe, brother. or as you mentioned near the end of your post: you just have to trust the imaginary being above. When you say that science does nothing, you sound like a very religious uneducated person. Science does nothing?! geez, now who sounds close minded? A scientific method of reasoning actually tells us to start all inquiries with the premise that we do not know, and thus, we keep on searching. Religious people quit that search and take things by faith, that is, by lack of evidence. Including a lack of proof for the existence of god. If you show an atheist proofs of the existence of god, then it makes sense to believe. But when scientific proof comes out rebutting the possibility of the afterlife, or miracles, or of resurrection , the religious person closes his ears and stops listening. This also occurs when two religious people argue, from different beliefs... why? because they already trust \"in their heart\" so no point in dialoguing in order to find out if what they trust is true or not. Judgement about whether one thing is good or not should come from information. Lets stop calling it science cause you seem to get confuse. In your example about immigration, if your judgement is based on the unfounded belief that people from other countries are inferior, then your judgement will be wrong. However if you judgement is based upon evidence about the effects of immigration on your country (whether good or bad), then you will have a better judgement, and therefore make better laws. Does that make sense? What is the need for a god ideology when in reality better judgement comes from more information? So isn\\'t evidence useful?!? I find it appalling to be arguing with someone who says that science has done nothing, and who sees no point in gathering evidence before making a judgement about a person or a behavior.

What is the definition of the word spirit? It is the thinking, feeling, motivating part of man. Spirits or feelings motivate us to do certain things. Again, the Bible says that \"God IS love\". God IS--is what? LOVE. Is Love a man or a feeling? In another verse it reads, GOOD IS GOD. Are we pronouncing that word God correctly? Is it really pronounced G-odd or is that word really GOOD? The Bible is a spiritual book. It\\'s soul purpose to is convict man of his or her wrong doing in life. The Bible also says it IS the Book of LIFE. That is exactly what it is.

Being this really IS an ambiguous question, if we did this statistically with the world's viewpoint, it'd be what? 90:10? Something of that sort, and thus God exists simply because 90% of the world believes he does. As I said, even though I'm not religious, I spend a lot of my time analyzing the origin of religion and how and why people prefer it so badly. I personally don't think he exists because I overall don't care. I don't see a point to wanting to believe he exists, because I'm completely fine as a human being without his existence to me personally. However, I also think he is merely a mythological creation. We've got all those fairy tales that make up the world of Disney, that are so incredibly famous because they all have one thing in common: a happy ending. And that's why I think people cling to religion like they cling to a good fairy tales... because the idea of death and dying sucks so much, everyone likes the idea of life continuing on... in heaven! The land with no boundaries! But really, in a sense, I'd believe in God the same way I believe in Santa Clause, but I'm too rationalized to see the point in doing so.Also, like someone else said, I believe the idea that the bible and religion were started when they were because perception was limited. In the times of the bible, there's not one mention of the planets, or microorganism, and that was because they were out of their ability to see. Instead, they decided a sickness was granted because of God, or a meteor was punishment because of God. It was an easy way to believe why everything was happening... because of the act of just ONE entity.Now, if anything I said was truly accurate, my only question is why all these religious people don't step out of their boxes and agree with me. But they don't. And that alone makes me question how wrong I could be about it because can 90% of the world really be that... different? That close minded? That much of a follower? But then again, everyone thinks Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth too, so maybe it's a lost cause. 90% of the world just really might be that alike.\",\n",

Likewise you have to have faith in athiesm in order to ignore the evidence and not believe in god. One bit of evidence for God is the creation of the universe. \"the big bang\" theory is generally accepted by scientists today. So all time, space and matter had a beginning at some time in the distant past. Before the big bang there was no time space or matter. Christians say God (an infinate being outside of time space and matter) created something out of nothing. Athiests say nothing created something out of nothing. Both views require some faith, but the christian view makes more logical sense and requires less faith. Creation of life on earth is more evidence that points to god (intelegent design). Athiests, darwinists, evolutionists claim that uninteligent, randomizing nature took dead random matter and mixed it together and first life was born. Then every living thing evolved from that first life. Of corse christians think God created man, the animals, and the vegitation. The fossil records show that all life appeared between 600million and 500million bc, and that all life appeared all at once, fully formed, and showed no directional changes through extinction. The fossil records also do not show any transitional forms to support evolution. Again we cannot go back and witness what happened so some faith is required, but the evidence agrees more strongly with creation rather than evolution/athieism/darwinism.

That\\'s not the case, it gradually developed over a LOOOONG time, and the basic compounds that make us exist all over nature and are generally stable. Ironically, Christians believe that we were pressed from dirt.This eliminates the need for a God to have intervened. Then there is the supposition that a physically impossible being just magically created us, with no possible ability of knowing this except that people from 1000\\'s of years ago who were studying, at best, witchcraft, alchemy, and astrology (not astronomy) were telling the absolute truth when we simultaneously discredit 2,999 other religions based on the very same credibility.This really has nothing to do with facts and evidence at all. We are trapped into believing in God and Heaven because we don\\'t like the alternative of permanent death, that noone is watching over us, and that you\\'ve wasted your life in Church. This principle of \"faith\" is simply the emotional refusal to grasp what appears to be a harsh reality.We live in a very sheltered country of America. I\\'m not cynical, but we swim in water while people in Africa (mostly Christians by the way) are begging for it while being slaughtered, we work effortlessly while near-slaves at home and abroad manufacture our basic goods while we exploit a useless service sector economy.

If God loves us and have the abilty to see the future, why did he create us humans when he knew that we would eventually become bad and punish those bad humans by flooding the land ?If God have the ability to see the future why did he create lucifer when he knew that lucifer one day will betray him and god will punish him by banishing to hell ?And why did god put the tree of 'not sure what is it called'in the garden of Eden where Adam and Mary lived.If he owns the power to create the universe why is he so unwise to put something that would cause Adam to become a so called 'normal'human being ?If god cares for everyone, why did he in the bible say that animals are for humans to consume for food but not kill for fun. Indirectly he is saying that animals are something he created and we can kill for our own advantage. But apparently animals are similar to us human beings too. Animals have feelings like us and they feel pain when the chopper is brought down to their neck. If God is really benevolant to all living things he could just invoke his magic powers and let the animals feel no pain when they are being slaughtererd.But why did he give animals feelings ?And i strongly feel that we humans aren't suppose to consume animals.Our teeth are harbivourous and our digestive system are that of a vegetarian not a meat eater.We can eat meat yes but not too much as when they die, waste materials in the animals such as Urea will be sstored inside them. When we eat them we eat their waste materials.There are so many inperfections of God and i can hardly name them all in one go.Here is my point and question towards those to believe in god.Why did your beloved god create you when he could just not create you and not make you suffer.Another question:Why did god create us in the first place ?To be his puppets ?For fun ?So that god will not feel lonely ?I heard many weird debaters insulting me as an idoit and so on but this is just my views on christianity and gods that create everything.This argument meant no offense to anybody but is just to express my opinions and beliefs.\",\n",

I argue that determining what is \"right\" or \"wrong\" based on belief is inaccurate and subjective. People do things \"because god told me so\" (no matter what god that is) without questioning why or really thinking for themselves. Scientific reasoning (I do not mean just science but perhaps the use of the scientific method) can lead us to find a \"greater good\" in a more objective way. Why is homosexuality wrong? Why is sodomy wrong? A better measure would be to check whether or not your actions are harmful to you or to others, and then measure your behavior accordingly. This is better than just \"god told me to do it\" which leaves the issue open to having any god tell you any kind of crazy thing \"god told me to go kill the abortionists\". There was actually a case a couple of years ago in one state about a pastor who killed a doctor that was performing abortions. And the congregation supported him. Im sure you will say \"well, that is extreme, bla bla bla\" and make some excuse about how those people were not true followers... but the thing is, religion is subjective and it is left to ones \"relationship with god\". How do you explain to that man that killed the abortionist that his relationship with god is not legitimate? How would YOU argue for that? Do you have a direct line to god? things get easier if we have the means to determine whether our behavior is harmful to ourself or others. Now science can tell us a lot about how to behave in ways that are less harmful to ourself, to the environment, and to society in general. The bible does not say anything about protecting the environment, which is an issue of importance to all of us. But in my personal identification of \"right\" and \"wrong\" I say the overuse of pet bottles is wrong, because Ive learned the effects they can have on the environment. - Just an example. What greater goods have come from the belief in God? I want you to explain to me how religion is NOT subjective. When followers have to listen to a pastor/priest interpret things for them.

What you need to understand is that many people really do not want to know the truth because it would require them to do some soul searching of their own. It is easier to blame God for the ills of the world than to research one's soul and take a good hard look at ourselves. How could there be good w/o bad, right w/o wrong, life w/o death? Remember whenever we become full of ourselves we open the door to true evil, Satan. God wants us to love him because we want to, not because we have to, ie free will. In today's   society   too much importance is put on   money   and material things in my humble opinion.  There are people who do not consider themselves poor, although by others standards most likely would be considered poor. If you believe in God, you must also know that Satan is his rival, and will do what it takes to attempt to dehumanize humans in the eyes of other humans. God won't fall for it however many humans will and do. I believe that there are millions of tragedies in this world that could be easily laid at Satan's door. He loves to see people ponder over whether there is a God, it is his mission. We do have choices in this world, whether or not people see that have choices or not is another story. To simply do nothing is a choice, and if Satan can keep us reacting instead of acting, he has us on the fence post. For me God does exist because when I look back over my life, and I see the many times God was there for me when no one else was. It would not have mattered if I had a lot or money or none, because I was in the hospital on machine that was breathing for me. They were pumping me full of morphine/paralytic drugs so I would remain still because I was told I was fighting the machine to breath on my own. It took me 3 months to be able to get my arms, legs, and hands to function properly. I remember walking around in Walmart for 3 hours trying to gain strengh in my legs.  The wonder of it all was I didn't remember hardly any of it, until I was told. What I remembered was praying in a safe place within myself. I saw my life and my loved ones lives and how much I loved them. I spoke with a woman whom I'm told no one ever saw in my room, yet she was with me all the time. I saw good times and sad times, and things I could have done differently in my past, and a chance to do them differently in the future. I saw violence and dispair and death whirl around me yet I was not afraid. It is okay with me if others choose to believe God does not exist, probably wouldn't be able to change their minds no matter what I said. I could have easily died in that hospital, but God had other plans, my daughter and my grandchildren needed me to be here for them, which I am. I am with my family, and to me that is worth more than any dollar value. We are not rich, we are not poor, however that is in terms of dollars and cents, we are rich in many other ways.

We have considered the matter very thoroughly, and we are convinced that our gods could have saved all of the people on the boat.\"',\n",

That is brainwashing and I think a lot of Christians themselves would be against it, but it is not God who inhibits the ability to decide for yourselves, but he definately gives the best path and it is for us to decide whether or not to take it, but in the end karma always comes back around. If you have lived a good life (whether or not you believe in God) you will be rewarded and if you have lived a bad life (whether or not you believe in God) you will be punished.It's not ignorance if you agree with God or to have faith in God's word. Take me for example. I know that we would live in a much better world without alcohol, yet I drink it myself. People argue against drinking it. At best people say it should be drunk responsibly. I personally agree with that, yet in my religion you shouldn't drink any. I've had many bad experiences with alcohol.. I'm pretty sure everybody who has drunk it has. Now, would you be better off without alcohol or with it? I SAY without it, yet ACT with it. It's not just God said so... but He is right? Same with smoking (except I don't really smoke).\",\n",

The truth to this entire debate is that every argument can be answered logically and infinitely, and therefore no logical decision can ever be made. It all has to come down to faith. Either faith in atheism, or faith in theism. That is the key to decision. But how does one acquire that faith? The only way to acquire faith in either direction is either to close your mind and convince yourself, or open your mind, and ask.

       "  'Science tells us accurately about the effects of certain actions. E.g. smoking, drugs, alcohol, homosexuality, unprotected sex.... etc. But people are still free to make decisions. So sometimes, you have the contradictory cases of doctors who know how harmful it is to smoke, but still do it to themselves. In religion, you run into the same contradictions all the time, especially in cases that in my opinion are more delicate in terms of morality because they are more fragile. The difference is, that religious people have no way to argue for why they should do right, other than to \"praise god\", and then they try to impose it. Christianity is not the only religion. Contrary to your view, there are many gods out there and many types of followers. And the main thing they seem to care about is to argue that their god is the right one, in order to justify why they are following such absurd laws without really thinking them through. In this scenario , how is it that belief in god is for the greater good? which god? Because of religion we are always focused on some sort of afterlife and soul saving exercises that take our attention from establishing a better society for all of us. I think it is an unnecessary distraction, all this god talk. Now going back to science. People are still free to do whatever they want to their bodies, because they own them. However they are not free to do whatever they want to their neighbors body. Thus, it would be absurd to say that a doctor who is smoking in his bedroom is breaking a law. It would be absurd to impose that on him. Same with drinking. Only religion imposes some sort of virtual punishment to these people (here or in the afterlife) taking away their personal freedoms. However, when we are talking about society, we have to make laws based on factual evidence, not subjective feelings about things. Yes people make a \"moral\" choice about things, but this choice doesnt necessarily have to be based on fairy tales. It can be based on scientific evidence. However, what if the doctor was smoking in a public place? In Japan they are already passing laws against smoking in public places (train stations for example). Why? Because we know that second-hand smoke is harmful, and so it makes sense to sanction those who want to harm others with their behavior. Murderers also do things that are harmful to others and should go to jail. Drug dealers, the only reason they are doing something wrong is because it entails an economic transaction outside of government regulation. In Amsterdam, marijuana is legalized, based on the scientific study of the effects, and no one is prosecuting the owners of coffee houses for selling it to costumers. A lot of moral laws of religion overlap with common sense (at least in the christian religion) but a lot do not, and they lead to hatred and discrimination based on nothing more than subjective claims that \"god doesn\\'t like it\". Why is homosexuality wrong? Belief in god entails faith, and faith is the ability to believe in something without evidence. Once you believe in god you start to believe whatever else anyone tells you (including the voices in your head - which are not always good) , and then we are steps away from becoming sheep. Science on the other hand teaches us to question. It gives us facts and then we can know what effects it will have for society. Of course science can say how drug abuse affects a country! Im talking about the scientific method of reasoning. Social sciences based on statistics and other forms of study deal with these problems everyday in every university. I think you are underestimating the value of inquiry and critical thinking. Maybe you are just trying to hold on to your subjective believe that you need god to know what is good or bad for you. In my opinion belief in god does nothing for society. NOTHING. Religion puts a focus on things out of this world in order to give people a drive. Is this good? It is, on a very personal level. The problem is that people assume that it was meant for society. Thats where the Jewish had it right in wanting a messiah who would come and liberate them from the political oppression. And they got rightfully pissed off when they realized that this great Jesus did not give a damn about the world here. He cared about souls. Jesus did not accept the temptation of satan when he offered all the kingdoms of the world. remember that story? What does that tell you? that the world belongs to someone other than god. that god\\'s laws do not apply to this world. that this world is better run without religious beliefs. I also grew up in a christian environment and i feel i know the religion pretty well. But I really find religion and faith lacking in ways to help society improve. They help people be happy, find reasons to live, thank god in the midst of trouble... but leave it there. Denying homosexuals of the right to marry because god sees it as wrong, is bullshit. It is called discrimination. Denying women the right to abort because the fetus has a soul, is another bullshit that we cannot prove. Saying you cant smoke a joint because god wouldn\\'t like it, is retarded. Saying that you shouldn\\'t smoke it cause it kills brain cells is a different kind of choice. Use the bible for yourself. or the Koran. Or buddhist texts. Stop eating meat if god tells you. Cover your women. Tithe 10% of your salary to the church. go ahead, but dont say these things make society better. because eventually what religious followers have to be concerned with is to know and prove others that their god is the right one. that the bible is the word of god. not the koran. argh. The example of a pastor is an extreme one, amongst many of the same nature (but not of the same level) of how people interpret their god given missions differently. sure the bible may not say that. but the bible doesnt say a lot of things either and people read into it. also it happens to say a lot of other stuff that makes no sense but people believe it blindly. i mean, have you ever seen a soul? honestly?? why do you blame that pastor? if religion teaches us to connect to some being outside of us and obey? i think all believers in god are deluded in different degrees. the killer pastor, just another one. anyway. im tired of arguing because it clearly seems to me that you already have your faith based point of view, wanting to see that god\\'s laws indeed apply to this world just because sometimes they overlap. the fact that they do is not enough to continue with such fairy tales. we know have evidence about many things, so we can use our reasoning to value whether or not we should take the blue or the red pill.',\n",

All we have to go on is the painting.  The scientist looks at the molecular composition of the paint and the canvas and says there is only what we see.  You have no evidence to claim the artist exists.  Then there are some who say that yes there is a painting therefore there is an artist, he lives and he is beautiful.  Then there are those who look at the composition of the painting and says there is evidence pointing toward an artist, and we can pretty much figure his meaning.  Some people look at the purpose and meaning of life and existence and see the direction of humanity with its struggles and triumphs and the very evolution of the individual as evidence of  \"a God as we understand him\".  It is in this connecting of the dots that some of us find evidence, but no proof.  />   /> There are some who have had profound religious experiences that further enforce that belief.

       "  'I think again, to dispute the assumption that im saying people now are smarter than before is wrong. Im saying people now have more information than before, and more information leads to better choices. Of course egyptian, mayan, and chinese civilizations developed at an amazing rate and with surprising quality for our standards. But the eqyptians were also burying their dead in huge tombs (the pyiramids) and along with exhorbitant amounts of gold, why? because their belief in gods entailed a belief in an afterlife. I think they could have spent their resources and time building other structures that would have helped their community , rather than tombs. (though now we admire them just for cultural value). So it is these kind of behavior that I argue stems from a lack of knowledge about the world and how it works. However it doesn\\'t mean we are \"smarter\" now. Since there are religious believers who continue behaving in the same supersticious ways... When they get sick they pray instead of going to the doctor, etc. But these behavior now should be inexcusable because now we have more knowledge about the world, so it is more like a choice. Back in the time of the Mayans, it may be more acceptable for them to come up with rituals to call for the rain, since they dont have the scientific knowledge about what makes rain fall. But now, when people engage in the same kind of things, it just makes no sense at all because there is more knowledge out there about how things really work. As far as morality goes, I actually think that something like the hamurabi code where the crime was punished in direct retribution, was quite innovative and logical and we could benefit from it. If you steal, we will cut off your hand. End of story. No need for god to induce people to act morally. ;) Just a good execution of the law. Of course this is not the ideal... and again, things are never just \"black and white\", so in the end it may not work in our day. The ideal would be for us to think critically about our actions. To have an awareness about the common good. We dont need an image of \"god\" in this, just as we dont need a hamurabi code. We need something more complex.... a reform in the educational system for example... Belief in non-abrahamic gods for the greater good. hmmm. that makes this more interesting, but still based on my argument above, you can deduce that the image of god is unnecessary. We all have an understanding of god that is different from each other. And there is no way of proving which god is right.

There is something within each human (even those that deny) that has God in them (or a Supreme Being if they so choose to call Him that) whether they like it or not. I have seen grown men that have denied an existence of a God, but, have seen them in a hospital Chapel on bended knees praying to God to save their little girl or save a loved one. One can think there is nothing out there and it's just a belief system until the rage of a horrible incident comes into play and they're kneeling down asking for help.

Macro evolution where a Giraffe one day came from the see is as unlikely as you or I beating Tiger Woods in a golf match. Not going to happen.

Many religions believe, as did Plato about his \"God of the forms,\" that God does not make the laws that rule the universe, but rules by the transcendent laws that are already in place. This being said, a multiplicity of religions believe that God did not create the universe\\'s matter and energy, and nor does he have the power to do so. Also the argument of providing a definition of God to disprove denies one of the fundamental basics of argumentation- in order to disprove anything, you must disprove it within its own framework. For example, to disprove zuess you cannot make up your own definition. It is the same with God. The ontological argument would therefore assert that God must exist universally, because in order for the atheist to disprove God, they have to first accept the definition- which is that he exists',\n",

Did the god create the Universe and set up the laws of physics and then let nature take its course, or does he/she/it have an active involvement in everything with nothing going unnoticed or uninfluenced; or any position between these extremes.In the latter case, why create species and then destroy them (such as extinctions)? What is the reason for creating species that survive by killing and eating other species (that feel pain)? Why do we have diseases that cause so much suffering and what is the point of allowing humans to find cures for diseases that god created? In the former, science can not explain the causes of the Big Bang or the creation of life, but that does not mean there is not a scientific explanation. Many things that were once thought to be to work of god are now explained by science, such as earthquakes, plagues and eclipses. 1,000 years ago god would have been an adequate explanation of these events, but we now have other (scientific) explanations. The things that science has explained so far do not need the intervention or guidance of a god; therefore if there is a scientific explanation of the creation of the world it will probably not need a god either. If there is no god there is no reason (ie nothing is planned or meant to happen). Just because science can not explain something now does not necessarily mean we never will be able to understand it. I feel a little uncomfortable saying that because something is extremely complicated and we donÕt understand it, it must be attributed to a god.

There are atheists with all sorts of philosophies and beliefs.YouÕre already an   atheist  Even if you believe in a god, you probably donÕt believe in other gods - Zeus, Osiris, Jupiter, Thor, Allah or Jesus. ItÕs hypocritical to be skeptical in the holy book, revealed prophets, miracle stories, or holy men of all religions but yours. You are an atheist when it comes to everyone elseÕs gods, so why give your god a free pass?The burden of proof is on the theistCan you prove that an invisible pink elephant is not floating above your head? How does one prove a negative in the absence of evidence? Theists make the exceptional claim that there is a god. That claim requires exceptional proof. The burden of proof is on the theist to prove God exists.By using reason and   science  , humans have been expanding our knowledge of the world. Yet religionists continue to claim that there exists a supernatural realm immune to reason. Where is their proof? If a god is needed to create the universe, what created God? Rather than offer proof, mystics have often tried to silence and discredit those who reveal the complexity and majesty of the universe.There are natural explanations for the universeWhat keeps flowers from turning into rocks, or rocks from floating in the sky? ItÕs not the will of a supernatural deity, but the fact that flowers are not rocks, and gravity keeps things on the ground. The universe operates according to causal principles, without the need for any supernatural   power   to keep things from getting chaotic.Morality does not require religionReligious texts can offer moral guidance, but they are not the source of moral principles. Humans discovered long ago that following certain rules makes life more productive, peaceful, and pleasurable. Morality derives from human nature, not divine guidance. If one wishes to live a virtuous life, it is better to do so because of the earthly rewards of being virtuous rather than the fear of eternal punishment.

The concept conviction is an intellectual conclusion based usually on a lengthy examination of the facts of reality. The concept belief is an abandonment of the intellect and an acceptance of what others have asserted without evidence or proof. Belief is ultimately based on wishes, and requires self-abnegation. Conviction is based on logic and requires self-assertion. Zebrakin states that I consider belief \"pathetic foolishness.\"  Okay, but not accurate. In this day and age, I consider religious belief to be the most lethal form of brute force that men have invented. It stunts one\\'s consciousness and tears it in two, attributing one\\'s best to the non-existent and requiring one regard oneself as sacrificial fodder for the benefit of others. It is a boon to man\\'s rational faculty that he can marvel at the beauty of the universe. But that is not \"in born.\" Such an estimate arises from a fundamental regard of nature as benevolent and of man as heroic. That this is true is shown by the fact that many men do not regard the universe with wonder, nor look upon man as basically good. Instead they regard nature as a threat and man as basically evil. The better philosophers, such as Aristotle and Ayn Rand, have answered the questions you raise. (\"to discover where [men] have come from, where they go to, and why they are here.\") Many scientists, such as archeologists and physicists, have helped by adding factual details.  I sense in your closing statement a melancholy I should like to tell you is not necessary to feel. You wrote: \"Perhaps we feel we have to find answers to these questions because somewhere we know that there\\'s more to this life.\" A proper moral code, found in Ayn Rand\\'s philosophy of Objectivism, shows that one need not wish that life is somehow better beyond the grave where men will find true happiness. One can find true happiness here on earth while we live. But to do so requires courage to face the reality that you have far greater intellectual strength than your religion tells you, far greater wealth of spirit that your beliefs suggest you possess, and that you are far superior in value to those you are taught to sacrifice yourself for. You can find happiness now by rejecting the moral code of your religion and discovering the rational moral code of Objectivism, which briefly put says your life belongs to you and the good is to live it rationally. May I suggest you read Ayn Rand\\'s novels?---Especially Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead.

       "  'Well, I\\'ve been debating theists quite aggressively for a few days now on this site, and frankly I\\'m a little worn out from it. You need to try to understand, that you are looking at the world from a completely different perspective than I am. I know, because I was very religious until my early twenties, it\\'s 2 completely separate mindsets, and it\\'s almost like two different languages one trying to communicate with the other, but I will go through your objections from my point of view the best I can.1. I believe one can account for their perspective on good and evil in humans. We are a pack animal, always have been. Even dog\\'s, with 0 knowledge of any religion, know to protect and \"be kind\" to others in their pack, including their owner whom they see as the pack leader. In the same way, we as humans I believe naturally act in a manner which serves the \"pack\" even often at expense to ourselves. Those who remain within this norm of pack behaviour we call \"good\" those without we call \"evil\".Being brighter and more complex than dogs or any other pack animal, of course this instinct within ourselves becomes complex. But natural and observable none the less with or without any type of creator.2. True, if there was a creator, it would make sense to find our purpose of creation, even if our purpose for being created was strictly for his amusement. But I don\\'t believe in intelligent design either, so not sure how that pertains to my arguement.3. Again, justice is established using our general and natural idea of empathy. And as we see this is not a constant, but shifts with time as we evolve. Empathy is a very natural instinct most humans are born with, which has developed because it does serve for the greater good of humans, even in the circumstance that it should not be in one instance or another the greater good for oneself.This is from us (again) being a pack animal. I think you\\'ll find that if you take away our big brains, we really are a pathetic and week creature compared to most mamals.Minus our big brain, without the abilty to work together as a whole, and this means establishing rules and a sense of justice, we would be quite extinct right now, having all been eaten by lions and tiger and bears oh my.4. I would argue no one \"grounds it\", even the religious. What difference does it make what one\\'s morals are grounded in if they have them none the less? The only relevent point is that a god is unnecessary for one to have a reason to live or a moral compass to live by. I never said the religious don\\'t feel their morals are grounded, I simply offer myself as proof that the idea many of the religious have, that life without a god is somehow empty, is quite incorrect.5. mass murder read it, tons of examples. Just as many examples of the religious killing as of the non-religious killing. There is no proof to back up the idea that a person who doesn\\'t believe in a god is more or less likely to kill, than one who believes in a god, and somehow twists it so that their god encourages the act of killing. Your arguement holds no water.6. I don\\'t see what you\\'re refering to, if you are numbering this according to my highlighted points, there is no evidence either way, and that\\'s my point. There\\'s a lack of evidence here.7. But this is the point. Your original arguement puts forth that, the religious are more moral because they have specifically religion to guide them. My point is again, while religion guides the vast majority of the human population (82% apx) those not guided by a religion are just as likely to be \"good\" or \"evil\" which would appear to make the belief in a god unnecessary in order to be \"moral\"8. lol, this was hard to read. I\\'m not impressed by pretty words when discussing theology. I\\'m not swayed by mindless examples. My belief is one caught in a rip-tide is just as likely to drown whether they believe in god or not. You seem to be under the impression that there is something in life to be saved from. I do not see it this way. This is what I\\'m talking about when I say that it\\'s like two people trying to communicate in two different languages. You do not seem to understand that I do not believe there is anything to be saved from in the general sense, and in the literal sense, I\\'ve never seen or heard of god saving anyone whose life was in mortal danger. Some live, some die, belief in god does not change these odds at all. The religious listen to example after example of people saying \"I was saved\" it\\'s indoctrinated into the fiber of your being. From the outside, it looks like silly people looking for an easy way out. No one is saved, because there is nothing to be saved from. We live, we die, we make what we make out of it in the time in between. God plays no role. Some choose to believe in a god, but those who do not are just as happy, and quite often more so, than those who do. And in the end, whether someone believes in a god or not, they die and it\\'s lights out. I don\\'t think a religious person will \"live forever\" any more than I believe I will \"live forever\". What one believes is irrelevant ultimately outside of what they do with it here on earth while alive.Now, the religious can hardly (if at all) wrap their heads around the concept of simply being dead. It\\'s like they have to believe there is an after-life, and by default, have to believe that everyone else must on some level at least want to believe there is an afterlife.I assure you, I do not on any level believe in an afterlife. I do not want to on any level trick myself into believing in an afterlife. I believe it is self-destructive to fool oneself in such a way.9. You have some typos that make this hard to understand. I think what your saying is that my account of how religion started is off,in which case the point flew clear over you, which it always does when I get into these discussions.Again, it\\'s nearly impossible to explain to one such as yourself.But I\\'m not trying to explain exactly how religion began.I was simply giving an alternative example in order to point out my opinion thatreligion is quite unnecessary. That is what th point was.There is no point in me trying to guess how it all started (though I imagine it was from an inherent need within born of self-realization to not cease to exist at some point, which is not even the theory I put forth, but there you go)As I was saying, there is no point for me trying to guess though how it all started, and I don\\'t care how or why it all started.My only point is that it is unnecessary.',\n",

How else could such a devine creature exist if not created by an even greater one?

If God created the universe, then where does he keep it?     If God is good, all powerfull, and all knowing, yet evil exists.  That proves that he either doesn not exist, or that he is not good, all knowing and all powerful, and therefore NOT devine.    We are made in his image, yet we are imperfect.  Therefore, God is imperfect and therefore NOT devine.     All of the   religious   texts were created by man, so using thems as proof is a fallacy.  It's not as if the good book magically appeared.  The STORY of the   ten commandments   is the only aspect that supposedly was drafted by God himself.  He exists because I read it in a book that some man wrote a long time ago.  Well there were a lot of books written a long time ago about the supposed ONE creator, and none of them are in agreement.  The fact that the three major religions all worship the same God comes from the fact that all three religions came from the same screwed up part of the world that still cannot abide by the   teaching   of peace found in all three religions.

By definition, one could not \"murder\" a non-Israelite. So the commandment is more accurately translated as \"don\\'t kill your own.\" Had it been a blanket prohibition on killing, the Israelites would have been in violation of it quite routinely, as they attacked plenty of neighboring non-Jews.3) If \"true Christians\" never asked for anybody to be put to death, then by your own admission the entirety of your religion has been a big steaming pile o\\' horsehockey throughout its whole history, because Christians have been doing that since Christianity first appeared, and they still are.4) Not associating Catholics with Christians is looney-tunes.

       "  'Your reasoning is nonsense and has no sound justification.What William Carroll reminds us , ÒSt. Thomas Aquinas developed an analysis of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo that remains one of the enduring accomplishments of Western culture. The key to Aquinas\\' analysis is the distinction he draws between creation and change. The natural sciences, whether Aristotelian or those of our own day, have as their subject the world of changing things: from sub-atomic particles to acorns to galaxies. Whenever there is a change there must be something that changes. The Greeks are right: from nothing, nothing comes; that is, if the verb \"to come\" means a change. All change requires an underlying material reality.Creation, on the other hand, is the radical causing of the whole existence of whatever exists. To cause completely something to exist is not to produce a change in something, is not to work on or with some already existing material. If, in producing something new, an agent were to use something already existing, the agent would not by itself be the complete cause of the new thing. But such a complete causing is precisely what creation is. To create is to give existence, and all things are totally dependent upon God for the very fact that they are. God does not take nothing and make something out of \"it.\" Rather, anything left entirely to itself, separated from the cause of its existence, would be absolutely nothing. Creation is not some distant event; it is the continuing, complete causing of the existence of everything that is. Creation, thus, is a subject for metaphysics and theology, not for the natural sciences.What is essential to Christian faith, according to Aquinas, is the \"fact of creation,\" not the manner or mode of the formation of the world. Aquinas\\' firm adherence to the truth of Scripture without falling into the trap of literalistic readings of the text offers valuable correction for exegesis of the Bible which concludes that one must choose between the literal interpretation of the Bible and modern science. For Aquinas, the literal meaning of the Bible is what God, its author, intends the words to mean. The literal sense of the text includes metaphors, similes, and other figures of speech useful to accommodate the truth of the Bible to the understanding of its readers. For example, when one reads in the Bible that God stretches out His hand, one ought not think that God has a hand. The literal meaning of such passages concerns God\\'s power, not His anatomy. Nor ought one think that the six days at the beginning of Genesis literally refer to God\\'s acting in time, for God\\'s creative act is instantaneous.ÓRecent speculations that the universe began as \"quantum tunneling from nothing\" reaffirm the ancient Greek principle that you cannot get something from nothing. For the \"vacuum\" of modern particle physics, whose \"fluctuation\" some see as bringing our universe into existence, is not absolutely nothing. It is not anything like our present universe, but it still is something. Or else, how could it fluctuate?  Even if the universe were the result of the fluctuation of a primal vacuum, it would not be a self-creating universe.

Moreover, it is not clear that the conventional wisdom cited here is in fact universal to the human species (and even if it were, so what? Humankind can\\'t be wrong?). I would suspect that this is a cultural, not a species, assumption. An idea, for example, which had been dominant in the West was that of the great chain of being, where all things were connected in this chain, and related things looked like one another. Thus, in the Renaissance walnuts were thought to be good for treating problems with the brain because they resembled human brains. An even bigger objection is that the claim that things tend to \"reflect\" their source seems to be inaccurate. It is also a vague phrase that can probably be shifted in ways that make it impossible to disprove, but let\\'s leave that aside. The examples given here really stack the deck. For any one exmaple of how a thing looks like its source, I could likely give 10 examples of things that do not. Knowledge looks nothing like the books from which it was obtained; books look nothing like trees; trees look nothing like acorns; acorns, in turn, look nothing like trees, nor like sunlight, water, or nutrients. I shouldn\\'t have to belabor the obvious here - claiming that things resemble their sources is such a vague claim that it is largely meaningless, and if the claim is made more specific, it becomes less apparent that this is something we should assume, \"conventional wisdom\" or not. Without this very problematic assumption, there is no argument. The American atheists must really be slacking off if they haven\\'t registered an objection to this \"argument\" yet.',\n",

There are a significant number of people, both in straight and gay relationships, who honestly recognize that they DID have a choice -- they COULD have fallen in love with someone of either gender.  These people are bisexual, even if they do not personally identify as such.

       "  '----------------------------Leviticus----------------------------Leviticus is commonly misinterpreted to refer to homosexuals with the following 2 verses:Leviticus 18:22: \"You shall not lie with a male as those who lie with a female; it is an abomination.\" Leviticus 20:13: \"If a man lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination and they shall surely be put to death.\" These verses have nothing to do with   homosexuality   when you look at the rest of Leviticus and other passages. Both of these verses refer to heterosexuals who participated in fertility rituals in order to guarantee good crops and healthy flocks, not homosexuals, there is absolutely no mention of sexual orientation or homosexuality. Also, the word abomination was used for anything that was considered to be religiously unclean or dealing with any type idol worship.The Hebrew word \"toevah\" was used in Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13. \"Toevah\" has been translated in our Bibles as \"abomination\" or \"detestable\". The \"toevah\" was used throughout the Old Testament for activity involving ethnic contamination and   religious   idolatry. \"Toevah\" refers to things that were ritually unclean - like eating pork. It is significant that another Hebrew word, \"zimah,\" also translated \"abomination,\" which means intrinsic evil or evil by its very nature, was not used in Leviticus 18:22, or Leviticus 20:13.Notice that Lev. 18:2 deals with idolatry. In fact many of the prohibitions in the Holiness Code were connected with idolatrous practices, see 19:26-29.--------------------------------Romans--------------------------------This is another passage commonly taken out of context. Romans was not talking about homosexuality, it was referring to idolatrous practices and other sins. Letters from the Apostle Paul Romans 1:26-27If taken out of context, this passage seems to condemn homosexuals. However, when Romans 1:26-27 is considered within the context of Romans 1:16 through Romans 2:16, the Scriptures clearly present a different   teaching  . Paul was writing to the   church   in Rome. The Roman church had become troubled by divisions related to   spiritual   pride. Paul was addressing the Christians in Rome and teaching about the pagans in Rome. After declaring the   power   of Christ\\'s gospel to save all, he pointed out that the religious people of Rome had refused to even acknowledge GOD as one of their many gods. They had turned their backs on the one true living God and worshiped handmade idols. Paul explained that as a result of their idolatry, every part of their lives had become corrupt and vile. Paul then told the Roman Christians that they were not to judge others. To judge others is to condemn yourself (Romans 2:1). Christians are to love others out of their brokenness and into the   healing   wholeness that is found in Jesus Christ. The Greek word Paul used, that has been translated in our Bibles as \"natural/unnatural\", relates to that which is against one\\'s own inherent nature (i.e., heterosexuals engaging in   homosexual   acts). It was also related to Paul\\'s concept of what was culturally acceptable. The same Greek word is used in I Cor. 11:14-15 in reference to correct hair length for men and women and in Gal. 2:15 in reference to Jews and Gentiles who were such by \"nature.\" Paul emphasized that IDOLATRY (not homosexuality) was the evil which resulted in temple prostitution, sadomasochism, and lack of regard for others.

       "  '\"Rational moral truth is based on the observation that people are all basically the same, that they have the same fundamental physical, psychological, and spiritual needs (by \"spiritual\" I do NOT mean, religious or supernatural. I merely mean needs that are not physical).\"This understanding of human sameness or shared anthropology is incomplete precisely because you leave out the actual spiritual element of man yet give the illusion that it is included.  The idea that all people are basically the same, i.e.. created equal (again something only guaranteed  by God), is a Biblical idea.  One could suppose that in a modern rationalistic society why would we put so much stock in a principle from a \"dusty old book?\"  Perhaps because this dusty old book is right.  You include the physical, biological or bodily part of man (Gk. Soma) and the psychological part (Gk.psyche), but by defining spiritual by something that it is not you actually fail to give an adequate definition which is to state which that thing is.  Equating spiritual needs to \"merely...needs that are not physical\" fails to distinguish between what is actually a spiritual need and what could also be a emotional need or a psychological need which can also not be considered physical in the biological sense.  The implication of this vaguely communicated idea of spiritual need actually leaves out the real essence of spiritual need.  This is necessary to fit the paradigm of \"live and let live\" because such a structure of apparent moral law fails to account for the totality of the human experience not just in the individual human experience but in the communal as well.  It is incapable of doing so because the motive is not the ultimate concern for the common good but an excuse of the individual to unconcern them self with the good of the other.  As the concept \"live and let live\" is shaped by the humanistic framework of individuals operating as laws unto themselves, it fails.  When, as was originally meant in the phrase \"live and let live,\" it is to literally do unto others as you would have them do unto you there is a change for hope.  Here the common good and the good of the neighbor is established.  It is not about how little should be done (tolerate, mind your own business about the life of others) but what should be done (how can I love my neighbor in this circumstance, what does it mean to love my neighbor?).  This is the a central teaching of Jesus Christ and of Christianity.  The modern   evolution   of the idiom however, has scarce remembrances of this original meaning and fails precisely because, again, it does not take into account the breadth of human experience both individually and communally (and is unequipped to address the full experience because its own ethos makes such parts and judgments of others off limits) and has no concern for the common good (because likewise the good cannot be established because the ethos of the modern \"live and let live\" make such judgments impossible).  I should clarify by judgments I don\\'t intend to imply being judgmental  but rather only the ability to judge whether the actions, motives and intentions of the other are morally right or wrong according to the Good.  Compare:\"Live and let live, i.e. Do as you would be done by...\"-1678, English Proverbs\"Live and let live is a pretty good philosophy. If the guy in the next lane isn\\'t buckled up, why not leave him alone?\" (2001, Washington Times)Both quotes acquired from the The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs.[See also my other post, \"Christ...fully reveals man to himself.\"]Secondly, you further beg the question, i.e. provide a circular argument, by stating that live and let live is good because watching people live and let live (without the ability to harm others) is good because you have observed it so.  You then conclude, therefore, that homosexuality is not morally wrong.  This is Non Sequitur; where the logic of your agrument does not follow from the premise to the conclusion offered.

Why put words in my mouth. The \"experts\" experience certainly is legitimate and I have said so in numerous other posts. I do believe that he is Gay but has chosen not to act on it. There\\'s nothing he can do about being Gay just like I could not make myself become attracted to men. He can, and has chosen to live a non gay lifestyle.ÓAs the old clich\\x8e goes: ÒWhat we have here is a failure to communicateÓ.Sorry but my original comment wasn\\'t intended to put things in your mouth. I just wasnÕt discriminating between what you were saying and my own paraphrasing. IÕll break it down and explain how I am interpreting and hopefully you will be able to then explain where you are coming from. In any case if we keep at it IÕm sure we can get there.IÕll break up what I said into two bits. There is the bit about you assuming the expertÕs experience is illegitimate. You make the claim that Alan Chambers is simply choosing not to act on his gay impulses and that there is nothing that he can do about being gay just like you could not make yourself attracted to men.Alan Chambers said: ÒI know that thousands of men and women defy Ð and continue to defy Ð any possible genetic or biological links to homosexuality and changed their sexual orientation through the help of caring individuals, counseling and faith-based support groups.ÓCertainly I am looking at it through the lens of my own experience but when he speaks of changing sexual orientation and speaks of his own experiences I take it to mean more than simply choosing not to act on gay impulses although that may have been the first step. By a change of sexual orientation I take it to mean that he has largely or completely lost his gay impulses in that he is either generally or completely no longer attracted to men. If I am correct then you consider his assertion and experience to be illegitimate when you assert that all that is involved is not acting on gay impulses and there is nothing that can be done about being gay and attracted to men. Does that make sense?I might as well add that the reason I chose you to respond to is that for someone in your situation to make the apparent pronouncement I feel disrespected to the extent that my experience overlaps with Alan\\'s. I wouldn\\'t feel that if a gay guy expressed that view.The second bit is the related. I am claiming that you are stating that his change of orientation is just like a decision to be monogamous. That is it is simply a case of not following urges. You used monogamy as an analogy and I inferred that in doing so you meant to communicate that nothing more is involved and that it is just an act of will power not a genuine change of orientation. Hopefully again this is sufficient explanation. Please feel free to let me know how I am misinterpreting.ÓBTW your experiences are yours alone and do not refute the overwhelming evidence that the vast majority of Gay men cannot change their sexual orientation.ÓI believe they give a better insight into the situation than your own experiences. Even if a majority either due to biological, environmental, or ingrained beliefs canÕt change but a minority can why couldnÕt Alan be in that minority?Barbaroni,Thanks for the response. That is not the way it appears to me. I\\'ve said what I\\'ve said but I can empathise with how you feel.

       "  'I\\'ve been reading the opposite side with a lot of interest and just like I expected, people have brought in a whole array of \"issues\" they have about homosexuality.First I read about how the motives of the gay person are selfishMy response: WHO CARES? I see an old lady crossing the street. I help her cross over. Did I do it because I truly cared for her or did I do cause I wanted to feel good about myself? Does it matter? As long as I didn\\'t help her because I wanted to steal her purse in the process then where is the harm???? So what if gays want to satisfy their parental instincts by caring for a child? How does that undermine the care and the love? Don\\'t straight couples do the same? How many times have I heard straight couples saying that they will have children because that \"completes the family\", that they can\\'t wait to be great mums or great dads. That\\'s selfish too isn\\'t it? But is it wrong? Hell no! I would be worried of someone didn\\'t have that streak of selfishness in them. In my opinion, the people that make the best parents are the ones that wanted to be parents in the first place. Not just procreate, but BE PARENTS afterward. Here we have people that are begging to be parents and we\\'re telling them \"you can\\'t! we\\'d rather leave the kids in the orphanage than give them to you!\"Then it\\'s about how it is unnatural for them to become parents because by definition they would be required to do something that is unnatural for them Right, so, should we exclude all infertile individuals from the right to adopt?Because the above argument basically implies that inability to conceive/procreate equals inability to perform as a parent, because nature didn\\'t want you to become one in the first place. Isn\\'t that ridiculous? The fact that we have children in foster care proves that the ability to conceive/procreate does not equal the ability to become a parent. So the two are clearly not cross linked.Then it\\'s about how it is no one\\'s right to adopt because the only person that has authority over a child is the biological parent - only they can \"appoint\" someone to look after their childSomeone actually used the word \"property\", the child is the property of the biological parents and no institution should ever have the right bypass them and give the child to someone else. Since when are human beings \"property\"?As a parent, all you have, is the responsibility to raise the child and provide for it. That\\'s all you have. You don\\'t posses a child. No one has possession of another human being, however young. Now, I know for a fact that adoption agencies always look for people in the immediate or larger family that would foster the child. It\\'s only when they have exhausted all those possibilities that the child is put up for adoption. In other words, no one in the family has offered to take over the responsibility! So it is then in the hands of the agency to find suitable parents from the general public. Let\\'s be realistic, the family has absolved itself, or is not existent, or is mentally incapable. Now, I\\'m not saying everybody else then has the right to be their parent. But I think they do have the right to at least apply for the role, whether gay or straight. But the child is going to be bullied!Well, is that really an argument? If the kid is going to be bullied that\\'s because the parents of the other children are bigoted and they have instilled that bigotry on their bully-kid. Kids are bullied everyday for being black, Muslim, Asian, tall, short, ginger etc etc. Does that mean we should take them away from their black, Muslim or ginger parents? The reality is, these kids are spending their life in an orphanage. I find it funny how people who are otherwise unwilling to adopt them, think that they have the right to obstruct others who do. And they justify it with an array of bigoted crap. And all this time, those kids remain in the orphanage, when they could be in the hands of very loving, very caring, very responsible people who could give them a much better life, a much better education and much more to experience.',\n",
