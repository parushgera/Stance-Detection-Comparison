0	god	I disagree with you completely.  Evolution is fact.  The fossils prove that.  Darwin proposed the theory of evolution by means of natural selection.  Intelligent design is just another theory, a theory of evolution by means of intelligent design (the proponents accept change has occurred and that natural selection occurs at species level),  They have failed to provide any evidence whatsoever for ID.  What would be proof?  Well, it would have to be a big jump in evolution, perhaps something like a fossil rabbit in Jurassic rocks along with dinosaur fossils, something showing that large and unexpected changes have occurred.  One theory doesn't become true just because your incredulity makes it difficult to accept other theories.  The theories you want to favour have to have some (any???) facts supporting them.	AGAINST

2	god	"Since there is no scientific evidence to prove a ""god's"" existence, and most stories and ideas about ""god"" have been proven wrong over the course of history, it is safe to say that there more than likely is no ""god,"" and if there is, he, she or it likely doesn't care about humanity. Therefore it is detrimental for societies to believe in ""god"" for 2 main reasons: 1: It gives people who ""speak for god"" absolute power and infallibility in the eyes of their followers, and 2: It causes people to react based on emotions as opposed to reason.1. Those who believe that their leaders are under ""god's"" guidance and are therefore all powerful and infallible put themselves under the yoke of authoritarianism. Though authoritarianism can be achieved without belief in ""god,"" religion is certainly a tool in the authoritarian arsenal as either a means of oppression, i.e: the Spanish Inquisition; or as a means of persecution, i.e: Soviet Russia/Nazi Germany. Erasing ""god"" from the minds of people allows them more freedom in their thoughts and actions. It should be up to the individual to decide what his or her personal moral boundaries and beliefs are. People should not be influenced by religion or ""god"" because they end up supporting what they are told to support as opposed to what they would support on their own.2. Belief in ""god"" causes people to respond to difficult situations with emotion rather than logic, i.e: the Crusades/ fundamentalist Islamic terrorist organizations. Though not all conflicts stem from beliefs in ""god,"" many do, and the world would be better off with fewer reasons for people to fight. Karl Marx said that religion is the opium of the people. It causes the individual to feel a certain way without taking into account his or her personal opinions. It gives people ideas for irrational plans in dealing with their problems as opposed to logical problem solving strategies. Islamic terrorism is a great example. Much of the animosity Muslim extremists feel towards the West is due to the West's support of Israel. They fight back with car bombs and suicide bombers, when peace talks would be much more effective in supporting their case."	AGAINST
3	god	" I am actually laughing at the feeble nature of your arguments. Irrefutable evidence? Ha! For the love of God (and yes, I used the Lords name in vain on purpose), why must everything complex and wonderful have to be made by a superior mind? Why do you have such a problem with accepting the possibility that everything just happened and we are the beneficiers of this Great Accident?  /> And as for contact with God? There are cases all over the world of such claims, all of them disproven.  You want to believe that you have been touched by him, so the brain simulates your desire.  A simple psychosomatic reaction. Cases have been so extreme as to induce ""stigmata"", Christ-like wounds upon believers.  I have no problem with people accepting the possibility that either religion or science is the answer, but people like this, the ones who deny any other reasoning, who make pathetic arguments for their side, despite tangible evidence of any kind, that really grate on me. God is simply another form of control that drones follow without question, because they are too foolish to question authority. Simple."	AGAINST
4	god	"Of course not.  There's no evidence for any kind of entity that somehow stands outside of existence and ""creates"" it.One should recognize that matter cannot be created or destroyed.  It is. It always was and always will be.  Matter changes its form but it does not cease to exist.  The notion of God goes back to pre-historic times when men sought an explanation for the universe and its contents. It was an understandable thing to do.  But now thanks to many geniuses---philosophers such as Aristotle and Ayn Rand and scientists such as Galileo and Newton---we've come to understand much about the universe and about the nature of man and how he learns and the legitimate forms of knowledge.  There is still much to learn.  To learn it, we certainly should put aside ancient myths.  Mysticism always leads to brutality. Faith and force go together.  Those not dedicated to reason seek to force others to believe as they do. Religion is an immoral institution and it starts with the notion that some omnipotent, infallible god in on somebody's side and others must be forced to believe it.  Consider the Crusades, the Inquisition, the witch hunts and today's latest ""fad"" suicide bombers.  All these kill themselves and others in the name of their god. No, Virginia, there is no God. Human beings are responsible for their actions.  Nature is a wonderful benevolent place.  But as Lord Bacon said, ""To command nature, we must obey it.""  So one should put all one's intellectual effort into understanding it and leave off with the wishful thinking and fantasies of religions. "	AGAINST
5	god	 There is no personal creator God who cares if you are 'sinning' and wants to send you to hell.  That's fantasy.  I can't say with absolute certainty that there is not a superior power that may have created the universe.  It's one really easy explanation to explain where all this came from, and life itself.  It's not based on anything more than a hunch though, and it comforts people.  Plus... Where the heck is God if he does exist?  So... I'm about 99% sure there is no God.  Science and reason show us how things work in the world, and nothing that has happened required a creator or God to make it happen.  Rather than ask how can the universe seem to come from nothing (common misconception), ask yourself how a supreme all-knowing force can just exist, where does that come from? Oh of course... God doesn't need an origin, does he?  It's a simple way to fill in gaps in our knowledge without using our brains so much, to say that God just made it all.

Laws are changing all the time right? Now if they were good, then they wouldn't need to be changed. And if they have been changed then whose to say that they do not need to be changed again? God's Words will always be right till the end of time. We just don't see it, but in the end we will see it.

I see people on here saying roughly the equivalent of ""How do you know? Have you done a complete search of the universe and not found a god?"". There's also the common ""You can't prove a god DOESN'T exist!"" argument. These two arguments can be used against any sort of mythical/hypothetical thing. If I questioned everything in my life this way, I would be leaving room in my mind for every Bigfoot-esque concept in existence.   />   /> Frankly, I am comfortable with just not knowing certain things about the beginnings of our universe and humankind. To me the existence of a supernatural power(s) is just another theory humans have come up with regarding the genesis of the world, the universe, and man. A few others include the Big Bang and evolution. At the moment, I am inclined to believe more in these than the existence of a god simply because of certain proofs. Notice that I say ""believe more"" than ""believe completely"". I have complete faith in neither, as parts of both theories have been proven wrong by the very scientists who formulated their creation. They have been changed and tested (and continue to be) by the international scientific community. Theories don't claim to have all of the answers, but they do stand up to logic (and when aspects of them don't they are thrown out the window). The concept of a higher power does the opposite.  />   /> Basically, I'd rather admit to not knowing about my origins (as a human and as a resident in our solar system) than believe in something that isn't logical, which is why god doesn't exist in my life.  />   /> P.S.

As an example; if the commandments were handed down in the way the old testament proclaims they were, amidst all kinds of shenanigans, I firmly believe the addition of a god would not have been a necessity, that even they as wild as the book claims them to be, would have wrapped their heads around acting in such a way was self-destructive, without the introduction of some god. (For the record, most likely none of that happened, and it is simply a variation on similar stories found from the older version, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, but it serves as an example)It would seem on the surface to many atheists then, that religion at worse is simply a no-lose, no-gain thing people do.I disagree. I think while many aspects of religion, indeed most, encourage good behaviour,I believe taking the easy-out of describing to the religious masses that the reason this optimal behaviour is desirable as ""uh, uh, because god said so"" encourages stupidity and a lack of reflection,which while in many cases leads to a group of people who act properly in society,at the same time makes it really easy to get them to do ridiculous things like blow up buildings in the name of allah, or crusade against the middle east in the name of god.Thinking people do not act in such a way.

God sent His only Son to enter into our humanity, so that we could enter into His Spirit- and live.  He is transforming us from being mere creatures, into children with life breathed into them, and preparing us for true union.  God made the rocks, trees and all that exists here- but people are different.  Yes, people create lots of God, and somehow struggle against the only true God who asks that we be willing to give up all others.  He is looking for hearts that seek Him, because He knows the better end in store.  Free will allows us to choose the pastures that satisfy us with earthly things.

If you enter a relationship where your mate would care, it's probably a bad idea to go fooling around.I honestly do understand everything you are saying, you're being thick headed.	AGAINST

We couldn't prove what the sun was. We couldn't prove what stars were. We couldn't prove anything regarding atoms, molecular theory, or most of the modern principles of biology and physics.And people, religious people, simply claimed they were God acting in his way. Further back, when it was offered that the world was round and the sun was the center of our galaxy, not the earth, the church killed people over those views. Further back, the Egyptians attributed the sun, the moon and their harvest to religion. Happy gods brought good harvests. Angry gods brought plagues. No science, and religion filled the holes.Religion has always said ""Science can't prove it, therefore it must be god"". And, given enough time, science has always found evidence. "	AGAINST

61	god	"Regarding the cults, the reason why I find them relevant is because followers of the abrahamic religions dismiss them as being completely ""crazy"" when in my opinion, the abrahamic religions in themselves are as deranged as cults. So I find them relevant because it shows what happens when people try to say that they have access to ""god"" or can possibly know his/her mind. There are people out there who still believe in talking snakes... I admit your point in saying we can never know ""everything"", but you must admit that when you make a desicion, even as simple as buying a new computer, you do research and try to find out as much as you can so that you will be better equipped for making a decision. It's as simple as that... we become more educated so we can make better decisions. Which leads to the final point... religious people do not do things just to please god, but because they also think it's the right way of living. I think we are all entitled to the same freedom religious people want of choosing the best way of living if this behavior is not going to harm anyone else. I've never come across any scientific evidence as to why sodomy is bad for you. Therefore, I have no basis for saying it is ""bad"". Why is it bad? If you point out something in science, then you will agree that we need education, scientific facts, to help us make desicions that are not bad for us. But if you just ""think"" it is bad for no reason at all... then it makes no sense. I dont understand your argument about being part lion part tiger. A girl of 12 consenting to sex with a 90 year old... i think if we continue with this god bullshit, children CAN be brainwashed into doing things without questioning them. Have you watched the videos about Jesus Camp? It is very close to the same brainwashing that cult leaders do... and you know what makes it so wrong? that it is targetted at children, who are suceptible . Just as a girl of 12 , we both would agree, has not reached the age of consent to have sex; the children from jesus camp also have not reached the age of consent to accept or reject ideas independently. why? because they have not been exposed to more information about the world. how can god be for the greater good when it inhibits our ability to decide for ourselves? About drugs. I believe they are bad because Ive read enough about their effects on the body. Thus I can say they are bad, there is evidence. But saying things are bad just because of some intuition about god, is just plain ignorance."	AGAINST

63	god	In the first place there has to be a first cause. We have to start somewhere. In   science   this is called the Unified Force. Since   energy   can neither be created nor destroyed it is infinite. Science also teaches that it is beyond direct observation so it is unknowable. So the Unified Force splits into the Strong Force, the Weak Force and Electromagnetism, creating the Universe.There are then two questions. First, what is the difference between the Unified Force and God? In both cases we have an infinite, unknowable force creating the Universe. Second, what caused the Unified Force to break itself apart?	FAVOR
64	god	 God does exist because I exist, and I felt his love and received the Holy Spirit.

65	god	I consider myself an atheist, for I see no need for a god to have created the universe or have any role in the playing out of events in this existence.  However this does not automatically mean that god does not exist.  Yet if a god does exist, I do not believe it would be at all the sort of god which any of today's religions adhere to.  It would not care about humans anymore than the air around us, for we are all simply made of matter, energy, and void which interacts according to strict rules which we have never seen broken.  Why would the creator of EVERYTHING care about one small bit of its creation which is in no way different than any other bit except in its own heavily biased opinion.  The universe may just be some pan-dimensional teenager's science-fair experiment simulation on his computer which they created to study the formation of galaxies.  Humans and other life are just things which happened to develop due to this set up of the laws of physics.	AGAINST
66	god	I'm sorry you have so much disbelief. Obviously you put a lot of energy to justify in your own-self about any faith towards God. I'm just going dispute some of the comments about if the world would be better of if Christians where gone. All I have to say is think of a places in the world where there is no God and you will only see death, poverty and despair. The evolution is a farce. Do you remember the cover of national geographic when they had a ape like skull saying that they have found the missing link. Of course that was found out to be a fraud. Point I'm making is, all you have to do is look around and look at the perfect order of nature the extreme complexity and to not even think that there is a creator designer behind it that it is just a mere coincidence. It's just stupid to think that all you are is just a piece of walking flesh do to the fact that evolution is the only reason you are here. And that all of nature with it's perfect order is because. Just look up the number of charities and the number is overwhelmingly Christian based probably the number would be actually more because a lot of them are but are afraid of persecution from Church and State laws.You have denial issues I think deep down you really feel that all of these things are possible but you have chosen to block it out and harden yourself for the truth.You know what makes me laugh is that you have Agnostic historians looking in the bible for references to help them find ancient cities and places. Take Troy for example just to name one out the dozens. They thought it was a myth until they discovered it referenced passages out of the bible to help them. Dude totally have taken the whole 9/11 thing to far. Pretty insulting of course I don't believe those you said. All I was saying is that we have been relatively safe as a nation and my faith believes that yes God does protect us nothing wrong with that. Bad things do happen no matter what trials and tribulations are a part of life.As far as using you storied and other quotes from people and Tibet tribes whatever. I don't care what they think. I don't look to others to convince me of what I know and believe I question man when I hear a preacher or someone else taking about their Ideas. All I know is that there is a God and creator of us and everything. It's my own personal believe. Shame on those missionaries for using a lame story about that which is not true. If they where Mormon that would sound like a BS story from them.	FAVOR

Basic Fact: ""Every cell in plants,   animals  , and human beings has what is called a ""complex metabolic motor"". This is the ability of the cell to extract energy from its   environment   in order to supply energy for the reproduction of the cell and other cell needs. For life to exist, you must have this metabolic motor. But this metabolic motor can only be produced by life."" (Dr. Ron Carlson) It's the same for DNA.

I feel more peaceful on those days than I ever do in any other situation. God is a universal entity in that no matter what culture you are talking about, there is a notion of a supreme being. It's human nature to believe so. It's just that as time progressed, we realized that there really isn't a god for everything, like in polytheistic religions. Instead, we have God who watches over us. He allows the world to run on its own and makes sure good things come out of evil acts. And what else would compel people to do good. I want to do good, primarily, so that I can feel a sense of pride in myself. After this, I also feel I owe it to God to help others the way he has helped me. Even in ancient religions, people acted morally in order to avoid the wrath of their gods. They also sacrificed animals, etc, but that was culture specific.	FAVOR

All the main religions grow for one reason; Child indoctrination. Christianity did it throughout the 1700's, stealing children from their families ""baptising them"" and bringing them up as fanatics. All religions grab the attention of young children with false promises and teach them to ignore and hate all other points of view. Religion is just indoctrination, hitler did it exactly the same way religion did it and it must be stopped. There is no need for a god. Evolution says there isn't and thanks to the missing link being proved yesterday ir is proven and there is no argument against it apart from the usual religious argument of shouting No repeatedly until you go away.

Now many people experience him in a different way but we have to, I think, chalk it up a lot to culture and ideas about what he is. Some people are actually incapable of experiencing god because they lack the prerequisites usually sucked out of them by a lifetime of incredulity. Or in some cases never there in the first place. I'd like to give an example. My mathematics professor was once asked by a colleague how he could believe in god and still be such a logical person. His reply was more or less along these lines, ""I'd explain it to you but you couldn't understand in the time we have."" ""Why not?"" ""Could we pull someone off the street and explain to them complex number theory until they understood it as well as we do? Of course not, they need a basis to start from.""

He can't do that with God.Why is it that I trust a science book and not the Bible? Because science is based on evidence. Not just what you can see, but anything that can somehow be shown to exist.

A the scene of an accident, you can rush forward rip off your buttoned up shirt and proclaim.. 'if he/she dies, that's the end of the road..'back to the point, (i really think an accompanied video with you blowing bubbles could have added some ground to your argument.) I think the most direct and clear paradox of life is.. the lack of entropy. The perpetual state of dynamics, of life. in the very universe itself. I don't think you've ever considered that. I think it's the most blatantly profound truth in   existence  . With our limited understanding of physical   science  , this is an impossibility.

Bad things happen because god made a world of order. It may look like chaos but it is an order. And for order to work some things have to happen every once in a while.

This rock makes a molten core which causes convection currents which makes; earth quakes, tsunamis and volcanoes. Does the occurrence of these things prove or disprove god? It does neither. Some people live in   poverty  , some suffer and live in pain and death. Does this mean that there is no god, or that if there is that he doesn't care? The   bible   says that he gave man free agency. If he were to pop down here and say hello to all of us, and help us out of our miseries what would happen to our agency? If he jumped in and made a   murder   stop, wouldn't he have just over ridden that murder's agency?If you wanted to know how people to make certain decisions, would you let them know that your there and watching, or would you keep your presence unknown?Where in the bible does it say that god condemns people to hell?

88	god	The only God you disprove with your arguments is the one that you have created within your own mind. In order to disprove any framework of belief, you must adopt that framework and disprove it within itself; therefore, you cannot define God. Because you have failed to disprove God in every sense of the term, your arguments cannot be valid. For example: you have failed to disprove one of philosophy's most famous examples of God- Plato's God of the forms. Plato believed that this God ruled by transcendent laws that existed already, and transcended even God himself. This definition meets your argument, and therefore your argument inherently fails to provide any offense, and disproves nothing.	FAVOR
89	god	Yes, I do understand evolution perfectly well.  I'd be interested to see what you regard as credible research on intelligent design.  Wishful thinking is not a substitute for decent research.  At least Darwin did make predictions which came true.  Lord Kelvin (who was probably one of the pre-eminent physicists of Darwin's time) said that evolution by natural selection was impossible, because the Earth could only be 30 million years old, and there was therefore not enough time.  Darwin just said that Lord Kelvin was wrong; how spectacularly wrong is shown by the current accepted age of the Earth of 4.5 billion years.  Lord Kelvin was wrong because he didn't know about radioactivity (no one at the time did) which was was keeping the Earth warmer and throwing off his estimate.  I have no doubt that those who don't accept evolution will be shown to be wrong for the same reason, except it will be because of deliberate ignorance rather than inadvertant.  Intelligent design is just a theory.  It makes no predictions.  I'd be interested what your university training was, and how much actual teaching you have had of evolution or even biology.  Evolution is completely compatible with religion.  Francis Collins quite happily accepts (theistic) evolution, and the Catholic Chuch doesn't insist that Genesis is literally correct, equating creation with the implantatation of the soul in humans.

I thought that was a wonderful movie and you tied it into your argument nicely so I marked you up a point for it.To clarify my argument, I understand that eliminating religious beliefs will not be the end-all solution to the world's problems, and that people will always fight and try to control one another, however I see religion as simply another tool or motivation to fight. I believe that eliminating religion from the list of things to fight over could only help.To address what you said about uniting behind a common ""god"": I believe that it is natural for humans to have differences, and that society must find a way to embrace those differences instead of repressing them with religion (or other forms of absolute unity such as authoritarian government, etc.) It may sound nice to have everyone united in feeling and acting the same way, but it is simply not human nature to do so, and history shows that these sorts of feelings only breed more intolerance toward those who don't fall in line. The sort of logic you are arguing for is the same sort that Hitler would have used to explain himself. That society would be better if we all just felt the same way towards everything, and that we were all united behind a common government (or religion in this case). The point I'm trying to make is that people are different. Their moods and opinions are always changing, and the way to cope with this not by eliminating diversity, but finding a way to embrace it (i.e: democracy)"	AGAINST

All I know in my heart is that it's wrong. You're asking me why... I don't know why.. I do know that it's wrong though.. and it goes hand in hand with this 'downward spiral' in todays society. 1 thing though, I don't do anything because God says so. I agree with Him... not follow Him blindly.Thing about right and wrong - There is no proof to it. That is one thing I can garauntee you 100%. It's purely opinion or one's own thoughts. Science has no morals. Nor has facts. Morals, right and wrong does not go hand in hand with numbers, statistics and tests. Morality is outside of explanations through science. Sometimes you do things for the sake of doing. You don't question everything. Some things you can question... and still do it, some things you question and don't do it, but questioning everything is just as bad as not questioning everything.	FAVOR

I mean if god exists i guess zues and buddah do to.

So the pharaoh says the gods have spoken and if they didn't do it they would go to hell and die over and over again and this would put fear in the peoples eyes, i also the reckon the bible is a fairy tale and just been taking out of proportion.

We discover new vitamins each year, we argue global warming (now safely named ""climate change"" because of the cooler past 10 years), we struggle over dark matter theories and time/space challenges... what makes us think we can rule out God when we don't understand.  You claim that science has always found evidence.  I politely disagree.  I believe there is much more we don't know than what we assume we know.  The latest theory of the universe is that our section of universe exists in a time-space bubble, different from the rest of all that exists.  This would explain the behavior of forces we can't understand, as though we are seeing through a ""glass, dimly"".  Apparently, the scientists biggest problem with this otherwise plauable explaination is that it would mean that the earth, and our portion of the universe are truly special, unique.  I guess that this scientific theory would come close to saying that it may be as God said after all.  (not that any understanding of the universe is contrary to an understanding of God).

124	god	A scientist comments on Rabbi JerritÕs 3 conditions:1. Theories of, or beliefs in, a Divine source for the Universe constitute the longest standing range of explanations for the source of our world. I guess that it is a basic tenet of science that this fact has no value whatsoever. Countless ideas have longest standing (e.g. the sun goes around the earth) yet are wrong.2. Theories of, or beliefs in, a Divine source for the Universe constitute the most agreed-upon range of explanations believed by human beings Ð throughout history and still today.This is a testimony to the limited education that has been available to human beings. The comment about 1. applies here, as this is simply another statement of 1.3. Each and every other explanation for the source of our world is lacking in one fundamental area; they cannot explain without significant problems on the one hand, or an articulation that resembles one of Divinity without the label on the other hand, what existed prior to the world. The existence of a God, without beginning and without end, spatially or temporally, solves this problem.The first sentence is true. The second is trivial, and IÕm much more comfortable with the curved space-time general theory of relativity description of the universe, without beginning and without end, spatially or temporally. Evidence  Text The Expanded Quotable Einstein ÒI want to know how God created this world. I am not interested in this or that phenomenon, in the spectrum of this or that element.

Hell: what better way to make little children behave than by terrorizing them with stories of being tortured for eternity in the fiery bowels of the abyss! Belief in God makes parenting a breeze! This also works for controlling mentally handicapped people!4. Purchasing Redemption: everybody makes mistakes! Sometimes you just can't help murdering all those innocent children and then defiling their remains. But wait! Have no fear! You don't have to go to Hell! All you need to do is ""Purchase your Redemption"" from the Pope or any one of his representatives. Although, this option is no longer available in the present day, there's something even better!

It's like that Jehovah who died because she wouldn't take a blood transfusion.I think the basis of your argument is that God's word cannot be applied to modern day society and in a way you're right, because the world is moving so fast these days that every decade shows more change than it used to a few hundred years ago and that half the things today aren't even mentioned in the past i.e. abortion, cloning etc. However I would say that it's only people's mentality that is different to the past.

140	god	"There are a lot of arguments about the existence of GOD. Some try to prove scientifically and logically. What we need to know is that GOD is so much much bigger (beyond our imagination) than what we can think of. We cannot limit GOD with our (limited and simple) mind. GOD creates everything, there is no way that the created being can think about the CREATOR. In a simple analogy we can put it this way, a computer programme cannot explain about the programmer unless the programmer put it in the programme he or she wrote. The same way is with our GOD, unless GOD reveals to us (humankind), there is no way we know or understand about GOD. The other thing that we need to know, we live in a different dimension from GOD. For this reason we cannot enter the other dimensions. Talking about poverty, sickness and all the problems in this world we cannot avoid not to talk about sins. To explain about this we need to refer to the original sin (as what is written in the Bible in the book of Genesis). As we know, GOD so loves the world that HE has given HIS only begotten Son to die for humankind. From here we can see that GOD wants every single human being to be saved from ""the dead"" (eternal separation from GOD). When GOD walked on this earth in form of humankind like us, HE also experienced all the sufferings known to this world. So, HE perfectly knows about this. Another thing we need to know is that life is more than ""walking"" on this planet (which is only a very small fraction of the ""real"" life - in the life after). After all if we really want to know about GOD, we simply need to ask GOD to reveal HIMSELF to us so that we can understand what is beyond our (limited and simple) mind.By the way, if you are interested in knowing about this futher, based on my experience, there is an excellent book that explain clearly. The name of the book is ""The Progress of Redemption: The Story of Salvation from Creation to the New Jerusalem"" by Willem Vangemeren (you can look at the internet).Finally, what I can say, if we really ask and humble ourselves, GOD will definitely reveal HIMSELF to us in HIS own way."

148	god	"In order to answer this question the first thing we have to agree upon is on our views of human nature or on the potential of human nature. It seems as the belief in God for the greater good is correlated with the belief that human beings are evil and that have no potential to do good unless they have some belief in a supernatural force. Contradictorily, most religions are based upon the notion that man is a ""fallen"" creature that needs to be redeemed through rituals, or some sort of metaphysical connection to a higher being. Religion and the belief in God are sustained by the thought that we are evil. The situation we are in right now religions have preeminence in dictating moral standards. Thus, the basis for our understanding of human nature comes from the religious basis that we need some sort of enlightment or redemption to be restored to a higher plane. In this situation the only way to achieve a greater good is through God. thus when yuo say ""people turn to atheism and do what they want,"" you are assuming that this means they will turn into some sort of savages. This is not true. This is just based on your conception of human nature which comes from religion. I would like to see an interpretation of human nature that is not based on religious premises.

This is the epitome of selfishness... doing whatever you want as long as you don't think it affects anybody else.This whole delusion you've got about how all religious people follow God blindly is again wrong. If people didn't know why they followed God, if they were just mindless zombies who had no senses themselves then why is it that theists are able to argue for their religion? Some even give a different interpretation... some change things altogether. There are many ignorant theists out there, but they tend to be from poor countries, limited education and live simple lives. Apart from them all theists follow such laws after thinking them through. You're saying arguing which religion is right is absurd?!??! This is what people do with differences. They clash. It's not just religion.. it's race, ideology, philosophy, politics etc. EVERYTHING.So what's wrong with this 'soul saving excercise'? Give some examples cause I don't know wtf you're chatting.However, when we are talking about society, we have to make laws based on factual evidence, not subjective feelings about things. Yes people make a ""moral"" choice about things, but this choice doesnt necessarily have to be based on fairy tales. It can be based on scientific evidence.Here comes your warped ideas about people again. You're telling me moral choices only come from fairy tales. Seeing as you don't believe in fairies... you don't have an morals. According to you. People's moral choices aren't based on fairy tales. Fairy tales are in accordance to their moral choices. (Remember I said this earlier...). People are generally against murder. These fairy tales are against murder. They're both against murder. People aren't against murder because fairy tales are against murder. You cannot make a law based on science without judgement outside of science. I've written why before... if you didn't understand it I'll explain one last time.Let's have immigration as an example.Law requires legal migrants.. not illegal immigrants.Science tells us the positives and negatives of immigration.OUR OWN JUDGEMENT will decide whether or not we want immigration and to what degree. This judgement is outside of science as science cannot make decisions.. only explain them to a certain degree.So drug dealers are bad because of your reason? Not because they're selling substances that harm your body in the long term, cause addictions which leads into other trouble. Not because of that. Only because it's outside of the government's economy. NO!Belief in god entails faith, and faith is the ability to believe in something without evidence. ...(more and more bs i've already talked about.... Maybe you are just trying to hold on to your subjective believe that you need god to know what is good or bad for you.Firstly I've already said to question is good. However doesn't mean you've got the right answers when it goes against your religion. You might sometimes... but I doubt it. To question doesn't mean to go against. So when you believe in God.. doesn't mean you believe whatever anyone else tells you. Maybe that happened to you or somebody you knew.. but not in the majority of educated religious people. Science on the other hand doesn't teach anything. Science does nothing. Science is basically theory. Theory based on logic, evidence, statistics, solutions etc, but it is theory.The problem is that people assume that it was meant for societyNO! you see that is where you are wrong. When people are happy, good (on a personal level) then it means society will be happy and good on a personal level. That is plain logic. You've got it wrong about the Jews and Jesus. Or that Satan story. That Satan story doesn't mean shit about God or that the world doesn't belong to God. It's the same as being a customer in a shop and telling somebody to steal something. It's temptation.. not a bargain. LOL! You're such an amazingly smart, good, morally absolute person yet you don't even understand the simplest of stories. I'm not even Christian, nor do I agree with a lot of it's practices yet at the least I understand what I disagree with. This shows that you don't understand where you stand. You've got a deluded idea about religious people based on your own personal, limited experiences.Saying you cant smoke a joint because god wouldn't like it, is retarded. Saying that you shouldn't smoke it cause it kills brain cells is a different kind of choice.NO!!!! Again you're wrong!! Even though I can understand where you're coming from, you're wrong. If you believe, trust and have faith in someone you follow them. Even though you don't always know why, you follow their reasoning because you know that they're right. So when people say it's because God wouldn't like it... it's because they truly trust God and think that what He said is right. You're trying to ask them to question God. How the fuck can you do that? lol?!?!I have no problem with you being atheist... only your reasoning. You have a very limited imagintion, perspective, experience, narrow and understanding of matters.

156	god	"so whats your point? that everybody should hear two sides to every single story they hear?The point is to illustrate that more information about a subject leads to better judgment on it. Ideally we should refrain from emitting moral judgments when we don't have enough information. The point was on how information, not the subjectivity of religion, leads to better judgments. thats because you are talking to religious people using religious answers Evidently, this is your case, as you are trying to pose a defense for god. On questioning. Questioning should not be ""overcome"" as if it was an obstacle. Questions just need answers. When religious people seek answers in prayer, the answer has a high chance of just being a subjective personal intuition. If religious people would really look for answers they would have to start by first questioning the very existence of god, and requiring proof. you cannot say one has a better law just because it doesn't agree with your ideologyOf course it is possible to judge whether an ideology is right or wrong, just as it is possible to judge the morality of anything else. Laws that do not give equal treatment to it's inhabitants , are laws that lack a good morality. When slavery was accepted, for example, the definition of citizen was not applicable to the slaves, as they were not awarded the same rights. I do not agree with it, not because of some ""personal ideology"" but because I believe all human beings to be equal. In your example of a country that bans homosexuality, I would also find that rather disgusting - how can it be right to judge a person by what he/she does in bed? are they harmful to society? how? Anyway, thank you for showing your low level of maturity. With this, I abstain from the ridiculous debate that you have created. But again, I don't have enough information to judge you as a good or bad person as I lack the information about your age, your educational level, and the degree of your faith. ... ;-) cheers. And I didn't need god to tell me that pre-judging a person is bad... Or maybe if I had god then I could make a quick prejudgment and say you are a bigot."	AGAINST
157	god	Well seeing as their cults I wouldn't really look into them too much. I did some research into them and they do seem completely different to Abrahimic faiths. I would certainly say that Eastern religions are based on philosophy with them being more interested into the understanding of one self in correspondance to the universe. Mythology, history, culture and philosophy I would say are basis of eastern religions also with the founder having lesser significance than abrahimic faiths.	FAVOR
158	god	"Contrary to the attempts of the religious to make an epistemological equivalence between naturalism and supernaturalism as equally arguable hypotheses to explain nature, there is no such thing as a presumption of naturalism.You are a human being.  You have a definite nature, possessing specific characteristics and capabilities, including a human means of gaining knowledge of the world in which you exist.  This includes seeing by means of looking with one's eyes...and so on for all the senses we possess...and a rational capacity to identify things by their fundamental characteristics and to form concepts in order to hold our knowledge indefinitely.We are not anything but human beings and, thus, have no other means of gaininging knowledge of the world than our human means.So, if you open your eyes and see nature, that's where your knowledge begins.  There is no mental blank until you first choose your starting assumptions.  There are no assumptions that nature, which you see, is nature and that you, somehow, choose to see it onlly in a natural way.Nope. No presumptions whatsoever.  You open your eyes, you see what's there and you begin to mentally organize the evidence provided by your senses into groupings accourding to similarities and differences.You don't start building your knowledge with nature because you chose that as your presumption.  You start building your knowledge with nature, because that is what is there.To go the bizarre and cogintively misguided direction of attributing things that are there to supernatural, meaning unobservable, causes, is what requires an extra action of choosing an assumption, one which veers away from what you observe.  Notice that all arguments for the existence of God or for any version of the supernatural require a very abstract organization of concepts and, upon examination, it turns out that there are NO observations which bear out that presumption, nor do the abstract arguments hold to the tests of logic.So, naturalism is nothing more than human beings gaining knowledge of nature by human means, without a naturalist presumption.  It is supernaturalism which requires the contruction of a presumption in order to selectively bring observables to the task of proving what is not a valid idea nor an observable reality.Notice that this argument against the ""presumption of naturalism"" argument required nothing more than the fact that you exist with a specific nature as a human being, including a specific capacity for gaining knowledge.  If you wish to quarrel with my argument, you must deny those facts about your existence."	AGAINST

166	god	"I just woke up, unable to sleep, thinking about my art. I wondered more about the Christian worldview on art, and so I hopped on the net to research it. Ironically, look where I wound up? This is the very first time I've ever participated in an online forum, but this site, with this question on God's existence struck me, so for the first time everÑI'm jumping in. Go gentle...Have any of you ever really asked God whether He exists, and if He would reveal Himself to you? He will. (And the ways in which He will are numberless.) But it's true, you have to genuinely want to know about Him. For many years, I was an atheist. But God kept putting these ""Christians"" in my path. I constantly wondered about ""Him."" I was a very logical person. In fact, thought I knew a lot in general. Christ is particularly interested in those most of all. And I had all the arguments down pat for his non-existence. But something kept bugging me. You see, God was ""calling"" me. He doesn't ""call"" on everyone, but any of you that think about this discussion seriously and have ever wonderedÑconsider yourself ""called""... I did my research (being the ""logical"" person I was), and in the process He revealed Himself to meÑwhich coincided with my research. Here was ""THE truth"" I'd always hungered for. Turns out He did exist. And it's the wises thing I ever did or will ever do.The ""science"" thing: Here's what I contend: Do you really think an explosion of rocks created sapphires, the Caribbean Sea, Edgar Allen Poe, the cockatoo, the catfish, Lucille Ball, an apple tree, the dolphin, the giraffe, tulips, the marshlands, Degas, olives, Michael Jordan, the stars in the sky, and you? Nah. Not without something far superior touching it (and with purpose!). That is far more fantastical to believe than the Bible, any day of the week.The ""evidence?"" Look around you. It's everywhere, every day.And bottom line. As C.S. Lewis so brilliantly put it: Whether you believe in Him or not won't change the fact of His existence.Just think about itÑkeep your eyes and heart and ears open. Peace."	FAVOR

168	god	We can't fully place our faith in science, because it is continually changing. The theory's and truth's of 100 years ago are not always considered truth 100 years into the future. I think it is questionable to fully rely on the thoughts and beliefs of man for we have not obtained full knowledge and will never obtain full knowledge of all things. There will always be unexplained matters in our existence. It's almost like we are lost on a weird country road, but do not want to stop and ask for directions because we want to do it ourselves. Although we may never find it and it would be a more pleasant experience if we stopped and asked for directions, we want to see it with our own eyes, so we never stop thinking we might be heading in a totally wrong direction.

As far as the Texas thing I familiar with that being a part of the bible belt no one objected it was only one person who complained and affected the rights of hundreds that preferred to pray. Overwhelmingly the community was upset what happened to democracy even in religion where the wants and needs of the many out ways the needs of the few.

175	god	If you truly believe that, you are a lost cause to the world. Take some time to reevaluate who and what you are. I don't care if you have a faith or not, but when you help someone, it should be because it's the right thing to do, not because the magic sky daddy will punish you if you don't do the right thing.If living for yourself is so easy, then do it. Prove to the world that without a god you have no moral fiber. Prove that you're just a sheep, and that's all you have the potential to ever be. And when they forge into the future, they will condemn your name, and the names everyone like you.Perhaps there is no god, but even so, life is a precious gift. If you feel like there's no reason to live it without a god, then you're fucking useless. You have ignored Jesus' message. I wish you luck.	AGAINST
176	god	"Yes, there can be no good without God. With out an author, everything then becomes a matter of personal preference and interpretation. There is no objective standard by which to judge things. You can't ask the maker of the product how it should be used. It means man has no purpose for which he was made and therefore there can be no deviation from a norm.  But worse than that is if there is no life after death, then justice becomes a sham. Those who go on shooting sprees and then take their lives escape justice. Hitler escaped justice and got off. But the worst thing is that our lives become pointless and without meaning or value. If we come from nothing and return to nothing, folks we are nothing. Our lives have no value. Then there is no difference between gassing termites and gassing 6 million Jews. That ought to scare any sane person. Because then you become a commodity for the state to use and consume for it's purposes. There is a correlation between Communism and atheism. For further proof pick up a copy of The Guinness Book of World Records and check out the greatest mass murderers of all time: Atheistic regimes, Stalin, Mao etc etc. There is a reason Russia is experiencing a surge in religion. This question is not a theoretical one for them; they know the answer from first hand experience.I do however think the greater question is why do we have to protect ourselves from ourselves. Take the Ten Commandments, it ought to stagger us that God has to tell us not to murder and steal. Wow!! that ought to be a given. We shouldn't have to be told not to do those things. And then to be threatened with punishment knowing we will do those things. Something is amiss at the very core of who we are. Laws can't help us because as soon as they get in the way of what we want, they get broke. And it's painfully obvious religion can't help either; it just becomes a facade we hide behind to justify our actions. Others simply turn to atheism, they close their eyes, cross their fingers and hope no one is home in the universe and proceed to do what they want, when they want. Others still will try to plead ignorance: "" I really want to do this and If there is a God I'll just tell Him that I didn't know that it was wrong""Folks, we need to be saved from ourselves, we are the problem. And when you are lost in the forest the worst thing you can do is ask yourself for directions."	FAVOR
177	god	People who need a god in order to feel they should follow the laws are literally sick in the mind, and they should be isolated from the rest of the world. They lack real, concrete morals and a decent understanding of the world. We should not feed this behavior, because if they ever snap, they become extremely dangerous.Instead of threatening people with the wrath of god and eternal hellfire, we should explain why love and understanding is important. We should explain to them that we are all in this together, and without empathy and caring(the Russians played out a sick experiment to prove this one), we would die. We should explain that when you help someone, you have helped yourself. We should explain that pain and sweat are necessary to survive.Most importantly though, we should explain that the only part of them that will be left here when they die is what they did, and your actions are a mark on you for eternity, god or no god.Recently, I have begun to believe in a higher power again. I don't know what it is, but I do know this:What Jesus was trying to get people to see was the value of freedom. The power of numbers, the power of helping, the power of love, the power of caring, and why it matters. Most people see Jesus as an icon who was crucified for being 'too awesome' or 'too great'. They killed Jesus because he was trying to teach people what it means to care. I firmly believe that if there is a god, and he is the christian god, that he wants people to act with moral integrity for the love of the world. Not because there's a hell. People tend to get that twisted.Please for everyone, Kindness for Kindness sake, not for heaven or hell. Tread the noble path with noble intent, and you are truly a good person. Tread the noble path because you're afraid of being hurt, and you're a fucking coward.Whew, that's all I have to say about that.	AGAINST
178	god	Why do people continue to bring up Pascal's Wager?Firstly, it completely ignores the fact that there is an infinite set of possibile gods, and therefore the chance of you believing in the right one is infinitesimally small.Secondly, it doesn't explore the possibility that the god that does exist either doesn't want you to believe in him, or punishes people who believed in the wrong god more than he does people who simply didn't believe in any god.Thirdly, it assumes that god is an idiot and can't tell the difference between people who actually believe, and people who are believing just incase.Living by Pascal's Wager is a foolish way to live.

179	god	What does it take to decide what is the greater good. You need a moral agent using logic and reason to asses a current situation and then to judge that against a perceived standard. The only thing in that string of events that is physical and made up of matter is the moral agent, but it's morality,logic, reason, assessment and judgment are not. To put it another way; you can't open it's head and see it's thoughts. They have no projection in space; a characteristic of matter. And don't tell me it's like computer memory because every one knows what happens to your hard-drive when you put to much on it. The last time I checked, no ones head gets bigger the more they know ( well I guess it does in one way) The point is that these are non-physical realities. And no they're not the product of chemical reactions, you can mix water and baking soda all day and the bubbles will never talk to you.Point is this; If atheism is true than we have a whole lot of stuff that shouldn't be here. A lot of non-physical realities in a purely physical world. A lot of stuff that atheism can't account for. Well, they can if they use those non-physical realities to prove that those non-physical don't exist. Oh whoops, darn it that's a self refuting argument.	FAVOR

I would rather point out that your inability to prove the origin of life, the origin or very nature of the universe, the irrational behavior of forces in the universe that lead us to flip-flop on our publicly held opinions regarding ""the beginning""- these at least leave a door open to the possibility that someone else is in charge.

Once people were incapable of proving that the world was round so did that make it flat? There is also archeology that coincides with the bible.

Those who believe that God doesnÕt exist have just as much FAITH in the matter, because there is no hard core evidence that proves the belief that God doesnÕt exist.	FAVOR

I feed my kids because I love my kids, not because God tells me to. Even if he did not tell me to, I would still feed them. It's the right thing to do.One example. Adultery. You tell me is it right or wrong? Those who have thought of or have actually cheated will say its right, but those who haven't will say its wrong. Can we make a decision on whether or not it should be punishable? In the end, God says its wrong. I think He has a better idea of whether or not its right or wrong.

191	god	You argue, as do many theists, that human ignorance about the development of life, the nature of life, or any other aspect of reality, constitutes proof that a god must to explain that which is otherwise unexplained.  This is the worst and most desperate kind of argument.  Just because something is unexplained does NOT mean that it is inexplicable.  It only means that it is NOT YET explained.  Human intellectual history is nothing if not a consistent set of evidence that, given time, ANYTHING is explicable by the power of the rational human mind.  Remember, the sun, moon, and the Nile river used to be considered gods because no other explanation was evident.  Those gods DIED when science explained them.  So it will be with the Judeo-Christian-Muslim god, as well as all others, when the light of human intellect exposes the shadows that your religions require in order to thrive.

Moral is based on judgment, opinion etc. It's not a religious thing either, but right and wrong is not science. Science is simply an explanation of things.You commit suicideScience says you are dead. Morals say it's wrong (or in certain culture it's right).Science can't judge whether dying is good or bad. It can only state what happens. Morals are judgments.It's kind of silly to say religious people do not base their morality on evidence..lol.

But I understand your questions about the variety of belief systems and the confusion over whether or not God can be known.  I have to say that personally (I believed at one time that there was truth in all religions), I never knew God until I got saved and met Jesus Christ.  I knew He existed- I just didn't know Him.  In your search, you might find it helpful to ask those of the various religions you know about their relationship with God, and ask them to describe how well they know God.

197	god	You seem to miss the question at hand. The question is not can you or do you have morality, I agree you do and can. I also believe you can come up with all kinds of reasons for it; which you clearly prove you can. The problem is that all the devices you use do it; reason, logic, your mind, thought, reflection, moral assessments etc. and the morality, ethics, rules etc you come up with are not characteristics of matter nor are they physical in nature.  The Atheistic worldview is purely naturalistic by definition and asserts that matter is all there is. It therefore can't, by definition, have non-materlistic things in it, like logic, reason, morality, ethics etc. So your use of such things disproves your assertion and confirms mine.So then the grounding question becomes critical. To form a correct view of the world one must have an adequate explanation for the things he finds in it. Otherwise your view will be inadequate and quite possibly incorrect. So I assert that your worldview is woefully inadequate to explain all of reality. And is therefore faulty because it's scope is to narrow and explanation far to simplistic.I've included a link to another book for your consideration.

208	god	If you gain, you gain all. If you lose, you lose nothing. Wager then, without hesitation, that He exists.--Blaise Pascaland to be honest it seems it would take just as much faith to believe that there is no God, that when we die were done and gone, as it does to believe in one. The reason why people have always come up with different religions and theories is yes, to search out an explanation of the universe and its contents. But, instead of seeing this as a pathetic foolishness that you seem to, it appears to me that it is the amazing inborn reactions humans have to discover where they have come from, where they go to, and why they are here. Perhaps we feel we have to find answers to these questions because somewhere we know that there's more to this life.	FAVOR
209	god	Saying that   science   disproves   god   is an asinine statement. What has science proven that the earth revolves around the sun and that all living things are made of atoms and such. religion has never claimed to have the answers of why things are the way they are. Holy scriptures are written by man and they transform it as they see fit. But this is not definite proof that there is no god. science can only prove what is seen. There are many things going on in the universe that are unseen look at black holes we know they are there but we can only speculate on how they function. As far as science has gone it is really only within the scope of our corner of our galaxy. Which is a tiny fraction of the whole universe. We see things on such a small scale that most of the things we have proven may not conform to the rest of the universe. We don't even know what is at the very bottom of our own oceans how can we claim that we know if there is a divine being or not. There is no proof on either side just because there is a god does not disprove science and vice-versa. As speculated(and i mean a theory that is currently trying to be proven) the universe is moving apart. Scientist have known this for a long time the universe is expanding right now but they assumed that one day that the universe would collapse in on itself. Scientists now believe that the universe is expanding and will continuing expanding for eternity since gravity loses its strength the farther objects get from each other(duh). So this puts a big question on the big bang theory. Scientists believed that the mass that existed before the big bang was from the universe before and that it collapsed in on itself. And since our universe seems doomed to expand forever it seems that this first explanation will not fit the mold. So what was before that mass that the big bang strewn out. We may never know. But saying that there is a scientific explanation and only a scientific explanation. Is like saying that since there is life on earth that it came from a meteor( i'm not sure this is a good analogy but i couldn't think of a better one). We know so little about the world around us that it is stupid to say that on the little information we have that there is definite proof that god doesn't exist	FAVOR

I am rather embarrased of the ignorance of men. Anyways, this has to be the most silly question in history-if you're educated and have any sense of moral sense you would agree. If the world wasn't created by the Supreme Being (GOD), than how else would it have gotten here. If any one person (or organization) expect me to ever believe that Earth one day just decided to appear in space and isolate the water from land and create it's own self a moon and set the sun impeccably in it's place and everything revolve and correlate in it's proper manner every morning-day-season-year etc""I really do not know where to start. This line ""if you're educated"" is later followed by an admittance of a complete lack of knowledge about the formation of Earth and the moon. I mean seriously, you could TiVo National Geographic for a week and have a basic understanding of all the ""scientific mysteries"" you mentioned. You call people who disagree ignorant when it is you who choose to subjectively ignore information and evidence. Information and evidence observed by man, not created by him.Riddle me this. It's is a known fact that the distance between the Earth and moon is increasing by 3.8 meters a century. Eventually it will leave Earths orbit but the effects will be felt long before that. If our solar system was created by God why would he put an expiration date on it? Our Sun isn't going to last forever either mind you.Another thing that has always bothered me is why is there so much else out there? Why would a God create so much noise in the universe when we are his main concern? In the old ideas the Earth was the center. If everything did revolve around us and we were the center of the universe (as was the idea when religions formed) then a Creator would seem like the obvious answer."	AGAINST

First of all you'd need to prove that god exists and that the bible is more than a poorly edited collection of inconsistent works of fiction.  Once you have done that, then you can come back and we can discuss whether god works through evolution or whether god is a deceiver (as Philip Henry Gosse in his book ""Omphalos"" published in 1857 2 years before the Origin seemed to believe) and created an earth 6000 years old to look 4.5 billion years old.

We should be asking ""Is there any reason to believe in God?"".  This is an epistemological question that relates to MAN'S KNOWLEDGE concerning the nature of reality.  I am open to the existence of a God, but only if I am presented with objective evidence that one exists; evidence that cannot be explained more plausibly by another hypothesis.  This view is common sense.  Arbitrary assertions are not true until proven false, they are false until proven true.  This is as true about the assertion ""God exists"" as it about the assertion ""invisible elephants live on Mars"".  The burden lies with those making the positive claim to prove it.  Hence, theists must prove God exists, and until they do, I have no reason to believe in one.  Of course, since faith is belief WITHOUT evidence, I'm not even sure why theists WANT to prove that God exists.  Proof would destroy faith.  Evidence would turn faith into science, and would reduce God to an analyzable PART of the natural world, demoting him from his position as the  supernatural Creator.  "	AGAINST

Invoking God isn't the slightest bit circular, and it doesn't mean that God must require a cause.  The law of casualty states that every effect (contingent being) has a cause.  God is not an effect, nor is God a contingent being.  The universe, on the other hand, is composed of matter, and the chief characteristic of matter is mutability (it can be changed).  So therefore, the universe is contingent and requires a cause.  God on the other hand, is an immaterial being who is comprised of no parts.  As such, He is irreducibly simple, and thus does not require a cause.  You can't just simply plug in the ""Who made X"" objection to everything there is. Your capitalization of the word ""universe"" strikes me as odd.  It's ironic in the sense that you're essentially deifying the universe, which is nothing but an impersonal, arational, and amoral reality.So in summary, God does not require a cause because God is not comprised of physical parts (divine simplicity), while the universe does because it manifests contingency (being made out of matter, which is mutable)."

254	god	"I'll pass on the book, but thank you. I read his bio though and it was interesting. I find the deist point of view more rational than the majority of theist thoughts.The problem is that all the devices you use do it; reason, logic, your mind, thought, reflection, moral assessments etc. and the morality, ethics, rules etc you come up with are not characteristics of matter nor are they physical in nature. Okay, this is like St. Anselm's Ontological theory. It was supposed to basically be a one page strictly cerebral proof of the existence of some god. It takes a similar premise which I think is provable, that humans are incapable of creation. Every idea we have comes from something we observe; and you can try if you like, it's kind of fun, attempt to imagine something new, a new fantastic creature perhaps, you'll find no matter how crazy an idea you come up with, it can be traced to things observed piece by piece. Everything is an exaggeration, or a combination of things etc, but it's all traceable to the real world.He took this basic fact of the human mind, and put forth the idea that man long ago came up with this idea of something ""greater than which nothing else can exist."" Since this is an ephemeral thought, and in itself it would seem to be untraceable, man must on some level have experience of it. Therefore, ""something than which nothing else can exist"" must be real. And this we call god, and then of course there's a million definitions and theories about this being, but at the center it must be based on some unknowable truth.He studied philosophical works, especially Socrates and Plato of course, and very much seemed to be influenced by the very persuasive argument that we exist with all knowledge in some form before birth, and at birth, we somehow forget, and learning is simply memory. It seems to be the same kind of thought process.Which is interesting.But my reply is simply. 1. in response to St. Anselm, we cannot really imagine ""something than which nothing greater can exist"" we simply exaggerate on to infinity, and describe it as such. Ex. I can say ""infinity"" referring to say just numbers. But I know that there is no such thing because one can always add a 0 at the end. At the same time, while I can say infinity, and can have a general concept of the idea while at the same time knowing it is not a real thing, really I cannot even begin to imagine really large numbers. No one can really imagine for example how many a trillion is. We hear that number all the time, but the reality is beyond our comprehension when converted to anything real. Yet, a trillion does not even begin to approach ""infinity"" and in fact, we run into the number ""trillion"" all the time, in the deficit, the number of stars, sand on the beach, etc. It's everywhere. But beyond our comprehension none the less.Now that obviously could be turned into a pretty sermon about god, how something can be in front of us, while we do not comprehend it.lol, and I just realized how cute a point that would be. Probably make a million turning it into a little poem or something - ""foot prints in the sand"" and all that :)but the point is, our ability to have what seem to be higher-level thoughts, ""reason, logic, your mind, thought, reflection, moral assessments etc. and the morality, ethics, rules etc"" as you say,are very much characteristics of matter and are I believe of a physical nature.So, 2. In response to your point I would say that these things are a part of the natural world. reason, logic, reflection, ethics, even the morality that began this entire sideline to the debate, are all things I believe that developed naturally in humans, and many many mammals with relatively large brains, from observing the benefits of this kind of social behaviour.A chimpanzee can learn (From ""Bonobo: the forgotten ape"") for example, that if he brings a lover food, she will have sex with him later. When he does not, she does not. So they learned to share. Even in them, this took a certain amount of reflection. These primates had to look at them self, and on some level say ""I want sex"" then, their actions in pursuit of what they determined through self-reflection appears, and may well be, morality.Through time, we observe the fruits of our actions both from our own experience, and with our capacity to imagine what others have experienced. This leads over hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, experience, breeding with those who act in a similar way, etc, generation after generation, to a people (us) who appear to have a capacity for morality, reflection, moral judgment,when the hundreds of thousands of years of the trial and error of evolution are not taken into consideration,I admit it can appear quite miraculous, and I can see how one may feel something ""greater"" must be an architect of sorts. Even if this architect isn't really around to talk to like deists believe.But given the progression over generations. I don't feel these higher-level human characteristics necessitate the existence of a greater being. Sure, they are not ""characteristics of matter nor are they physical in nature."" But they are results of physical nature, hundreds of thousands of years of physical nature.Now, to the debate. ""Is belief in God for the GREATER GOOD.""I do not believe it is. We are capable of all the good, and all the evil on our own, with or without a god. And I do not like one using god as an excuse for good or for evil. I believe it is people, always was people, and always will be people, and it is better to be aware of that even if it should be the case that people couldn't handle this idea. I think though they could handle it just fine though if t hey tried."	AGAINST

256	god	It's not just a matter of deterrents (i.e. policeman vs. boogie man). Most people seem not to understand that they are good to each other because that's the best way to survive! Or in the context of human society - have a chance of happiness. Without getting into a whole thing about how the media keeps you in a state of perpetual fear (much like the messiahs or priests of old and new) and why, or how a few rotten apples can spoil the whole batch if it seems that antisocial behavior can provide better results for an individual in the short term I just want to say - people are basically and statistically good. It's in our nature to be good. Just like it is to be scared, a fact that the media and religions rely upon with great effect to their bank balance. We need to make a society where there are less (ideally none) poor, uneducated, sick and in other ways unhappy people for no good reason. The question of deterrents, and which one is more effective will become moot. Until then belief in god is just holding us back.For a proof of concept look at Sweden. It's much easier to get a perspective on things by looking at empirical findings then following your intuition - i.e. throwing around arguments with no real data, making doomsday forecasts and alike.

280	god	There is something I would like to share with you in relation to the existence of GOD and the validity of the Bible. It is interesting to learn that until today the extinction of dinosaurs is still a big mystery to human race. There are so many theories suggested regarding this mass extinction; such as the climate changes, a big asteroid fell to the Earth, etc. In fact, if we look at the Source of the History itself, we will definitely find the answer to this question. Actually, back then in the time of dinosaur, the whole Earth (without exception) was covered by the cloud (waters) (GENESIS1:7) to protect it from direct exposure or radiation of the Sun. This cloud functioned as a filter and Òtemperature stabilizerÓ (like having central air condition in a house) for the Earth. As a result, the whole Earth had the same temperature everywhere (whether in the North Pole, South Pole or the Equator - the temperature were the same). Due to this condition, the vegetation and environment in those days were very different from what it is now. The Land was much larger and bigger than the Sea (not like today) so as to accommodate and support the lives of so many giant creatures like dinosaurs on Earth. The question is, how did they become extinct all of the sudden (not even a single one exists but the bones and skeletons)? If there was a major catastrophe struck the Earth, then how come humankind and small animals could survive? If there was only a certain part of the Earth was hit by a meteorite or an asteroid, then how come ÒallÓ the dinosaurs disappeared but not other creatures?If we look back at the History of the Earth (as told in the Oldest History book, the Bible), there was a certain time when there was a great flood took place on Earth. How could this happen? This could happen because the Dome of the Clouds above the Earth had been torn out and fell down in form of a big rain flooding and submerging all over the Earth (which was in NoahÕs time). As a result, the amount of water on the surface of the Earth had increased dramatically and formed what is called the Ocean. From this time on the size of the Water area has become much larger and bigger than the Land area. And at the same time the Earth has become too exposed to the radiation from the Sun which has increased the EarthÕs temperature drastically from what it used to be (which has left it without Òtemperature stabilizerÓ). From this time on, the temperatures in the North Pole, South Pole and Equator are quite different because they depend on the rotation of the Sun (just like in an air conditioned house when the doors and the windows are wide opened, certain places or rooms in the house have become too hot than the others). The same with the dinosaurs (if any of them survived from the flood), which used to live in a temperate world and environment, suddenly with the climatic changes had become too fragile and died out. Even for us today, with only a slight change in temperature due to the change of the seasons (from warm summer to cold winter) prone to get flu and other types of diseases, not to mention a drastic climatic change for dinosaurs which used to live in a temperate world. Consistent with the History as told in the Bible, only Noah and his family and all the passengers in the Ark were survived to live in the ÒNewÓ Earth. And for the first time they could see the blue sky right after the Dome of the Clouds had been torn down in form of a big rain which caused the big flood. Before the flood there had never been any rain on Earth because the temperature on Earth was stable and the same everywhere under the Dome of the Cloud. This is proved by the Rainbow which was the first time showing as a sign after the flood. Based on this it confirms that there was no rain before this time because rainbows will only appear as the droplets of water reflecting the light.Before the big flood took place (when the Dome of the Clouds was still intact), the age of the creatures was longer than today (they could live up to hundreds of years).The ancestors of Noah lived up to hundreds of years (according to the Oldest History book or the Bible).This could happen only because there was no radiation (from the Sun) which has caused aging process. In conclusion, all these things show to us the validity of what is written in the ÒOldest History BookÓ or the Bible. Even the Earth is round also mentioned in this book (JOB 26:10) far before the Columbus.	FAVOR

Our relationship continues on the basis of that mutual trust. That trust is it own reward. If we want God's benefits, it's only consistent with all other things in life that he should ask us to accept him by faith. He has offered himself as the reward of the one who will seek to know him by faith. It's a fair deal, and a very good one. No one is forced in. And he isn't trying to fill heaven by coercion. It's for the willing.Lately, the thing which has me awestruck is God's love of paradox (apparent contradictions that seem impossible, yet with a change of viewpoint, they resolve).

303	god	"There is. And every knee will bow before Him for judgment. Those who believe in Him will be judged differently than those who don't. When I pray to God, He in fact sees Jesus Christ standing in for me. He will see Jesus' blood. Jesus will then judge my deeds in terms of rewards after I passÑsome shall receive many rewards, some shall receive fewer, but all will be saved. Unbelievers, if persistent in their unbelief and unrepentant, will not see God. That is their final judgment. It's funny that atheists claim this as punishment (which is how I, a believer, do see it), but for the atheist, this is exactly what they wantÑthey don't want or have any need of a ""God,"" so why would they care if they're eternally separated from Him (which is what Hell actually is)? God gives them what they want.Plus a note: What is ""good"" to mankind is not the same as what is ""good"" to God. He's so good and so loving and so pure and so wise and so powerful, our best efforts at even trying to attain these things are ""but filthy rags to Him."" The only way He can look upon us is if He sees His son in our place, since His son is, was, and will always be, not just good, but perfection. Non-believers can do ""good"" or ""nice"" thingsÑthis does not make them unspoiled, perfect, obedient, or ample in true goodness. And, as I've said, believers, too, can be nice and charitable and whatnot, but without a genuine faith in Christ, this does not make them good."	FAVOR

I just wonder how it is that some people have a direct line to ""know"" what god wants and what god says. there is no reason to see Buddha , Jesus or Muhammad as anything more than just very intelligent guys who had a burden in their hearts to guide people into a right moral pathway. Anyone with common sense and enough passion, and charisma can do this. Ghandi did not claim to be speaking god's words. he did claim to be inspired by the words of said prophets but by viewing their words as what he called ""pure thoughts"". why do you have to bring a ""god"" into the picture? morality has no need for god. 2. the words of the prophets you cite have value, but i feel that because they claim to be god-sent, their words become meaningless. people then have to choose who to believe... was jesus the son of god? or was he just a prophet? ... then religion becomes more than just about morality but about being ""right"" with some ""god"". does the mother of your example have to tell the kid that she is letting him fall because god told her to? why cant she just explain the logic behind it? it is enough.... we know that we shouldnt kill because it is common sense! not because we have to believe in someone who tells us that god talked to them last night. Since you do not want to use religion, then explain how the idea of god, outside of religious norms, is tied to morality. it seems that more than defending the need for having a creator/god, you are defending the need for organized religion. God could be viewed as something more sublime than an organized set of rules written down by some privileged men who had some sort of direct phone line to the all-mighty.... in my opinion morality need not to be tied to god. your argument is very confusing. are you defending religion, or god, or morality as means for the greater good? ... it seems to me that you believe that religions are legitimate creations of a god. if this is the case, this will be my last comment to you as there are too many contradictions in religions, in their norms, to even begin to accept that a higher being would have given them to us for our ""guidance"". if there was a higher being he probably has nothing to do with religions... and i repeat... morality does not need to be tied to a god. there are lot of ways to be educated into the ""right"" way of behaving that do not require having someone telling you that you will go to hell if you don't obey."

If you look up the history of Catholicism about 300 A.D. Constantin fused together pagan and Christianity there you have the whack Catholics. I cut and pasted from Wiki below. Look I know the argument is not about a specific religion like the one I believe in. Yes if you encompass all religions that call themselves Christian than yes your death statement is correct. A lot of cults out there call themselves Christian but they are a wolf in sheep's clothing just like the Catholics are making up there own rules and laws.Ancient Roman religion encompasses the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Rome in the form of cult practices. It is therefore the practical counterpart of Roman mythology. Within the Roman world, religious practice varied enough so that one might speak of Roman religions. The cult practices of Rome extended across Italy with the rise of the Roman Empire. These religions were polytheistic, and as such are sometimes referred to as ""pagan""."	FAVOR

This includes religion, it is a made up story that someone thought up a long time ago before the theory of the big bang or the theory of evolution to explain why we are all here, they did so because most people in earlier  times were simple minded and could not  understand the scientific terms for why we all exist. Assuming we exist regardless of our lack of understanding, everything in our world is flawed, man 's ultimate flaw is how naive he is to the environment in which he was placed. To be honest there is no way to prove that god exists, but someone once told me that life is much easier to live if you have faith in some thing much bigger than your own existence. God only exists because people believe in him. Other than that there is no solid proof, i personally don't see the evidence of his existence anywhere, but there has to be something else out there to explain the strange fate we are all on the path to meet. I believe that if there is a god he is cruel , that he placed such a flawed creature in this environment to, watch it react purely for his own entertainment. Man is ignorant, therefor man is his own downfall.	AGAINST
314	god	Faith IS truly required to believe (i.e. KNOW in one's heart) that God exists.  Yet, Faith in faith alone gives little comfort that Faith will one Day be proven to be fact.  Faith THAT God exists is based on the presuppositions that God can exist, and that His existence is beneficial to me.However, by the same token Faith is required to believe that God does NOT exist!  The Faith that God does NOT exist is based on the presuppositions that the Universe can exist even if God does not, and that the lack of God is in some way or ways beneficial to me.Though I will probably add another comment later, I will close this one with an investment-return analysis!Belief:  God exists!   Investment:  This Life with all its problems & blessings...on average 100 years or less.   Return:  Eternity of significant existence minus problems plus additional favor for believers.Belief:  God does not exist!

Return:  A Life of pleasures that lasts for 100 years or less, and the possibility of being immortalized in the hearts of those who adore you, even though YOU yourself cease to exist.Cost-Benefits Analysis shows heavier value on the side of Belief in God and His certain existence!

Many of the same people, who reject God, or Creator, can easily phantom infinite parallel universes, intelligent beings from other planets or even galaxies, but not a Creator.  For me, God has always been the only plausible explanation for life.  If you really study the Bible, you'll find that it must be divinely inspired if only because of the obvious logical sequence obtained by so many authors over so many years.

Sadly, this has not been scientifically proved that Gods do exist.No offense but I feel that this is a propaganda to make people devoted to one's religion. See, you go to Churches or the temples and pray, study the bible, etc. But are they really true?Just like what many people say about Jesus-- he wanted to save his villagers so he sacrificed himself and got pinned(literally hammering his hands and feet) onto logs which make up the letter ""t"" and was left there to bleed to death. [Sorry if I got the wrong story but it should be something like that]How true is this? No one can reassure. Any one can just make up stories with no prove and evidence. It depends on how much or how far one believes in that so-called story.For me, I feel that Science explains almost everything. Without Science, one will not know why or how things work.

Which he synthesized from the   ten commandments   each of which represented one of these two concepts from Jesus.1. Love truth and righteousness above all else.2. Love others.William Booth the founder of the salvation army was forced to synthesize it even further when asked what ONE word would he leave to his followers.

Debate the topic, not the person.I agree with you on most of your points about what science and research are.  I'm an engineer, not a scientist, if you care to draw a distinction.  So, I know science changes when consensus changes.  God's laws of nature don't change, but the human understanding of those laws changes via peer review.  No need to go back to Aristotle.  Just go pull some textbooks off the shelf from the 1930s.Yes, conservation of mass and energy are not up for debate here.  This debate is about God.  He is free to violate any law of physics he wants, since he created them in the first place.  Look at the elegance of the universe. How could that have happened by accident?  Also, if we hold to the fact of conservation of mass and energy, then how did the big bang happen? Faith and Science are two very different things.  God created the laws of nature that we call Science. No doubt, he has violated them a few times as serves his purpose.

My point is that it is so irrelevant and anomolous with humankind's history, especially when it comes to religion, it should not hold any strength and if it does, it shows that religion needs to be in place to stop people from doing that... (as they did it on scientific reasoning)Facts are facts, but they can be used subjectively. The thing about saying we need to know about everything before making a decision is impossible and tbh says that as people we can't make a decision. ANY decision we make, we will never know the impact of it, not only is it because we can't see into the future that would have been, but also we can't see everybody it might've affected.I personally believe sodomy is wrong.

Children look like their parents not because their parents chose to make them that way but because they passed on a set of their own genes. Children sometimes act like their parents because they were exposed to a certain mindset,   environment   and ideology. Why, then, would the God of the Bible choose to expose us and command of us violence, hate,   racism  , sexism, but not even bother to suggest compassion in, say, his Ten Commandments? Why would he share with us only a few attributes but not all, if we are truly made in his image?It seems, as usual, the theist conclusion has come not from evidence and logical reasoning first, then conclusion, but conclusion first than a half-hearted attempt at evidence and logical reasoning to convince others of the conclusion.

Of course mammals and other modern taxa evolved over hundreds of millions of years from much earlier sea-dwelling organisms. It's the ""hundreds of millions of years"" part that's crucial here, mate. And no, there's no reason that there would be more animals with higher-level thinking capabilities, although in fact there are good arguments to be made for a number of animals having varying degrees of ""reasoning"" power -- gorillas, chimps, elephants, big cats, and even parrots are quite bright compared to many other critters: bright enough to measure on ""our"" scale to the point where we've seen higher-level thinking behaviors akin to our own in all of them (examples include: use of sign language, use of sign language to communicate experiences that happenned prior to the acquition of sign language, primates teaching other primates to sign, the ability to identify one's own reflection as being one's own reflection, emotional expression, representational image-making . . . the list is really quite extensive). Also, dolphins are the only animal in the fossil record to have both more complex brains and a greater brain-to-body-size ratio than we do, and we really haven't a notion what they're up to with all that grey matter. But that's not really the point, since evolution functions so that better-adapted animals will, over time, reproduce more succesfully and, over greater amounts of time, diversify further.

If Freud had been right Ð Shy would have been pure superego    She hardly ever spoke and used to write anything she wanted to say in a little pink notebook.  She had beautiful cursive handwriting, and wrote so slowly that it would drive anyone nuts.  She had no malice towards anyone, even her rapists and abusers.  She was at peace with her small existence, and understood what would happen when her brain would start functioning better and she would die.  One night we were having dinner with some friends.  Shy was eating with us.  We started talking about God.  Finally we asked ShyÒIs there a GodÓShy thought carefully for a moment.  The table went silent. Finally, she smiled and carefully wrote her answer and showed us her notebook.No.Then she thought for another moment, leaned across the table and whispered her first words in months.ÒBut there should be.Ó	AGAINST
363	god	You can't convince a group to hate people who are different when you are different.  Hitler was evil, yes, but also intelligent.  Once he was in power and had the Germans firmly united behind him, he quickly phased out that pesky Christianity business.  If you accuse some one of being like Hitler based on his brief stint as a Christian, you can say make the comparison to just about anyone.  He was a man, for example, and a veteran, he was Austrian, and he even happened to be part Jewish.  Do you really want to say that all men, veterans, and anyone who is part Jewish are like Hitler?

370	god	"Lol.. low level debate. Thanks luv, now I know it is actually good.Ideally we should refrain from emitting moral judgments when we don't have enough informationSo how much is enough information?? Do we actually know enough about anything to make the right choice?? You can only make a 100% correct judgement once you know EVERYTHING.. not just about one thing, but everything about everything... i.e. omnipotence. Because with that knowledge you would know the reaction to your action 100%.When religious people seek answers in prayer, the answer has a high chance of just being a subjective personal intuition. If religious people would really look for answers they would have to start by first questioning the very existence of god, and requiring proof.Ofcourse it MIGHT be subjective personal intuition. Someone would only every give their opinion. If somebody came and asked you about God, don't tell me you'd say He exists... or give strong points to His existance. In the same way youve got as much subjective personal intuition.. even though I know you like to think you don't. Religious people tend to be religious after having looked at answers or accepting answers. Nobody is religious without thinking about it atleast once in their lifetime.Slavery - You're telling me it's wrong?The economical benefits they provide.. manual labour.. make lives easier for their owners etc. I'm not one to agree with it.. but you con't tell me there's no positives to slavery.I do not agree with it, not because of some ""personal ideology"" but because I believe all human beings to be equalContradiction. Believing all human beings are equal is an ideology.In your example of a country that bans homosexuality, I would also find that rather disgusting - how can it be right to judge a person by what he/she does in bed? are they harmful to society? how?It's disgusting to you?? Homosexuality itself is disgusting to me. Not because of God or what my parents say. Again when it comes to gayness.. my reasoning will seem absurd and easily arguable.. but I think I'm right when it comes to it. But YOU reasoning that people should be able to do whatever they want to aslong as they think it doesn't affect anybody is selfishness to the maximum.I'm a bigot huh? you're obviously completely tolerant of religious people.

372	god	Granted that science never 'proves' theories, it merely rejects theories which have been falsified, but that's kind of a minor clarification.You have to admit that the above comment (while poorly constructed) does have a point insofar as the existence of an omnipotent being would mean that the so-called immutable laws of physics would be more like traditions of physics given that they could be 'over-ruled' at will.  If the object of science is to whittle away false theories in order to leave behind the theories which can't be falsified, then the existence of an omniscient being would defeat that purpose (since it could falsify any theory).

We're supposed to go there. We're supposed to go into space, to explore, to learn and to discover. Humans are supposed to spread out and see new sights, reach new horizons. When we get on a boat and sail halfway around the world, when we build submarines and underwater research labs--when we walk to a part of town we haven't been before, we're doing what we're supposed to do. That's a part of the human condition. G-d just made all that stuff so that we'd have someplace to go next. When that's all explored, I have no doubt that there'll be some other world to discover.

381	god	"It is good to get back on track. ;) If they're NOT, then why have they 'used' God?I honestly think that the answer is a simple lack of education. Whereas before people had to be threatened with floods and the wrath of a god to compel them to change their ways, now that we have more understanding about the world, we are able to find logical conclusions as to how we should act in certain situations. we are now able to think more critically about issues because we have more knowledge. Regarding the questions you post on the thou shalt not kill example, using the concept of god inhibits our critical thinking about how to solve such situations. The ""word of god"" is usually not enough to address such issues about euthanasia, abortion in case of rape, killing in war, or self defense. I seriously doubt that god will tell us the right answer no matter what. Whereas we can be allowed to arrive at logical conclusions about the issues of killing on a case to case basis, I dont think that we can know god's answers about these issues based on things that were written hundreds of years ago. Unless, again, you can prove that you have a direct line to god and that he is telling you what to do. This would be very subjective and you would have a hard time applying it to all of society. There was a case in Nicaragua a couple of years ago, where an 11 year old girl was raped, and because she had reached puberty, she got pregnant. In Nicaragua, people believe that the bible is the word of god. Churches of different denominations interpret this word for the people. However, the god had not mentioned anything about what to do in this situation... no mention of abortion. So churches, who claimed to know what god was saying, launched a fierce campaign against the abortion of the child... based on the fact that if the bible (the word of god) said thou shalt not kill then this applies in any situation and we shouldn't think critically about each issue and respond to it accordingly. The girl was 11 years old and incapable of taking care of the baby. The family of the girl lost the support of the community because they wanted the daughter to abort. The girl did not even understand what was going on. .... Anyway, just an example of how claiming that god says something can not be for the greater good. If the girl asks why she shouldn't be allowed to abort the answer will be because god says so. This kind of answer in itself is detrimental to the advancement of our own development of ethics and morality.I don't claim that educated people make good choices all the time, only that when we have more knowledge about situations, our choice will be more informed and this expands the possibility that it will be a better choice than an uninformed one. If we become more informed then we will solve the problem of just being like children who do not understand and need to follow blindly . This may have been the case in times when people thought that the world stood on pilars, but now we don't need more myths, we need more education so we can think critically about the impact of our desicions."

384	god	We could blog here all night and all day for years on end and it comes down to this simple conclusion:Atheists believe God does not exist, they are putting their money down on no eternal life. Their payoff they believe is humans living in reality while alive for their short time here on Earth. Here is their problem, what if God does exist? They have basically doomed themselves, its their payoff they have been afforded all the information of Christ and have decided that it is mere folly.Christians on the other hand have taken the 50/50 bet. If God doesn't exist they have lived in a fairy tale land for the last 25-50 to 75 years. But given their religions good precepts they have at the least lived a decent and kind life. But then comes the payoff, He does exist, they reap the rewards of their faith and achieve eternal life.I'll take the later. There are no lasting payoffs for Atheism. I'd rather not pay a huge price for the honor of science and theories. What if the atheists theories are nothing really more then explaining God?

This is a value comparison essentially between a persons life, where they do believe, and a person's life where they don't believe.There is no way to qualitatively measure the worth of someone's life without factoring in happiness and suffering. Would the person with no belief in God suffer less than the person with faith? Would the person with no faith be happier, over all? I don't think the question can be answered. No matter which way you look at it, though, it's life, and there's nothing greater than life... Life with or without the belief in a god is still life.

Some of this dust also made the sun.How did all of this matter come to be?-Billions and billions of years ago, at the beginning of time, there was the Big Bang, where an extremely dense piece of matter that held every atom in the known universe- the size of a pinhead maybe. All of the energy there caused it to explode and from there, galaxies and solar systems were born.Where did the small piece of matter come from? or Why did the Big Bang happen?If you can logically come up with a scientific answer to this, then you are absolutely amazing.

398	god	I think we can see this by looking at previous questions which were answered by appealing to the supernatural. In response to the three components:1) Theories of, or beliefs in, a Divine source constitute the longest standing range of explanations for phenomena like weather, disasters, and other events that have natural explanations. Looking historically it is almost certain that far, far, more people have used divinities to explain things like lightning than have used the modern scientific explanation. Even today, it is possible to find people around the world who hold similar beliefs. The mere fact that a certain kind of explanation has been popular doesn't mean that that class of explanations are good or true.2)A similar point goes for #2. I do not see how he could possibly believe point #2 to be relevant. Theories and beliefs of a divine source for the human species likely constitute the most agreed-upon range of explanations believed by human beings, both historically and today. Regardless of what the good Rabbi's view on   evolution   is, he surely doesn't think that the question of whether evolution is true or not can be solved by polling people. It doesn't make any sense to try to determine if evolution is true by counting the number of people who believe it or don't believe it. Why then, would theories about the origin of the universe be any different?3)Even if current (naturalistic) theories about the source of the universe suffer problems, this is no reason to assume that a divinity must be the answer. As I stated in #1, previously unexplainable phenomena were also explained using supernatural beings. The fact that at various points in history humans didn't have a natural explanation didn't make a supernatural explanation the correct answer. I also am curious as to how exactly God is supposed to solve the problem of existence. It only seems to raise the question of why God exists. If we assume that God simply always existed, why can't we assume that the material universe always existed (albeit likely in a rather different form prior to the big bang)? In other words, if existence requires explanation, then God's existence also requires an explanation and simply saying that God always existed answers nothing; if existence doesn't require explanation, then there is no need to appeal to God as an explanatory force at all.

399	god	This discussion in about a belief in God.  Yes, science is about observation, pulling together a consensus on what can be observed, experiments that can be replicated, and peer review.  God doesn't fit into this neat little, man defined box, called the scientific method.  So, the whole idea of using science as a method to answer the question of whether God exists is silly.  God has a plan for everyone, but it is up to each individual to have enough faith to believe it.  Using science as a justification to not believe in God is folly, but those who don't have enough faith to believe won't realize it until it is too late for them.  I wouldn't call it wishful thinking.  The beauty and massive complexity of God's creation is enough for me to realize that none of this world or universe could exist by accident.	FAVOR

417	god	Whether a construct labeled ÒGod,Ó by humans as an explanation for the origin of the universe exists, or its attributes been accurately described, appears of little import. There is no reliable set of procedures to govern its behavior or its effects on humanity. This is not to say that such constructs have no value There are many theoretical constructs that we put to everyday use Ð electricity, atoms, electrons, etc. I find it very difficult to justify making an unmanageable, invisible, and unobservable phenomenon so much a part of what motivates people to think and behave as they do. Specifically, teaching children to rely on, pray to, or make requests of this construct seems particularly unproductive.Just as new learning in evolutionary biology have opened our understandings of both human motivation and behavior, so too are we discovering that both core morality, and a propensity to respond to supernatural explanations for events is deeply wired in the human brain.

419	god	 Although I never really was religious to begin with, in recent years I began to lean towards a sort of skeptical agnosticism. However, if pressed to choose a side, I would certainly consider myself a basic atheist. I really don't believe in God in the traditional sense-I don't believe that God is an old bearded guy sitting on a cloud that can poof a donkey(for example) into existence. I just feel as if there is less and less reason for me to buy into the snake oil that organized religions try to sell me. I feel very good about my beliefs(or lack thereof)-they feel right to me. However, I am not the stereotypical depressed, bitter atheist that you may see in your mind's eye-far from it, in fact. There are so many other good things to believe in, what should keep me from getting up in the morning?	AGAINST

422	god	First off, the mightiness of God does not at all determine his existence; simply- no matter what God is or does, he either exists or does not, and attempting to disprove the bible's God by showing what it inherently is (which does not disprove), doesn't disprove all definitions of God. This being said, we must realize that the utmost strategy of this argument is pathos. It tries to turn your emotions of wanting God to be all powerful into a conclusion for atheism. This argument completely skips logic. Logically we can see that if God exists, and he can in the framework of the bible despite these observations, then atheism is not the best answer. The argument presented here assumes omnipotence and the bible, therefore atheism. It fails to provide ANY logical warrant. It completely skips every other argument, and the simple fact that the arguments are not mutually exclusive. It therefore fails.	FAVOR

You cannot prove God, just as much as I cannot completely disprove God. This argument will lead no where. My point is, if you argue for God's existence based on the bible alone, then you have a flawed argument. The bible was written by men, so it is flawed itself and not reliable. One more thing, here is an interesting correlation. As science has improved and knowledge increased, religion and god become less and less fact. Interesting, yes?	AGAINST

435	god	My entire family and friends circle is religious and believes in God, but I do not. Being this really IS an ambiguous question, if we did this statistically with the world's viewpoint, it'd be what? 90:10? Something of that sort, and thus God exists simply because 90% of the world believes he does. As I said, even though I'm not religious, I spend a lot of my time analyzing the origin of religion and how and why people prefer it so badly. I personally don't think he exists because I overall don't care. I don't see a point to wanting to believe he exists, because I'm completely fine as a human being without his existence to me personally. However, I also think he is merely a mythological creation. We've got all those fairy tales that make up the world of Disney, that are so incredibly famous because they all have one thing in common: a happy ending. And that's why I think people cling to religion like they cling to a good fairy tales... because the idea of death and dying sucks so much, everyone likes the idea of life continuing on... in heaven! The land with no boundaries! But really, in a sense, I'd believe in God the same way I believe in Santa Clause, but I'm too rationalized to see the point in doing so.Also, like someone else said, I believe the idea that the bible and religion were started when they were because perception was limited. In the times of the bible, there's not one mention of the planets, or microorganism, and that was because they were out of their ability to see. Instead, they decided a sickness was granted because of God, or a meteor was punishment because of God. It was an easy way to believe why everything was happening... because of the act of just ONE entity.Now, if anything I said was truly accurate, my only question is why all these religious people don't step out of their boxes and agree with me. But they don't. And that alone makes me question how wrong I could be about it because can 90% of the world really be that... different? That close minded? That much of a follower? But then again, everyone thinks Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth too, so maybe it's a lost cause. 90% of the world just really might be that alike.	AGAINST

Yes, the chances are very small that something will successfully evolve which is why it takes millions of years for new species to arise.For example, the monkey family has an extra set of chromosomes. WELL GOD MUSTA DID IT! No, occasionally in evolution, a set of chromosomes will become fused. Chromosomes have end caps on them to tell RNA where to stop coding. Chromosome 3 in our genome is actually a smashed together 15 and 16 from the monkey family, proven by the matching DNA and the site on the chromosomes where there are two end caps are illogically joined.

Aside from your rather strange attempt at claiming that popular belief in some kind of   god   gives the idea credibility, I've seen no such attempt by you. Most theists at least try to come up with a logical argument to make their pre-existing beliefs seem viable, but you seem to have given up before you've even started!Instead, you've apparently come to the debate with the arrogant conclusion that you don't need to make any serious attempt at rationalizing belief in god. Why?Your claims about faith seem a little odd as well, less of an argument and more of an excuse. Why, if you are so willing to believe and base your life off of faith in a god without any evidence, why not believe in anything without evidence? Don't believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster? Why not?

Problems involving irreducible complexity, the impossibility of forming proteans from amino acids without the guidance of DNA, the huge gaps in the fossil record among others are starting to be reasoned upon. Although many in the scientific community have posed counter-arguments, these often have minimal empirical evidence and are usually the result of a macrocosmic repression of the implications of these anti-evolution arguments.Although neither I nor anyone else can easily prove the existence of a God in a tangible way, Intelligent Design is quite evident and provides a much more scientifically sound argument than the statistically improbable and flawed reasoning of the evolution argument.Unfortunately, it is so easy to only see the evidence which is most convenient for us, thereby leading us to a divided scientific community, and thus divided society on the matter of the existence of God.

He's pretty bright.I know I understand this debate just fine.but your description does indeed show your hand that you believe in a god. Though attempting to be altruistic in that you say as your example the author of a religion does not himself believe it,the assumption of the reasoning behind an author of religion if there is no god to author it them self (that people were out of control) is both unknowable, and quite debatable.There is no way to know if 1. whether people ever stopped acting out of control because of the introduction of a god. 2. whether people would stop acting out of control because of the introduction of a god as opposed to any other method of persuasion.The assumption that even if there were not a god, there must at least be a reason to believe in a god,is a deep deep indoctrination within all but a small small percent of humans on earth.It shows you believe in a god.I submit that laws work just fine in and of themselves. People do not need now, and never have needed a god or hope of eternal life or fear of eternal damnation.

It is two thousand years old and over a billion people live their life according to the standards set forth in said book. Books should always have more editions, especially for one that hasn't gone out of print for the last two millenia. It doesn't tackle issues like healthcare, the environment or a democracy. Even if it does, it barely goes into any detail.

Which is a tiny fraction of the whole universe.ÓScience can observe the entire observable universeÉ and in doing so we see that the laws are consistent.  We can observe the chemical composition of distant stars, and even observe the motion of planets as they orbit other stars.ÒWe see things on such a small scale that most of the things we have proven may not conform to the rest of the universe.ÓAs stated aboveÉ what we observe is consistent, the laws we see here on earth are the same laws found in the Andromeda galaxy and beyond.ÒWe don't even know what is at the very bottom of our own oceans how can we claim that we know if there is a divine being or not.ÓYes, but that same logic says we cannot claim that there are no elves.ÒThere is no proof on either side just because there is a god does not disprove science and vice-versa.ÓScience is just a process, not really something that can be proven or disproved.  However the evidence of itÕs accuracy is right in front of you.  The computer that you are using to read this was built and operates on Scientific principals.ÒAs speculated(and i mean a theory that is currently trying to be proven) the universe is moving apart. Scientist have known this for a long time the universe is expanding right now but they assumed that one day that the universe would collapse in on itself. ÒActually that was never the consensus.  The collapsing universe was only one of three considered outcomes (the other two being equilibrium and infinite linear expansion).  ÒScientists now believe that the universe is expanding and will continuing expanding for eternity since gravity loses its strength the farther objects get from each other(duh).ÓThe current theory is that the rate of expansion is increasing.ÒSo this puts a big question on the big bang theory. Scientists believed that the mass that existed before the big bang was from the universe before and that it collapsed in on itself.ÓThe Ôcyclical universeÕ hypothesis never moved beyond itÕs preliminary stagesÉ and was not universally accepted (though it was seen as a possibility).ÒBut saying that there is a scientific explanation and only a scientific explanation.

People do things ""because god told me so"" (no matter what god that is) without questioning why or really thinking for themselves. Scientific reasoning (I do not mean just science but perhaps the use of the scientific method) can lead us to find a ""greater good"" in a more objective way. Why is homosexuality wrong? Why is sodomy wrong? A better measure would be to check whether or not your actions are harmful to you or to others, and then measure your behavior accordingly. This is better than just ""god told me to do it"" which leaves the issue open to having any god tell you any kind of crazy thing ""god told me to go kill the abortionists"". There was actually a case a couple of years ago in one state about a pastor who killed a doctor that was performing abortions. And the congregation supported him. Im sure you will say ""well, that is extreme, bla bla bla"" and make some excuse about how those people were not true followers... but the thing is, religion is subjective and it is left to ones ""relationship with god"". How do you explain to that man that killed the abortionist that his relationship with god is not legitimate? How would YOU argue for that? Do you have a direct line to god? things get easier if we have the means to determine whether our behavior is harmful to ourself or others. Now science can tell us a lot about how to behave in ways that are less harmful to ourself, to the environment, and to society in general. The bible does not say anything about protecting the environment, which is an issue of importance to all of us. But in my personal identification of ""right"" and ""wrong"" I say the overuse of pet bottles is wrong, because Ive learned the effects they can have on the environment. - Just an example. What greater goods have come from the belief in God? I want you to explain to me how religion is NOT subjective. When followers have to listen to a pastor/priest interpret things for them. Or when followers constantly justify their own behavior with an explanation that all that matters is a ""personal relationship"" with God.

Without question Ma'at is in favor of those who follow her laws; without question Juno is in favor of wronged wives; without question Ishtar is in favor of gettin' it on. Those are neat points too, but like yours, not real relevant nor provable as actual fact.Our founding fathers built this nation based on God . . . written into the constitution Well, then, I am REALLY confused as to just what Article VI and the First Amendment are doing in our Constitution. Because the only mentions of ""religion"" that I remember in the Constitution are the one that starts with ""Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of . . ."" and the one that reads ""no religious test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office."" And the word ""god"" doesn't appear in the Constitution AT ALL.I hardly ever see or hear about agnostics giving anything to any charity.I hardly ever see or hear about Christians who aren't pathological. Following your line of ""it's what I want to see therefore it must be true,"" all Christians must be looney-tunes. On the other hand, I know tons of Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Bah'ai, neopagans, agnostics, and atheists who volunteer in their communities. I'm most certainly not a Christian and I volunteer. Do you actually know any non-Christians upon whom to base an opinion about which religious communities are and are not doing charity work?It's a given fact the Christians . . . It's a given fact that the Christians make crap up and claim it's a given fact. For this we actually do have proof: creationism, for example.If tomorrow God came down and took all the the believers away . . .. . . it would do wonders for the economy. The rest of us will divvy up your property and take your old jobs.But that aside, if tommorrow all the Christians disappeared with their wrongheaded notions about how humanity is at the center of creation and is destined to ""rule"" the earth but is also somehow innately flawed because their god doesn't know how to make people properly, the world would tick along just fine, and I firmly believe that humanity would be far better off without that particular collective delusion. when something bad happens like 9/11So . . . the Christian god and Osama bin Laden sided together on the whole 9-11 thing. Doesn't that sorta suggest that your god has converted to Islam?At any rate, it's pretty ludicrous to assert that if everybody just claps their hands and says ""I do believe in fairies"" loudly enough that your god will keep anything ""bad"" from ever happening. Bad things happen to pretty much everybody, Christian or otherwise. I would hope that your quest for faith would lead you to something with a little more depth than ""eek don't let anything bad get me.""I mean, seriously, did you just put forth the argument that you worship a being who would blow up a building in a fit of pique because not enough people like him? I realize your religious mythos includes Sodom and Gommorah and all that so perhaps it's not inconsistent, but honestly, your god sounds kinda like Timothy McVeigh there, bud. That's not praiseworthy, that's morally reprehensible.Your point there reminds me of a story an anthropology professor of mine used to tell.This professor lived and studied among the Karen people of Tibet, whose traditional religion is more or less a mix of polytheism and animism. One day some Christian missionaries happened along. The Karen don't prothelytize, so at first they listened politely to the missionaries and then told them it was nice that they were so excited about their god. Then the missionaries suggested that the Karen should worship their god too, and the Karen elders weren't so keen on that idea.So after much talk, one of the missionaries told the Karen elders a parable. ""There was a great boat on the ocean, and one man on it was a Christian; and the boat was capsized and sank, but God saved the one Christian man.""So the Karen elders told the missionaries that they wanted to talk among themselves about this parable for a bit, and they would come back with their answer at the end of the day.At the end of the day, after meeting together and discussing the Christian parable, the Karen elders called for the missionaries and told them: ""After discussing your story all day, we have decided that we are not impressed. We have considered the matter very thoroughly, and we are convinced that our gods could have saved all of the people on the boat."""	AGAINST
478	god	Whether or not there is a god doesn't matter.  There is, or there isn't.  What matters is whether the existence of god is relevant to our lives.  Obviously, if there's no god, it is not relevant.Just as clear: if there is a god, we can never know its nature (or alternatively, we can only understand god through faith without proof; same thing.)  This is the only possible way to explain the complete lack of real evidence.If there is a god, but we can never know its nature, then the only way we can get some relevance from god is to believe in a version of god that is relevant.  But this version is a complete guess!  That's self-delusion; instead we ought to just think honestly about what is morally right and wrong.Another way to think about it: if god's relevance is to give us a moral code, then either the moral code is right in itself (in which case we don't need god to get it) or, the moral code is arbitrary and we should ignore it.

I should not really be writing now...but I just want to say a couple of things...the belief in God or a god or gods is quaint. There is now extensive neuroscientific ""evidence"" for ""god on the brain"" which neither proves nor disproves anything much...but it is interesting to see how the brain functions. I take all human knowledge to be human constructions (we can only see what humans can see; we can only hear what humans can hear etc etc). We can only think or imagine what humans can think or imagine. Anything beyond the scope of our brains is by definition unknowable. If there was a god we could not possibly know it. In the same sense that no human being can possibly know everything that is going on in the universe. God, is apparently, bigger than the universe, after all he, she or it made the universe, so he she or it must be bigger (in some sense) and therefore as a mere humanoid I cannot know him her or it. And it would not make a blind bit of difference even if he she or it did exist...the world is just the same...Hamas, Al-Qaeda, the US military all still exist, they are all still torturing and killing each other. All the people doing compassionate loving helpful things in the world are also still there. If god is there or if god is not there...there is no difference. Perhaps, the new US President will help bring some peace into this world, I certainly hope so, but even he cannot bring a non-existent god into existence."	AGAINST

I haven't really got a problem with athiests except when they think they're intellectually superior because they're athiest. They think that only ignorant and stupid people believe in God, and smart person knows that holds no basis, but it's different to say 'there is no God' than saying 'I do not believe in God'. Same goes to theists who say 'there is God' rather than saying 'I believe in God'.Thing about being more educated, it doesn't mean more common sense, which in that video you showed yourself, people are loosing these days. I would say in general the way people are educated, raised these days, they don't have much common sense. That I would say is more important than any education in the world.My argument about the extra inter-species breeding, part lion shit is to do with today's mentality of 'if he wants to, then he should' or 'if it doesn't hurt anybody...' etc. It's a downward spiral that will only lead further and further from the strict 'man and woman have sex for kids'. A bit of leeway is ok. But in todays society... homosexuals? transvestites? transexuals? zoophilia? necrophilia? Where does it stop?? There isn't a limit because we're loosing morals to 'science' or i would say 'freedom'. Right now, zoophilia might be looked down upon, but give it a few years and it will be today's transexuality. Understand that freedom isn't always a good thing. It comes with it's negatives.You're right about that Jesus camp thing. That is brainwashing and I think a lot of Christians themselves would be against it, but it is not God who inhibits the ability to decide for yourselves, but he definately gives the best path and it is for us to decide whether or not to take it, but in the end karma always comes back around. If you have lived a good life (whether or not you believe in God) you will be rewarded and if you have lived a bad life (whether or not you believe in God) you will be punished.It's not ignorance if you agree with God or to have faith in God's word. Take me for example. I know that we would live in a much better world without alcohol, yet I drink it myself. People argue against drinking it. At best people say it should be drunk responsibly. I personally agree with that, yet in my religion you shouldn't drink any. I've had many bad experiences with alcohol.. I'm pretty sure everybody who has drunk it has. Now, would you be better off without alcohol or with it? I SAY without it, yet ACT with it. It's not just God said so... but He is right? Same with smoking (except I don't really smoke).	FAVOR

Does all of this disprove the existence of dreams? One person may never in their entire life dream... does this mean that no one dreams? The truth to this entire debate is that every argument can be answered logically and infinitely, and therefore no logical decision can ever be made. It all has to come down to faith. Either faith in atheism, or faith in theism. That is the key to decision. But how does one acquire that faith? The only way to acquire faith in either direction is either to close your mind and convince yourself, or open your mind, and ask.

493	god	"Science tells us accurately about the effects of certain actions. E.g. smoking, drugs, alcohol, homosexuality, unprotected sex.... etc. But people are still free to make decisions. So sometimes, you have the contradictory cases of doctors who know how harmful it is to smoke, but still do it to themselves. In religion, you run into the same contradictions all the time, especially in cases that in my opinion are more delicate in terms of morality because they are more fragile. The difference is, that religious people have no way to argue for why they should do right, other than to ""praise god"", and then they try to impose it. Christianity is not the only religion. Contrary to your view, there are many gods out there and many types of followers. And the main thing they seem to care about is to argue that their god is the right one, in order to justify why they are following such absurd laws without really thinking them through. In this scenario , how is it that belief in god is for the greater good? which god? Because of religion we are always focused on some sort of afterlife and soul saving exercises that take our attention from establishing a better society for all of us. I think it is an unnecessary distraction, all this god talk. Now going back to science. People are still free to do whatever they want to their bodies, because they own them. However they are not free to do whatever they want to their neighbors body. Thus, it would be absurd to say that a doctor who is smoking in his bedroom is breaking a law. It would be absurd to impose that on him. Same with drinking. Only religion imposes some sort of virtual punishment to these people (here or in the afterlife) taking away their personal freedoms. However, when we are talking about society, we have to make laws based on factual evidence, not subjective feelings about things. Yes people make a ""moral"" choice about things, but this choice doesnt necessarily have to be based on fairy tales. It can be based on scientific evidence. However, what if the doctor was smoking in a public place? In Japan they are already passing laws against smoking in public places (train stations for example). Why? Because we know that second-hand smoke is harmful, and so it makes sense to sanction those who want to harm others with their behavior. Murderers also do things that are harmful to others and should go to jail. Drug dealers, the only reason they are doing something wrong is because it entails an economic transaction outside of government regulation. In Amsterdam, marijuana is legalized, based on the scientific study of the effects, and no one is prosecuting the owners of coffee houses for selling it to costumers. A lot of moral laws of religion overlap with common sense (at least in the christian religion) but a lot do not, and they lead to hatred and discrimination based on nothing more than subjective claims that ""god doesn't like it"". Why is homosexuality wrong? Belief in god entails faith, and faith is the ability to believe in something without evidence. Once you believe in god you start to believe whatever else anyone tells you (including the voices in your head - which are not always good) , and then we are steps away from becoming sheep. Science on the other hand teaches us to question. It gives us facts and then we can know what effects it will have for society. Of course science can say how drug abuse affects a country! Im talking about the scientific method of reasoning. Social sciences based on statistics and other forms of study deal with these problems everyday in every university. I think you are underestimating the value of inquiry and critical thinking. Maybe you are just trying to hold on to your subjective believe that you need god to know what is good or bad for you. In my opinion belief in god does nothing for society. NOTHING. Religion puts a focus on things out of this world in order to give people a drive. Is this good? It is, on a very personal level. The problem is that people assume that it was meant for society. Thats where the Jewish had it right in wanting a messiah who would come and liberate them from the political oppression. And they got rightfully pissed off when they realized that this great Jesus did not give a damn about the world here. He cared about souls. Jesus did not accept the temptation of satan when he offered all the kingdoms of the world. remember that story? What does that tell you? that the world belongs to someone other than god. that god's laws do not apply to this world. that this world is better run without religious beliefs. I also grew up in a christian environment and i feel i know the religion pretty well. But I really find religion and faith lacking in ways to help society improve. They help people be happy, find reasons to live, thank god in the midst of trouble... but leave it there. Denying homosexuals of the right to marry because god sees it as wrong, is bullshit. It is called discrimination. Denying women the right to abort because the fetus has a soul, is another bullshit that we cannot prove. Saying you cant smoke a joint because god wouldn't like it, is retarded. Saying that you shouldn't smoke it cause it kills brain cells is a different kind of choice. Use the bible for yourself. or the Koran. Or buddhist texts. Stop eating meat if god tells you. Cover your women. Tithe 10% of your salary to the church. go ahead, but dont say these things make society better. because eventually what religious followers have to be concerned with is to know and prove others that their god is the right one. that the bible is the word of god. not the koran. argh. The example of a pastor is an extreme one, amongst many of the same nature (but not of the same level) of how people interpret their god given missions differently. sure the bible may not say that. but the bible doesnt say a lot of things either and people read into it. also it happens to say a lot of other stuff that makes no sense but people believe it blindly. i mean, have you ever seen a soul? honestly?? why do you blame that pastor? if religion teaches us to connect to some being outside of us and obey? i think all believers in god are deluded in different degrees. the killer pastor, just another one. anyway. im tired of arguing because it clearly seems to me that you already have your faith based point of view, wanting to see that god's laws indeed apply to this world just because sometimes they overlap. the fact that they do is not enough to continue with such fairy tales. we know have evidence about many things, so we can use our reasoning to value whether or not we should take the blue or the red pill."

The way scientists would date soil is by the age of organic matter in it by means of carbon-14 dating, and for this dating to correspond with the biblical chronology it would have to be reliable.  Which would mean that other dates given by C14 dating would also be correct including the ones of 40,000 years (which is at least 6 times the biblical age of the Earth).  I don't know how reliable the science is (I did a Google search, and the only links were back to your comment).  I'd be interested if you could provide a link to the report.Hezekiah's tunnel was rediscovered in 1838. So there wouldn't have been many scientists (not even Darwin) who would have been able to use its non-existence as evidence of the falsity of the bible.  It would hardly be surprising that Jerusalem would have had a secure source of water, in case of a siege, and the bible mentioning a real structure hardly makes the rest of the book correct (you might as well argue that since ""Harry Potter"" mentions King's Cross Station, then the books must be true, because the station also exists; come to think of it, I have been to King's Cross and seen a wall between platforms 9 and 10 marked platform 9 3/4, with a trolley embedded in the wall-so they must be true!)."

495	god	"I think again, to dispute the assumption that im saying people now are smarter than before is wrong. Im saying people now have more information than before, and more information leads to better choices. Of course egyptian, mayan, and chinese civilizations developed at an amazing rate and with surprising quality for our standards. But the eqyptians were also burying their dead in huge tombs (the pyiramids) and along with exhorbitant amounts of gold, why? because their belief in gods entailed a belief in an afterlife. I think they could have spent their resources and time building other structures that would have helped their community , rather than tombs. (though now we admire them just for cultural value). So it is these kind of behavior that I argue stems from a lack of knowledge about the world and how it works. However it doesn't mean we are ""smarter"" now. Since there are religious believers who continue behaving in the same supersticious ways... When they get sick they pray instead of going to the doctor, etc. But these behavior now should be inexcusable because now we have more knowledge about the world, so it is more like a choice. Back in the time of the Mayans, it may be more acceptable for them to come up with rituals to call for the rain, since they dont have the scientific knowledge about what makes rain fall. But now, when people engage in the same kind of things, it just makes no sense at all because there is more knowledge out there about how things really work. As far as morality goes, I actually think that something like the hamurabi code where the crime was punished in direct retribution, was quite innovative and logical and we could benefit from it. If you steal, we will cut off your hand. End of story. No need for god to induce people to act morally. ;) Just a good execution of the law. Of course this is not the ideal... and again, things are never just ""black and white"", so in the end it may not work in our day. The ideal would be for us to think critically about our actions. To have an awareness about the common good. We dont need an image of ""god"" in this, just as we dont need a hamurabi code. We need something more complex.... a reform in the educational system for example... Belief in non-abrahamic gods for the greater good. hmmm. that makes this more interesting, but still based on my argument above, you can deduce that the image of god is unnecessary. We all have an understanding of god that is different from each other. And there is no way of proving which god is right. Groups of people, cults, have come up with new ""gods"" and then followers are so blind that they end up committing crazy things in the name of these gods. Think mass suicides. This is the problem with the concept of ""god""...any god, impedes rational thinking."	AGAINST

497	god	"Look kids! He started with the watchmaker argument! Please, please, please, stop using arguments that have been proven to be flawed over and over and over! This is the problem that theists have when convincing atheists that there is a god of some sort, you don't use good arguments.Anyway, to disprove that argument, we recognize that things like jeans, laptop, and WATCHES have a creator because that's the culture that we've been brought up in. We know that they have a creator because there's no method through which they could've come together other than that. But for the complexities of our bodies, the spiders, and the sea shells, we have explained methods by which they reach their complexity (evolution).The main problem that I have with the watchmaker argument is the inherent fundamentalist theistic blindness that it displays. On the surface, it simply shows the theist ignoring scientific evidence (which is a bit of a euphemism, I've realized. Let's make this clear: evidence means we've SEEN IT HAPPEN), but then you dive deeper and it shows how much the belief in a god (I didn't capitalize it because I wasn't referring to the Abrahamic God) can blind a person to the flaws in their argument. You're stating that a god (which most people say is perfect) created the universe (perfectly). You're arrogant enough to assume that this universe was created for humans, one of the stupidest assertions you can make. If a god exists, he's a damn shitty one for creating all this useless crap around us (the whole universe that we don't really need). Why wouldn't a god give us better, longer lasting, stronger bodies? Why wouldn't a god make the universe centered around us if we were what he created it for? Why wouldn't we be living in a metaphorical ""Garden of Eden""? Here's the answer: because a god doesn't exist.Also, why do you assert that the christian God created the universe?"	AGAINST
498	god	"the ""grounding question"" only tries to play semantic word games - if someone asks why a god would allow 'evil' then they seize upon the word evil and say that for objective evil to exist means god has to exist. The argument is silly since using any word but 'objective evil' defeats it (pain, suffering, collectively agreed upon evil, etc.)Put 100 devout people in separate rooms and ask them 100 moral questions (e.g. if a pregnant woman has cancer, can she get chemotherapy to likely save her life if it would likely kill the baby?) - you will get many different answers and different justifications - so if there is objective morality, humans cannot converse with god and figure out what it is.We would still be left with subjective morality only we would be judged by a god who has an objective morality and sends people to the lake of fire based on a morality they can't know."

Everyone thinks of death, even atheists. It's not as if people who don't believe in an afterlife aren't aware that death is immanent.Everyone knows, old news at this point. Walking through a cemetery is nothing but a pretty picture and self-validation for those who have chosen to believe in a myth out of fear.I'm an atheist because 1. If there were a god it would be much more obvious. I mean... why the mystery? come on now, 82% of the world population believes in him in one form or another, you can't get that many humans to believe in anything. So what's with all the hiding? 2. It doesn't make sense. It makes far more sense from observation that humans are a happy mistake (for humans) and nothing more. All science shows pretty conclusively that life was inevitable on this planet, and likely many more considering the numbers involved. So no creator is necessary. 3. From my experience, religious people act as if they're the victims of some mass hysteria, therefore without further proof available, I must assume they are victims of some form of mass hysteria.

This is inconsistent with your definition. Despite my disbelief in Zeus, or more accurately, my unwillingness to change my behavior to reflect the validity of the assumption that Zeus exists, I still may believe in other deities. Also, you're assuming that every   religious   person approaches their own belief with a lack of skepticism, uncritically and wholly. This is simply untrue.

There is no way to explain the existence of everything in the universe without God or some sort of higher power.

Hence, it follows logically that God cannot create people with absolutely free will without the possibility that people might choose evil.  Secondly, you assume humans and God share the same definition of ""good.""You say that if a person is in poverty that is bad.  Yes and no.  It is true that they may lead an exceptionally painful existence, but God's measure of good is how many people accept him freely and enter heaven.

No. In fact, the very existence of so many views seems to make it more likely, more probable, and more believable that God exists. There are many different points of view on what government ought to be, but this observation does not mean that government doesn't exist. I agree completely with the observation, but that's all it is. It fails to function as an argument, and therefore cannot be valued as such in evaluatin the existence of God.

I write this specifically with Christianity in mind, but most religions give varying answers to the important questions of how we got here, why we are here, and what happens next. The concept of powerful supernatural being/beings is a very convenient way to allay all those curiosities and keep people from having to think too hard about them.So for me, it makes sense that the invention of God/gods is just a defense mechanism against confusion and spiritual crises.

No dumb dumb, our country was founded on religious freedom, not religion. Most of our forefathers were Deist, which means: ""The belief, based solely on reason, in a God who created the universe and then abandoned it, assuming no control over life, exerting no influence on natural phenomena, and giving no supernatural revelation.""You bible thumpers just decided to high-jack the whole thing. ""In God We Trust"" wasn't printed on money until 1957... 1957! for crying out loud!

Jefferson wrote his own version of the New Testament omitting all of the Jesus stuff. Regardless of what you happen to believe, arguing our country was founded on religion is revisionist at best, and quite against the spirit of the Constitution.It's not just by coincidence that we have become the most powerful nation on every level in the shortest amount of time in history.Again, this religious revision of our past is a recent phenomenon, and we were doing quite well before you annoying drones begin shoving it down everyone's throat. I mean, name one ""religious"" state that isn't a third world country. Every successful nation in history has separated church and State, including ours.

All I have to say is think of a places in the world where there is no God and you will only see death, poverty and despair. The evolution is a farce. Do you remember the cover of national geographic when they had a ape like skull saying that they have found the missing link. Of course that was found out to be a fraud. Point I'm making is, all you have to do is look around and look at the perfect order of nature the extreme complexity and to not even think that there is a creator designer behind it that it is just a mere coincidence. It's just stupid to think that all you are is just a piece of walking flesh do to the fact that evolution is the only reason you are here. And that all of nature with it's perfect order is because. Just look up the number of charities and the number is overwhelmingly Christian based probably the number would be actually more because a lot of them are but are afraid of persecution from Church and State laws.You have denial issues I think deep down you really feel that all of these things are possible but you have chosen to block it out and harden yourself for the truth.You know what makes me laugh is that you have Agnostic historians looking in the bible for references to help them find ancient cities and places. Take Troy for example just to name one out the dozens. They thought it was a myth until they discovered it referenced passages out of the bible to help them. Dude totally have taken the whole 9/11 thing to far. Pretty insulting of course I don't believe those you said.

There is a whole debate on that alone. There are numerous scientist that believe in intelligent design and go as far as Micro evolution which I believe in and is in-line with creation. Macro evolution where a Giraffe one day came from the see is as unlikely as you or I beating Tiger Woods in a golf match. Not going to happen. God says that we are created in is own image which is why our minds are godlike. If evolution is true than there would be more species with our capability to think and to rationalize. This fact alone baffles many evolutionary theorist for they don't have an answer for. So they do what Darwin did just make stuff up and throw clay at a human skull to fill the gaps.	FAVOR

550	god	"I categorically disagree with the definition of God provided here because while trying to provide a definition that will encompass all religions, it denies multiple beliefs. Many religions believe, as did Plato about his ""God of the forms,"" that God does not make the laws that rule the universe, but rules by the transcendent laws that are already in place. This being said, a multiplicity of religions believe that God did not create the universe's matter and energy, and nor does he have the power to do so. Also the argument of providing a definition of God to disprove denies one of the fundamental basics of argumentation- in order to disprove anything, you must disprove it within its own framework. For example, to disprove zuess you cannot make up your own definition. It is the same with God. The ontological argument would therefore assert that God must exist universally, because in order for the atheist to disprove God, they have to first accept the definition- which is that he exists"	FAVOR

If tomorrow god came and took all the Christians I'd be super glad because you guys are annoying. That aside though, there's no such thing so unfortunately it's not going to happen. If it did though, everyone would get along just fine. I mean, you people didn't even start showing up on this planet until 300 years after that guy Jesus (who may have never even existed) died, and everything was just peachy without you.3. Yeah, god is a private thing, and you have the right to believe in god or the easter bunny or big foot or whatever the hell you want. Problem is, Christians don't want religious freedom you nuts want everyone to believe your own insanity. But nope, sorry, the constitution is clear. Church and State are separate, and god should not be in public schools in any form whatsoever. Start your own school if you don't like it, but don't try to put it on everyone else.3. So when something bad happens like 9/11 we all of a sudden ask God why did he remove his protection. Total HypocrisyYou dumbass. 9/11 had nothing to do with ""god's protection""it was terrorists.God has never stopped a single tragedy in the history of the world, and he's not about to start just because you force your silly beliefs on other people.And your insinuation that somehow people die because of what they believe is not only incredibly stupid.

554	god	Atheism is the lack of beliefAtheism is the lack of belief in the   existence   of gods. It is not a belief system or a   religion   but the denial that supernatural beings exist. There are atheists with all sorts of philosophies and beliefs.YouÕre already an   atheist  Even if you believe in a god, you probably donÕt believe in other gods - Zeus, Osiris, Jupiter, Thor, Allah or Jesus. ItÕs hypocritical to be skeptical in the holy book, revealed prophets, miracle stories, or holy men of all religions but yours. You are an atheist when it comes to everyone elseÕs gods, so why give your god a free pass?The burden of proof is on the theistCan you prove that an invisible pink elephant is not floating above your head? How does one prove a negative in the absence of evidence? Theists make the exceptional claim that there is a god. That claim requires exceptional proof. The burden of proof is on the theist to prove God exists.By using reason and   science  , humans have been expanding our knowledge of the world. Yet religionists continue to claim that there exists a supernatural realm immune to reason. Where is their proof? If a god is needed to create the universe, what created God? Rather than offer proof, mystics have often tried to silence and discredit those who reveal the complexity and majesty of the universe.There are natural explanations for the universeWhat keeps flowers from turning into rocks, or rocks from floating in the sky? ItÕs not the will of a supernatural deity, but the fact that flowers are not rocks, and gravity keeps things on the ground. The universe operates according to causal principles, without the need for any supernatural   power   to keep things from getting chaotic.Morality does not require religionReligious texts can offer moral guidance, but they are not the source of moral principles. Humans discovered long ago that following certain rules makes life more productive, peaceful, and pleasurable. Morality derives from human nature, not divine guidance. If one wishes to live a virtuous life, it is better to do so because of the earthly rewards of being virtuous rather than the fear of eternal punishment. Unlike a theist, an atheist knows that one life is all he has, and will try to live each day to the fullest.	AGAINST

558	god	"Zebrakin appears to be a believer and that no amount of reasoned argument will change his mind.However, in the event that I'm wrong and that I can change his mind, I point out that it is a mistake to consider being convinced of something is the same as believing something.  The concept conviction is an intellectual conclusion based usually on a lengthy examination of the facts of reality. The concept belief is an abandonment of the intellect and an acceptance of what others have asserted without evidence or proof. Belief is ultimately based on wishes, and requires self-abnegation. Conviction is based on logic and requires self-assertion. Zebrakin states that I consider belief ""pathetic foolishness.""  Okay, but not accurate. In this day and age, I consider religious belief to be the most lethal form of brute force that men have invented. It stunts one's consciousness and tears it in two, attributing one's best to the non-existent and requiring one regard oneself as sacrificial fodder for the benefit of others. It is a boon to man's rational faculty that he can marvel at the beauty of the universe. But that is not ""in born."" Such an estimate arises from a fundamental regard of nature as benevolent and of man as heroic. That this is true is shown by the fact that many men do not regard the universe with wonder, nor look upon man as basically good. Instead they regard nature as a threat and man as basically evil. The better philosophers, such as Aristotle and Ayn Rand, have answered the questions you raise. (""to discover where [men] have come from, where they go to, and why they are here."") Many scientists, such as archeologists and physicists, have helped by adding factual details.  I sense in your closing statement a melancholy I should like to tell you is not necessary to feel. You wrote: ""Perhaps we feel we have to find answers to these questions because somewhere we know that there's more to this life."" A proper moral code, found in Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, shows that one need not wish that life is somehow better beyond the grave where men will find true happiness. One can find true happiness here on earth while we live. But to do so requires courage to face the reality that you have far greater intellectual strength than your religion tells you, far greater wealth of spirit that your beliefs suggest you possess, and that you are far superior in value to those you are taught to sacrifice yourself for. You can find happiness now by rejecting the moral code of your religion and discovering the rational moral code of Objectivism, which briefly put says your life belongs to you and the good is to live it rationally. May I suggest you read Ayn Rand's novels?---Especially Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead. In addition to being wonderfully original stories, they will help you to re-discover what your religion may have caused you to loose."	AGAINST

560	god	"Absence of proof, true, is not proof of absence, however, the absence of proof to support one's extraordinary claims is proof that one hasn't done one's factual homework nor does one appear to be interested in consistently logical reasoning.As I've said many times before in debates such as this, one need not disprove any so-called ""god"" or ""goddess"" or other claimed related entity. One cannot prove a negative, i.e. non-existence, because one cannot possess all there is to know everywhere and for all of time. What one can do and must do is check the facts and logic of those claiming the existence of such assumed entities. If their facts are incorrect, incomplete or inconsistent and if their logic is poor, one can in the least show the claimants arguments do not support their claims. One can show that the claimant has only very poor to no reason to believe what they do. One need only prove that the claimant has proven nothing at all.Absence of proof is proof the claimant's arguments - from beginning to their conclusions - are wrong. It makes no statement about the unknown or unknowable."	AGAINST
561	god	"Well, I've been debating theists quite aggressively for a few days now on this site, and frankly I'm a little worn out from it. You need to try to understand, that you are looking at the world from a completely different perspective than I am. I know, because I was very religious until my early twenties, it's 2 completely separate mindsets, and it's almost like two different languages one trying to communicate with the other, but I will go through your objections from my point of view the best I can.1. I believe one can account for their perspective on good and evil in humans. We are a pack animal, always have been. Even dog's, with 0 knowledge of any religion, know to protect and ""be kind"" to others in their pack, including their owner whom they see as the pack leader. In the same way, we as humans I believe naturally act in a manner which serves the ""pack"" even often at expense to ourselves. Those who remain within this norm of pack behaviour we call ""good"" those without we call ""evil"".Being brighter and more complex than dogs or any other pack animal, of course this instinct within ourselves becomes complex. But natural and observable none the less with or without any type of creator.2. True, if there was a creator, it would make sense to find our purpose of creation, even if our purpose for being created was strictly for his amusement. But I don't believe in intelligent design either, so not sure how that pertains to my arguement.3. Again, justice is established using our general and natural idea of empathy. And as we see this is not a constant, but shifts with time as we evolve. Empathy is a very natural instinct most humans are born with, which has developed because it does serve for the greater good of humans, even in the circumstance that it should not be in one instance or another the greater good for oneself.This is from us (again) being a pack animal. I think you'll find that if you take away our big brains, we really are a pathetic and week creature compared to most mamals.Minus our big brain, without the abilty to work together as a whole, and this means establishing rules and a sense of justice, we would be quite extinct right now, having all been eaten by lions and tiger and bears oh my.4. I would argue no one ""grounds it"", even the religious. What difference does it make what one's morals are grounded in if they have them none the less? The only relevent point is that a god is unnecessary for one to have a reason to live or a moral compass to live by. I never said the religious don't feel their morals are grounded, I simply offer myself as proof that the idea many of the religious have, that life without a god is somehow empty, is quite incorrect.5. mass murder read it, tons of examples. Just as many examples of the religious killing as of the non-religious killing. There is no proof to back up the idea that a person who doesn't believe in a god is more or less likely to kill, than one who believes in a god, and somehow twists it so that their god encourages the act of killing. Your arguement holds no water.6. I don't see what you're refering to, if you are numbering this according to my highlighted points, there is no evidence either way, and that's my point. There's a lack of evidence here.7. But this is the point. Your original arguement puts forth that, the religious are more moral because they have specifically religion to guide them. My point is again, while religion guides the vast majority of the human population (82% apx) those not guided by a religion are just as likely to be ""good"" or ""evil"" which would appear to make the belief in a god unnecessary in order to be ""moral""8. lol, this was hard to read. I'm not impressed by pretty words when discussing theology. I'm not swayed by mindless examples. My belief is one caught in a rip-tide is just as likely to drown whether they believe in god or not. You seem to be under the impression that there is something in life to be saved from. I do not see it this way. This is what I'm talking about when I say that it's like two people trying to communicate in two different languages. You do not seem to understand that I do not believe there is anything to be saved from in the general sense, and in the literal sense, I've never seen or heard of god saving anyone whose life was in mortal danger. Some live, some die, belief in god does not change these odds at all. The religious listen to example after example of people saying ""I was saved"" it's indoctrinated into the fiber of your being. From the outside, it looks like silly people looking for an easy way out. No one is saved, because there is nothing to be saved from. We live, we die, we make what we make out of it in the time in between. God plays no role. Some choose to believe in a god, but those who do not are just as happy, and quite often more so, than those who do. And in the end, whether someone believes in a god or not, they die and it's lights out. I don't think a religious person will ""live forever"" any more than I believe I will ""live forever"". What one believes is irrelevant ultimately outside of what they do with it here on earth while alive.Now, the religious can hardly (if at all) wrap their heads around the concept of simply being dead. It's like they have to believe there is an after-life, and by default, have to believe that everyone else must on some level at least want to believe there is an afterlife.I assure you, I do not on any level believe in an afterlife. I do not want to on any level trick myself into believing in an afterlife. I believe it is self-destructive to fool oneself in such a way.9. You have some typos that make this hard to understand. I think what your saying is that my account of how religion started is off,in which case the point flew clear over you, which it always does when I get into these discussions.Again, it's nearly impossible to explain to one such as yourself.But I'm not trying to explain exactly how religion began.I was simply giving an alternative example in order to point out my opinion thatreligion is quite unnecessary. That is what th point was.There is no point in me trying to guess how it all started (though I imagine it was from an inherent need within born of self-realization to not cease to exist at some point, which is not even the theory I put forth, but there you go)As I was saying, there is no point for me trying to guess though how it all started, and I don't care how or why it all started.My only point is that it is unnecessary."

Maybe historically it has been erratically believed that we need some sort of mythical creature in order to be ""good"".

If God created the universe, then where does he keep it?     If God is good, all powerfull, and all knowing, yet evil exists.  That proves that he either doesn not exist, or that he is not good, all knowing and all powerful, and therefore NOT devine.    We are made in his image, yet we are imperfect.  Therefore, God is imperfect and therefore NOT devine.     All of the   religious   texts were created by man, so using thems as proof is a fallacy.  It's not as if the good book magically appeared.  The STORY of the   ten commandments   is the only aspect that supposedly was drafted by God himself.  He exists because I read it in a book that some man wrote a long time ago.  Well there were a lot of books written a long time ago about the supposed ONE creator, and none of them are in agreement.  The fact that the three major religions all worship the same God comes from the fact that all three religions came from the same screwed up part of the world that still cannot abide by the   teaching   of peace found in all three religions.   How can you dismiss the many Gods of the Romans, Greeks, Pagans, American Indians, etc.  Why didn't God give these cultures the same teachings as the Middle East?  Their religions ceased not because they were wrong or disproven.

583	god	"You are obviously much more intellectually minded than I am at this point, but I relate that to years of life rather than my beliefs or views on religion and life. You say that there is a different in belief and conviction. Isn't it in true conviction that we find belief in something? Right now I sit in a chair, convinced it will hold me up. I've never studied a chair I don't know exactly why or how long chairs will hold people up, but I believe that I am safe. So I think that conviction and belief are closer and strongly related than you might suppose. If you go bungee jumping how do you know the cable will hold you up? They have broken before... Is this conviction? Or belief? Using what you stated as belief being a wish and conviction being logic, I would have to say that thinking it to be held would be both. You wish it to hold but you also know it will. ""[Religion] stunts one's consciousness and tears it in two, attributing one's best to the non-existent and requiring one regard oneself as sacrificial fodder for the benefit of others."" I must say, personally, that I do not regard myself as sacrificial fodder, but perhaps, you have the crusades or suicide bombers in mind? Both of these I don't defend as I can't possibly say they were ever justified in any ways.You speak about true happiness. ""One can find true happiness here on earth while we live."" What would you define as true happiness? Having lots of money? A pleasant relationship with your spouse? Having as your profession something you had always wanted to do, and that you love? I obviously don't have the answer, but perhaps you have some ideas? You must have been thinking of some things when you wrote it. Like I said, I don't have the answers (that's why I feel we have to look outside ourselves for them) but I think that as long as we strive to have true happiness for ourselves we shall never, ever be happy. ""You can find happiness now by rejecting the moral code of your religion and discovering the rational moral code of Objectivism, which briefly put says your life belongs to you and the good is to live it rationally."" Ah, so is this true happiness? You say to reject the moral code. For my religion (Christianity) that would mean rejecting love, obedience to authority,  unselfishness, etc. Good things in my opinion, and yours too I would think.  So forgive me if I cannot fully grasp your meaning. While were recommending books I would like to recommend Mere Christianity by CS Lewis. I found it rather intellectually stimulating and think you might too. If you do end up reading it, I hope you would with an open mind as I will when I read the books you suggested."	FAVOR

If the   atheists   are right, and I dont beleive they are, then I wonder if these songs would ever have been writen, I wonder if these men would have lost their minds without this hope, I wonder how many have been saved because these men dared to beleive in Gd?Amazing Grace by John Newton- Who was a murderous, drunken, immoral slave trader and captain of a slave ship. Who had been raised to know Gd but after his mothers death lost sight of Gd. His life is so wretched and brutal that not even his own crew liked him. And then one day he came across some literature on Jesus and remembered! A storm came up, like none hed ever seen before, and in the midst of that storm cried out to Gd and PTL Gd heard him!! He gave up slave trading and became a minister. Hallelujah!What a Friend we have in Jesus by a man from Ireland who later moved to Canada, named Joseph Scriven. Joseph lost his first bride the day before their wedding when she was drowned in a tragic accident. He lost his second wife to pneumonia. He devoted his whole life to being the good samaritan and doing good works for others, he never accepted   money   for his charity.Silent Night a Catholic priest in Austria named Joseph Mohr. His story is also quite moving.It is well with my soul by a man from Chicago Illinois named Horatio Gates Spafford. I saved this one for last because he is my favorite one! He lost his only   son   to a childhood disease. He lost his business real estates in the great Chicago fire. He was a friend to Moody and was going to England to help in the great revival happening in England but was called back at the last minute and his wife and four daughters went ahead. The boat was rammed by another boat and sank. He lost all four daughters in the   ocean  . His wife was rescued and sent him a telegram that said, SAVED ALONE. When he went to join her he penned this song on the boat trip there. This is why I know that Gd loves us even when   tragedy   strikes and we have a faith that no tragedy can take from us, the hope of glory, the hope of eternal life through the blood of the lamb Jesus.

Persecution of Christians prior to the conversion of Rome was occasional and local; the laws were directed primarily at clergymembers and at ""church property."" Extermination of non-Christians after the conversion of Rome, on the other hand, was a wholesale pogrom that lasted until Rome itself was no more.2) The original Sixth Commandment used a word for ""murder"" that only applied to the unjustified killing of Israelites. By definition, one could not ""murder"" a non-Israelite. So the commandment is more accurately translated as ""don't kill your own."" Had it been a blanket prohibition on killing, the Israelites would have been in violation of it quite routinely, as they attacked plenty of neighboring non-Jews.3) If ""true Christians"" never asked for anybody to be put to death, then by your own admission the entirety of your religion has been a big steaming pile o' horsehockey throughout its whole history, because Christians have been doing that since Christianity first appeared, and they still are.4) Not associating Catholics with Christians is looney-tunes. Catholics are the original, biggest, and most powerful Christian denomination. And the fact that ""one of the main reasons why pilgrims left England was because of their freedom of religion to not be persecuted by Catholics"" totally supports my point. Not only have the Christians been killing the non-Christians since time out of mind, but when they run out of non-Christians to kill they turn on each other. The Protestants and Catholics in England were equally brutal towards one another. Then the Protestants came to the Americas and massacred the native folks here. 5) You've reduced your position to ""Christian equals me, and anybody who thinks exactly like me."" Most self-defined ""Christians"" would not agree. You are not the authority on who is and isn't a ""Christian."" Hell, in my opinion, NONE of you are real ""Christians"" since you all blatantly ignore the teachings of Christ, who advocated giving up all worldly possessions and living an aesthetic lifestyle devoted to god.

645	god	"The basis of my argument is that God's word (whatever religion it is you are talking about) impedes our ability to reason about the consequences and impacts of our choices/actions. Any formalized set of rules does this when people are told to follow without questioning because something is supposed to be ""good"". Cases come up over and over again in everyday life, not just in difficult cases like abortion, euthanasia, cloning, where we confront the fact that reality is NOT black and white. But god's word and formalized rules want to simplify reality for us and this is where they fail. You should watch this ted talk about the ability to solve problems v.s. the ability to follow rules. Claiming to ""know the answer"" is the characteristic of zealous religious people, who believe that a rule given by god is THE only answer. The scientific reasoning is precisely to question those things that may seem as ""absolutes"". Regarding knowledge or education it would be absurd to say that we now know less things about the world than we did in the past. So, in the past - in the midst of more ignorance, it made sense to believe that if you don't worship a certain way god will get angry and stop the rain and your crops will die; but now, such a simple minded reason behind the need to behave well would not be accepted as we know more about how the world works. In this sense, we have more information needed to make decisions. I don't think it is necessary to think about difficult or modern day examples (cloning, abortion, euthanasia) and figure out how to apply religion to it. In every day decisions we are always forced to ""bend"" the words in the book because they can't provide answers. Then people argue that it is their own ""personal"" relationship to god what matters -- it would seem as if everyone has a different conception of God anyway, these words are then subjective and left to interpretation. No one is adhering to the words strictly because the words are too narrow. The world is not black and white. Teaching ethics and moral behavior requires a lot more than making people behave like sheep."	AGAINST
646	god	How can u critizes people who take scientific proof and reason to why the world was created. Religion is ignorant. If a super natural being created the universe than how was he (God) created. Even the big bang theory gives more rational evidence than the bible. Earth being created and sustaining water and land, creating a moon, and such all have factual evidence in HOW it was done. And yes the human race has been striving to X out god, and they have been succesful. They've X'ed out many things that the church once believed. It is only a matter of time till there is nothing more to X out. Then we will see who is ignorant. I wish this so called creator, instead of hiding, would step out and show him self. 	AGAINST

And I hope beyond hope that they will shed their mental shackles and one day breathe the air of freedom and truth. To each our own :)You sound like a standard evangelical Christian, and you just say how much God loves us and how he is wonderful and amazing and all that jazz. I mean, you ignore the fact that your bible is almost completely rewritten by corrupt Catholics in the dark ages, and that every scroll found of the traditional bible is highly contradictory, and none even mentioning the resurrection. (Yes, nothing pre-Catholic mentions your 'savior'). But you've completely ignored the fact that people create gods. If you can understand why you so easily dismiss those 1,000 other gods, perhaps you can understand why I dismiss the 1001. God is not a prerequisite for love. God does not love. At best, he is indifferent. I think it's very righteous of you to think he loves you. Do you presume that he loves the millions of children that starve to death? Does he love the millions that die of cancer, and other diseases that 'he' created? No 'loving' god would create literally thousands of horrific painful deaths. He obviously hand created cancer. Himself. Every part of it. Science believes cancer is a flaw in our evolution, just how we are. But god is flawless, therefore we should be 'flawless' as his creation. So, you believe that every horrific disease and death is an example of how wonderful and loving this 'god' is? Honestly that's kind of sick. If there's a 'he', he can't love us. You would never do what he 'does' to those you love. Earthquakes and volcanoes and the flu. This world sucks, honestly."	AGAINST

651	god	"Your reasoning is nonsense and has no sound justification.What William Carroll reminds us , ÒSt. Thomas Aquinas developed an analysis of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo that remains one of the enduring accomplishments of Western culture. The key to Aquinas' analysis is the distinction he draws between creation and change. The natural sciences, whether Aristotelian or those of our own day, have as their subject the world of changing things: from sub-atomic particles to acorns to galaxies. Whenever there is a change there must be something that changes. The Greeks are right: from nothing, nothing comes; that is, if the verb ""to come"" means a change. All change requires an underlying material reality.Creation, on the other hand, is the radical causing of the whole existence of whatever exists. To cause completely something to exist is not to produce a change in something, is not to work on or with some already existing material. If, in producing something new, an agent were to use something already existing, the agent would not by itself be the complete cause of the new thing. But such a complete causing is precisely what creation is. To create is to give existence, and all things are totally dependent upon God for the very fact that they are. God does not take nothing and make something out of ""it."" Rather, anything left entirely to itself, separated from the cause of its existence, would be absolutely nothing. Creation is not some distant event; it is the continuing, complete causing of the existence of everything that is. Creation, thus, is a subject for metaphysics and theology, not for the natural sciences.What is essential to Christian faith, according to Aquinas, is the ""fact of creation,"" not the manner or mode of the formation of the world. Aquinas' firm adherence to the truth of Scripture without falling into the trap of literalistic readings of the text offers valuable correction for exegesis of the Bible which concludes that one must choose between the literal interpretation of the Bible and modern science. For Aquinas, the literal meaning of the Bible is what God, its author, intends the words to mean. The literal sense of the text includes metaphors, similes, and other figures of speech useful to accommodate the truth of the Bible to the understanding of its readers. For example, when one reads in the Bible that God stretches out His hand, one ought not think that God has a hand. The literal meaning of such passages concerns God's power, not His anatomy. Nor ought one think that the six days at the beginning of Genesis literally refer to God's acting in time, for God's creative act is instantaneous.ÓRecent speculations that the universe began as ""quantum tunneling from nothing"" reaffirm the ancient Greek principle that you cannot get something from nothing. For the ""vacuum"" of modern particle physics, whose ""fluctuation"" some see as bringing our universe into existence, is not absolutely nothing. It is not anything like our present universe, but it still is something. Or else, how could it fluctuate?  Even if the universe were the result of the fluctuation of a primal vacuum, it would not be a self-creating universe. The need to explain the existence of things does not disappear.So to say that matter cannot be created or destroyed just indicates its within a closed system and has no bearing on whether God brought it into existence or not.

I'm not saying that the that the people that are dying in Africa deserve to die to to genocide or starvation or anything else.

655	god	"I'm afraid ""conventional wisdom"" isn't a very firm basis on which to rest an argument. ""Conventional wisdom"" has held a lot of things which turned out to be wrong. Moreover, it is not clear that the conventional wisdom cited here is in fact universal to the human species (and even if it were, so what? Humankind can't be wrong?). I would suspect that this is a cultural, not a species, assumption. An idea, for example, which had been dominant in the West was that of the great chain of being, where all things were connected in this chain, and related things looked like one another. Thus, in the Renaissance walnuts were thought to be good for treating problems with the brain because they resembled human brains. An even bigger objection is that the claim that things tend to ""reflect"" their source seems to be inaccurate. It is also a vague phrase that can probably be shifted in ways that make it impossible to disprove, but let's leave that aside. The examples given here really stack the deck. For any one exmaple of how a thing looks like its source, I could likely give 10 examples of things that do not. Knowledge looks nothing like the books from which it was obtained; books look nothing like trees; trees look nothing like acorns; acorns, in turn, look nothing like trees, nor like sunlight, water, or nutrients. I shouldn't have to belabor the obvious here - claiming that things resemble their sources is such a vague claim that it is largely meaningless, and if the claim is made more specific, it becomes less apparent that this is something we should assume, ""conventional wisdom"" or not. Without this very problematic assumption, there is no argument. The American atheists must really be slacking off if they haven't registered an objection to this ""argument"" yet."	AGAINST

But the further one falls toward either end of the spectrum, the less choice is involved.  I think this is one of the difficulties gay people face in society.  There are a significant number of people, both in straight and gay relationships, who honestly recognize that they DID have a choice -- they COULD have fallen in love with someone of either gender.  These people are bisexual, even if they do not personally identify as such.  And many of them, both gay- and straight-identifying, generalize their experience to the rest of the population and assume that, because THEY had a choice, EVERYONE ELSE must also have had the same choice, must have the same feelings they experience.  This presents a problem for the people at the far-end of the gay side of the spectrum.  People at the ""straight"" end are not hurt by the issue of ""choice"" -- they have society's official okey-dokey and often simply assume that people in same-gender relationships are just ""perverse"" and have decided for some inexplicable reason to do something that the straight-end folks cannot imagine doing.The people more towards the middle just assume that everyone had they same choice they did, and that therefore, they should simply accept the ""consequences"" of that ""choice.""The people at the far-end on the homosexual side, however, know that they didn't have a choice.  Nobody ever gave them a choice.  They've been this way for as long as they can remember, and yet they have all the other people pointing a finger at them and telling them they MUST have chosen to be this way.  Of COURSE they must have.I said somewhere else that it is very much like the story of the blind men and the elephant.  Each of us finds ourselves touching the elephant's trunk or leg or flank or tail, and assumes that everyone else MUST be sharing the same experience.Not true.

679	gayRights	"----------------------------Leviticus----------------------------Leviticus is commonly misinterpreted to refer to homosexuals with the following 2 verses:Leviticus 18:22: ""You shall not lie with a male as those who lie with a female; it is an abomination."" Leviticus 20:13: ""If a man lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination and they shall surely be put to death."" These verses have nothing to do with   homosexuality   when you look at the rest of Leviticus and other passages. Both of these verses refer to heterosexuals who participated in fertility rituals in order to guarantee good crops and healthy flocks, not homosexuals, there is absolutely no mention of sexual orientation or homosexuality. Also, the word abomination was used for anything that was considered to be religiously unclean or dealing with any type idol worship.The Hebrew word ""toevah"" was used in Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13. ""Toevah"" has been translated in our Bibles as ""abomination"" or ""detestable"". The ""toevah"" was used throughout the Old Testament for activity involving ethnic contamination and   religious   idolatry. ""Toevah"" refers to things that were ritually unclean - like eating pork. It is significant that another Hebrew word, ""zimah,"" also translated ""abomination,"" which means intrinsic evil or evil by its very nature, was not used in Leviticus 18:22, or Leviticus 20:13.Notice that Lev. 18:2 deals with idolatry. In fact many of the prohibitions in the Holiness Code were connected with idolatrous practices, see 19:26-29.--------------------------------Romans--------------------------------This is another passage commonly taken out of context. Romans was not talking about homosexuality, it was referring to idolatrous practices and other sins. Letters from the Apostle Paul Romans 1:26-27If taken out of context, this passage seems to condemn homosexuals. However, when Romans 1:26-27 is considered within the context of Romans 1:16 through Romans 2:16, the Scriptures clearly present a different   teaching  . Paul was writing to the   church   in Rome. The Roman church had become troubled by divisions related to   spiritual   pride. Paul was addressing the Christians in Rome and teaching about the pagans in Rome. After declaring the   power   of Christ's gospel to save all, he pointed out that the religious people of Rome had refused to even acknowledge GOD as one of their many gods. They had turned their backs on the one true living God and worshiped handmade idols. Paul explained that as a result of their idolatry, every part of their lives had become corrupt and vile. Paul then told the Roman Christians that they were not to judge others. To judge others is to condemn yourself (Romans 2:1). Christians are to love others out of their brokenness and into the   healing   wholeness that is found in Jesus Christ. The Greek word Paul used, that has been translated in our Bibles as ""natural/unnatural"", relates to that which is against one's own inherent nature (i.e., heterosexuals engaging in   homosexual   acts). It was also related to Paul's concept of what was culturally acceptable. The same Greek word is used in I Cor. 11:14-15 in reference to correct hair length for men and women and in Gal. 2:15 in reference to Jews and Gentiles who were such by ""nature."" Paul emphasized that IDOLATRY (not homosexuality) was the evil which resulted in temple prostitution, sadomasochism, and lack of regard for others. "	FAVOR
680	gayRights	"""Rational moral truth is based on the observation that people are all basically the same, that they have the same fundamental physical, psychological, and spiritual needs (by ""spiritual"" I do NOT mean, religious or supernatural. I merely mean needs that are not physical).""This understanding of human sameness or shared anthropology is incomplete precisely because you leave out the actual spiritual element of man yet give the illusion that it is included.  The idea that all people are basically the same, i.e.. created equal (again something only guaranteed  by God), is a Biblical idea.  One could suppose that in a modern rationalistic society why would we put so much stock in a principle from a ""dusty old book?""  Perhaps because this dusty old book is right.  You include the physical, biological or bodily part of man (Gk. Soma) and the psychological part (Gk.psyche), but by defining spiritual by something that it is not you actually fail to give an adequate definition which is to state which that thing is.  Equating spiritual needs to ""merely...needs that are not physical"" fails to distinguish between what is actually a spiritual need and what could also be a emotional need or a psychological need which can also not be considered physical in the biological sense.  The implication of this vaguely communicated idea of spiritual need actually leaves out the real essence of spiritual need.  This is necessary to fit the paradigm of ""live and let live"" because such a structure of apparent moral law fails to account for the totality of the human experience not just in the individual human experience but in the communal as well.  It is incapable of doing so because the motive is not the ultimate concern for the common good but an excuse of the individual to unconcern them self with the good of the other.  As the concept ""live and let live"" is shaped by the humanistic framework of individuals operating as laws unto themselves, it fails.  When, as was originally meant in the phrase ""live and let live,"" it is to literally do unto others as you would have them do unto you there is a change for hope.  Here the common good and the good of the neighbor is established.  It is not about how little should be done (tolerate, mind your own business about the life of others) but what should be done (how can I love my neighbor in this circumstance, what does it mean to love my neighbor?).  This is the a central teaching of Jesus Christ and of Christianity.  The modern   evolution   of the idiom however, has scarce remembrances of this original meaning and fails precisely because, again, it does not take into account the breadth of human experience both individually and communally (and is unequipped to address the full experience because its own ethos makes such parts and judgments of others off limits) and has no concern for the common good (because likewise the good cannot be established because the ethos of the modern ""live and let live"" make such judgments impossible).  I should clarify by judgments I don't intend to imply being judgmental  but rather only the ability to judge whether the actions, motives and intentions of the other are morally right or wrong according to the Good.  Compare:""Live and let live, i.e. Do as you would be done by...""-1678, English Proverbs""Live and let live is a pretty good philosophy. If the guy in the next lane isn't buckled up, why not leave him alone?"" (2001, Washington Times)Both quotes acquired from the The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs.[See also my other post, ""Christ...fully reveals man to himself.""]Secondly, you further beg the question, i.e. provide a circular argument, by stating that live and let live is good because watching people live and let live (without the ability to harm others) is good because you have observed it so.  You then conclude, therefore, that homosexuality is not morally wrong.  This is Non Sequitur; where the logic of your agrument does not follow from the premise to the conclusion offered.

688	gayRights	"I've been reading the opposite side with a lot of interest and just like I expected, people have brought in a whole array of ""issues"" they have about homosexuality.First I read about how the motives of the gay person are selfishMy response: WHO CARES? I see an old lady crossing the street. I help her cross over. Did I do it because I truly cared for her or did I do cause I wanted to feel good about myself? Does it matter? As long as I didn't help her because I wanted to steal her purse in the process then where is the harm???? So what if gays want to satisfy their parental instincts by caring for a child? How does that undermine the care and the love? Don't straight couples do the same? How many times have I heard straight couples saying that they will have children because that ""completes the family"", that they can't wait to be great mums or great dads. That's selfish too isn't it? But is it wrong? Hell no! I would be worried of someone didn't have that streak of selfishness in them. In my opinion, the people that make the best parents are the ones that wanted to be parents in the first place. Not just procreate, but BE PARENTS afterward. Here we have people that are begging to be parents and we're telling them ""you can't! we'd rather leave the kids in the orphanage than give them to you!""Then it's about how it is unnatural for them to become parents because by definition they would be required to do something that is unnatural for them Right, so, should we exclude all infertile individuals from the right to adopt?Because the above argument basically implies that inability to conceive/procreate equals inability to perform as a parent, because nature didn't want you to become one in the first place. Isn't that ridiculous? The fact that we have children in foster care proves that the ability to conceive/procreate does not equal the ability to become a parent. So the two are clearly not cross linked.Then it's about how it is no one's right to adopt because the only person that has authority over a child is the biological parent - only they can ""appoint"" someone to look after their childSomeone actually used the word ""property"", the child is the property of the biological parents and no institution should ever have the right bypass them and give the child to someone else. Since when are human beings ""property""?As a parent, all you have, is the responsibility to raise the child and provide for it. That's all you have. You don't posses a child. No one has possession of another human being, however young. Now, I know for a fact that adoption agencies always look for people in the immediate or larger family that would foster the child. It's only when they have exhausted all those possibilities that the child is put up for adoption. In other words, no one in the family has offered to take over the responsibility! So it is then in the hands of the agency to find suitable parents from the general public. Let's be realistic, the family has absolved itself, or is not existent, or is mentally incapable. Now, I'm not saying everybody else then has the right to be their parent. But I think they do have the right to at least apply for the role, whether gay or straight. But the child is going to be bullied!Well, is that really an argument? If the kid is going to be bullied that's because the parents of the other children are bigoted and they have instilled that bigotry on their bully-kid. Kids are bullied everyday for being black, Muslim, Asian, tall, short, ginger etc etc. Does that mean we should take them away from their black, Muslim or ginger parents? The reality is, these kids are spending their life in an orphanage. I find it funny how people who are otherwise unwilling to adopt them, think that they have the right to obstruct others who do. And they justify it with an array of bigoted crap. And all this time, those kids remain in the orphanage, when they could be in the hands of very loving, very caring, very responsible people who could give them a much better life, a much better education and much more to experience."

707	gayRights	Brilliant clip.I did not know that relatives of homosexuals tend to have more kids (the male ones at least.)But is that based on observation only?I'm confused why that would be true. Did you find anything that offered a genetic or social reason?It's seems the number of kids one has would have more to do with how many times they have sex without a condom, more than anything.What about having a gay relative would make one more likely to participate in unprotected sex more often? If it's a simple fertility issue... again I'm flabergasted. That would suggest that the ability of one to have kids is reversely proportional to their genetic propensity to only have gay sex...I just had a thought.Following that the relatives of gays have more kids,it would stand to reason that that is the reason why, while gays themselves tend not to pass on their genes, the percent of gays stays static.So then, things like viagra, and fertility clinics would essentially lower the percentage of people who are gay.This assuming1. relatives of gays have historically and presently been less likely to need outside help reproducing.2. those who historically had more trouble having kids did not have any gay relatives, thus perhaps slightly less likely to have gay children, and now are able to have more kids, where in the past they could not.Not sure what my point is, but it interests me for some reason.

If he were just a careless deity that made people then left them with no clue as to who he was, and didn't care what they did, and wasn't interested in helping them, he would NOT be the God I love.

For instance... my husband could tell me that he loves me and will love me no matter what I do or don't do. Let's say upon hearing this I take his unconditional love and flaunt it by bringing home a different man every night to sleep in our bed, or I beat our   children  , or any other offensive act.

I have read the article on Romans and Shine Prostitution and found it to be well-argued.  Although, I am a little bothered by the use of the term anti-gay.  I have read portions of Gagnon's book and he, like yourself, struggled with this issue.  Early on in the book, he writes about his heartfelt struggle.  When someone argues that homosexual practice is a sin, this does not make them anti-homosexual, or anti-anything.  I have desperately struggled with this issue personally and for the sake of others.  I would never characterize myself as anti-gay.  As I grow closer to Jesus, I feel more and more his love for all people well up inside of me.  I wish the church as a whole weren't homophobic.  I wish I didn't have to hear people around me, most of whom are Christians, use ""gay"" and other words I won't mention, as derogatory comments.  (When I am feeling bold, I gently correct them.)  Sometimes I don't want to call myself a Christian because this associates me with some of the people who have incited hate-mongering against homosexuals.  My heart aches over this struggle because I have personally been affected by it and I have met many others who have felt these affects as well.In the sending of his only son, Jesus Christ, God offered all people a saving relationship with himself.  This is the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant:  ""I will bless you and make you a great nation and through you all people will be blessed"".  In this fulfillment, the people of God became all those who accepted, believed in, and followed the one whom God sent, Jesus Christ.  In the Mosaic or Sinai covenant, Israel was required to obey the Mosaic law in order to receive salvation.  But in Christ, the people of God, all people, Jew and Gentile, were freed from the law and now received salvation through the grace of Jesus Christ by faith.  So, to put it briefly, in Christ, God has removed the contractual obligation of the law and has offered a relationship.  This never ceases to amaze me!!  He wants to be in relationship with me!!

719	gayRights	No statement contained within any of my arguments asserts that homosexuals are biologically incapable of sexual reproduction; the terms of my arguments were carefully chosen so as to not exclude the ability of homosexuals to sexually reproduce. Yet, in order for them to sexually reproduce and propagate their genetics through a progeny they must act contrary to their nature and have unprotected sex with the opposite gender, and probably more than once.  Now, since they actually are biologically capable of becoming progenitors we must therefore conclude they are not willing to do what is necessary to become parents. They choose to do that which will never produce offspring and are suffering the consequences of their choices; moreover, if they donÕt like the consequences of their choices they ought to change their minds. Conclusion: Individuals of the homosexual orientation can become progenitors. Yet, they choose to not do what must be done in order to become progenitors.  And finally, no man or woman has the right to become a parent. Parenthood is not a right; parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction. And no man or woman can justly claim authority over the progeny of another progenitor without the progenitorÕs conference of authority over its progeny.	AGAINST

Because, if it is, you're fucking stupid.The issue in India has to do with gender inequality. Gay marriage would actually help the situation for two reasons:1) More homosexual couples would mean more children would be adopted.

It was called the way of ""Shudo"", or youth. But it also showed up quite a bit--In monasteries, especially, where heterosexual acts were forbidden or simply impossible. Male   prostitution   was incredibly common throughout Japan's history. All of these things were written about by Jesuits--If they're something that Priests are being shown, they have to be somewhat normal.Europe: From Greece till the 18th century,   homosexuality   was an incredibly common occurence. Greece I feel like I don't even need to discuss. Every emperor of Rome with the exception of Claudius took a male lover at some point. This kept up until Theodosius, in 390, made it illegal to play the receptive part, and Justinian, in 558, did the same with the active part. So, for the majority of the Roman empire, homosexuality was accepted and common. In fact, for a lot of the Greek and Roman histories, same-sex love was the epitome of what we would term as romantic or meaningful love. Heterosexual love was what you did for   children  . The poets, from Plato and Aristotle to Sappho, spoke at length about that idea. And it makes sense. Familiarity breeds affection, and these were incredibly gender-segregated societies. Women were consigned to the home--Although this meant they really ran a farm rather than dusted--while men were either at war for a decade and a half, or in town doing the   politics   of the day.Throughout the renaissance, it was once again quite common with such public figures as Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and several more artists openly taking male lovers.

747	gayRights	"Well spoken, yet I cannot agree with you. In your conclusion you state that there is an aspect of choice. There are a few ways I can interpret your second sentence. (in the conclusion) Here is mine, individuals of homosexual orientation can become progenitors by choice, but must do this by an act that goes against their sexual orientation. Thus, their sexual orientation is against that of a progenitor and since progenitors are what create life and that very creation of life is a consequence of sexual reproduction, parenthood is formed. Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in. Yes, parenthood is, in part, the result of progenitors, but it is also very much so the raising and the nurturing aspect as well. When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood. You state that parenthood is a consequence of sexual reproduction, which I do not disagree, but another aspect of parenthood is the raising and nurturing. Having the ability to raise or nurture or both does not have reference to sexual orientation. Since this is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent. Perhaps they aren't the progenitors, but are fully capable of parenting. Thus, any human can posses the abilities to parent. Because of this a homosexual couple can posses the abilities to parent and thus have a right to be offered the option of adoption."	FAVOR

No different then adultery, fornication, internet porn or premarital sex. Many who look at this argument are stressing a point of perception that the gay and lesbian community and those who support them are trying to incorporate into American culture. God's righteous doesn't change to meets today's modern opinions. He does not condemn the homosexual from eternal life through repentance just as he doesn't bar the theft or internet porn addict, so long as they repent. None of us are permitted a ""Mulligan"", a sin we are allowed to engage in that is shielded from which God asks us to repent.    The most difficult ideal for gay and lesbian Christians to accept is their active engagement in their lifestyle is asked by the Father to be left at the Cross. Many liberal Christians have developed a pick and chose mentality of Christian faith and it has led many astray. V. Gene Robinson is a classic example, how can one lead a flock while being actively engaged in his most deep rooted sin. It engulfs his entire flock, they thus become embroiled in the entire debate of sexual sin, instead of growing in Christ. Sadly this has shielded active sinners into a false sense of security as they believe they are right with God, when actually they are in bondage to the one thing they won't give to Him. I tell you would a homosexual say it is ok to strike a brother, NO. Would he allow a child to be sexually abused, NO.

Carefully note what Dr. Robert Gagnon says.ÒI do not doubt that the circles out of which Lev 18:22 was produced had in view homosexual cult prostitution, at least partly. Homosexual cult prostitution appears to have been the primary form in which homosexual intercourse was practiced in Israel."" - Gagnon, p. 130""There is good evidence of homosexual cult prostitution in Israel during the period of the divided monarchy.Ó p. 100.The [Hebrew] term [qedesim/qades] denotes Òmen at cult sites who engaged in homosexual prostitution: male temple (or cult, shrine, sacred) prostitutes.Ó p. 101.Qedesim Ò...one of whose cultic functions was to offer their bodies to other men for same-sex intercourse.Ó p. 102.Òtwo other occurances of qedesa in the Bible (Gen 38:21-22; Hos 4:14) also link it with the term zona, Òprostitute, harlot.Óp. 103. Homosexuality wrong?ÒThe remark in I Kgs 14:24 that the people of Judah Òconformed their behavior to all the abominations (toebot) of the nations which Yahweh dispossessedÓ sounds remarkably like the summary in Lev 18:24-30, which followed a listing of sexual offenses that singled out in particular same-sex male intercourse as an Òabomination.ÓÓ p. 103.Òthe same-sex role of the assinu, kugarru, and kuluu (who, owing to castration, were certainly unsuitable partners for heterosexual intercourse and impregnation) does provide good evidence for homosexual cult prostitution.Ó p. 104.ÒThe harsh descriptions of the qedesim in I-2 Kings (I Kgs 14:24: Òeven qades were in the landÓ) and Job 36:14, along with the epithet of ÒdogÓ in Deu 23:18, suggests a degree of revulsion more suited to same-sex male cult prostitution.Ó p. 104.ÒThat means JosiahÕs action against the qedesim in the temple precincts was likely taken as a direct result of laws in Deut 23:17-18 regarding the qedesim or Òdogs.ÓÓ p. 106.ÒIt can hardly be denied that... (the author of Job 36:14) regarded the qedesim as homosexual cult prostitutes.Ó p. 108.ÒCult association is established by the name Òholy/consecrated onesÓ and by the connection to Asherah. The element of prostitution is clear from Deut 23:17-18 (fees for services rendered) and the connection to qedesot, who elsewhere are identified as harlots.Ó p. 108. Homosexuality wrong?ÒThe same-sex dimension is suggested by the label Òdogs,Ó by history of religion parallels, and by the unlikelihood of male heterosexual prostitution.Ó p. 108.ÒThe existence of homosexual shrine prostitutes in Judah was a recurring problem.Ó Dr. Robert Gagnon, p. 110.""Its not gay people who are taking the Bible out of context.

761	gayRights	"As it happens, ""gay"" or ""homosexual"" define behavior, NOT one's genetic makeup. As science has discovered, generally, when you determine a specific gene to be responsible for one characteristic or another, turning that gene on or off will affect not simply the characteristic you were interested in but also characteristics you didn't anticipate. What this means is, there can be no ""gay gene"" however, there are likely at least one or more genes that set the stage for a predisposition for homosexual behavior. That one has the gene or genes in no way implies one MUST behave as a homosexual. But, of course, the same is true of heterosexuality. Certainly, nature establishes the necessary mechanisms for individuals to reproduce themselves, however, what nature does NOT do is establish one MUST reproduce. Clearly, an individual can choose not to reproduce and most individuals do in that most individuals engage in non-reproductive sex regardless of the gender of their partner. Also, nature clearly has no regard for whether you reproduce or not, i.e., there is no individual reproductive imperative in order for the individual to live, in that nature creates some individuals without a clear polarity to their gender and also creates individuals unable to reproduce but with the outward appearance of one gender or the other, and yet many of these individuals live full lives regardless of their inability to reproduce. ""Survival of the species"" appears to be a human invention and not a natural imperative. The rest of nature appears not to be concerned in the least whether humans continue to exist. That is the concern of individual human beings alone.You could just as easily say, ""science doesn't support the ""heterosexual gene"" either. Heterosexuality is a behavior which is clearly always choice because heterosexual CAN choose otherwise even if they generally do not. Also, reproduction isn't always nor even usually the reason for heterosexual behavior in that individuals commonly choose not to reproduce so, reproduction is also always choice - even if the choice is often made without regard for its consequences.Heterosexuality is no more an imperative than is homosexuality, bisexuality or asexuality. All of these behaviors are chosen but chosen loosely based on one's genetic predispositions, one's experiences and within one's current context."	FAVOR

Marriage is, in origin, a religious practice, and it should remain so without any legal connotations.My personal preference remains that the state should remove itself completely from the issue of marriage and all legal unions should be ""civil unions"". Then, every church may decide the capacity of its marriages, but the state would be free to place secular restrictions on civil unions. Thus, polygamist-religions can have their multiple-marriages, conservative christian groups can forbid gay-marriage, liberal-christian groups can allow gay marriage, and the legal benefits in all cases remain the same: none. Then, any two people who want the current legal benefits associated with marriage can file for a civil union in much the same way that they are currently required to file for a ""marriage license""."

I have, however, clarified to my earlier post, that when I forgot to specifically mention pedophilia as being unrelated to homosexuality, I assumed the reader would group pedophilia and serial murder. I have clarified this point, and I'll say again, pedophilia and serial killing are in no way similar to homosexuality. I was merely using hyperbole to show that people do not have a right to do everything they are born desiring.""whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is not a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact.""  a scholarly response to the idea that this has been pr oven. I'm sure we can both go on all day posting on this idea, the reality is we just don't know. I personally believe people are born with a predisposition toward homosexuality which can either be cultivated or repressed, but everyone has the ability to make decisions in their life. Besides, no one is arguing gays should stop what they're doing (well, some people probably are).Again, ad homonyms all over. It seems If anyone says something you disagree with the best thing to do is call them hateful and stupid. Oh and gay, but I guess I'm too dumb to get that.If 51% of people voted for slavery it wouldn't matter because slavery is made illegal by the constitution and the courts would then have an obligation to point that out. That's what it's for. If anyone can show me where it says you have a right to marry whomever you want in the constitution I will go picket in CA right now.I guess I should be more clear. Gay people have been persecuted for a long time. It's a shame they feel the need to persecute others now that they are gaining popularity. And you can call me a liar whenever you disagree with me if you like (it's very effective I'm sure), but my sister cried every day during the prop 8 thing because she supported it and she was constantly harassed. I never said she was afraid for her life, but that does make the story more interesting, doesn't it :)""You seem to think I live in some state of fear?""This was also irony. I was suggesting that discrimination against gays has largely disappeared (that doesn't mean everyone agrees with you, it just means their rights are no longer being violated, i.e. they can get work, they don't get killed (hopefully!), etc).

Do more research, my father is a leader in the Mormon church. While church members donated and were asked to support the legislature, the church itself did not make any political donations. I'm not as sure about the Catholics, but if they're smart they played it the same way. I agree that some of the churches which are heavily political (i.e. Jeremiah Wright?) should get out of politics or be taxed as political entities. Churches do, however, have a right to encourage voting on moral issues (it's actually in the law, believe it or not), and both of these churches are silent on political issues outside of this.I won't apologize for my opinion. The real irony is that I'm not even opposed to gay marriage. I'm opposed to people who will do anything to get their way, no matter who it hurts. Anyway, you've heard my point of view. I will change it the minute anyone can shows me that gay marriage is a protected constitutional right, or when a vote is passed. Until then, I respect your right to believe in whatever you want, and I even respect your right to hate and mock everyone who disagrees with you (thought I will then ask you to respect my right to call you a hateful shallow bigot. yay free speech).

776	gayRights	"Went I attended The Ohio State University it was going through a tranistion in it's Psychology department.  The 70's were a time of new ideas and conventions.Our Professors were being told to teach that homosexuality was not abnormal or a disorder.  But that didn't change the facts.In particular male homosexuality is still quite rare 1/2 to 1 % of the population is actively gay or homosexual.As for whether its is ""born"" or learned the answer lies somewhere inbetween.  Men and women are often born genetically inbetween male and female.  This is a known fact and in some cases infants even have both sets of genitalia.  Some men grow up with feminine behaviors, voices, and even build.This however doesn't predetermine their gender identity, because often parental and peer influence is so strong that these men fall into the role of the male parent and spouse. However, when young, they can be ostacized by alpha males, and drawn to homosexuals who might see them as an easy turn.Others are afffected by sexual trauma inflicted by a family member or peer, and othertimes imprinting behavior is missing in a family that is not functioning prooperly because of divorce or a parent accidentlly or deliberately confusing their role.  In affect, in both situations it is a learned behavior though in the latter case is dramatically affected by biologically conflicted gender identity.It is an unpopular stand to take to say that being gay is abnormal, but the fact that it is rare and is not selected for genetically and it can not reproduce itself genetically over time says that it is an abnomally.That said I believe that tolerance and love is called for, but not encouragement we are seeing in our society today.  We don't encourage deafness, blindness, or   autism  , though we also are not intolerant of their condition.  Then too we will strive to imprive their situation if a ""cure"" presents itself.

801	gayRights	"The specific thing you requested was for me to give you a legitimate reason why someone would oppose gay marriage for reasons other than religion. I did that. You said that, ""I feel that bigotry or ignorance are the only reasons to oppose this issue."" I thought I gave a perfect example where this was not the case. Some people just don't want to be around other people. That does not make them a bigot nor does it make them ignorant. Not granting gays the word marriage but granting them the same rights does not make one a bigot nor does it make one ignorant nor does it hurt the gay community.You say that same but separate is not good enough as though as soon gays are allowed to marry the bigots will suddenly see the errors of their ways. That's not going to happen. All the litigation in the world will never force a bigot to accept you. He will just look at you in the eye, turn around, and roll his eyes.My argument does not call people names. Your argument calls anyone opposed to gay marriage a bigot or ignorant. The side you're on is considered liberal. The side I'm on is seen as conservative. I don't categorize my argument as conservative because it takes a middle of the road approach. Take a little (your rights) give a little (leave the word behind). This is what I call negotiation. The side you're on is not interested in negotiation and is seen as militant; it's a ""my way or the highway"" approach and then your side acts surprised when they encounter resistance.The side your on wants people to put themselves in their shoes but they are not willing to put themselves in the shoes of the other side.The side I'm on is seen as being based on religion. I don't categorize my argument as being based on religion because my argument does not invoke religion. It invokes human nature. My argument is also constructive in that it alienates a smaller group on the religious right. It is pragmatic and rational in that it gets gays their rights sooner and all they are leaving on the table is just a word.People can want all they want. I never said it was unreasonable. I just think that it is not practical at this point in time as evidence by proposition 8. I have said that gays will eventually win. But why does it have to be right now and at what cost? Take your time, regroup, do a ""lessons learned"" analysis of what went wrong and why and then try again later.People can want all they want but that does not mean that they are entitled to it or that they deserve it or that they have a right to it.The status quo does not seem right to me. Otherwise I would never have suggested to bypass them. I saw an injustice occurring and I tried to think of a pragmatic approach towards getting what I consider important and leaving behind what I don't consider important in the shortest amount of time. That was my contribution. That was my way of stepping up to the plate and trying to fix things and I got slammed. This explains why others that have tried to help the gay community but encountered the negative feed back have stopped supporting gay marriage more than anything else. What allowed slavery to continue was not inaction and complacency. People were working towards fixing it. What allowed slavery to continue for as long as it did is that it takes time to change the world. The gay community is not asking for certain rights, it is demanding them. The gay community is not interested in negotiating and this stance is alienating a lot of potential allies. The gay community is taking an in your face approach and are surprised when the other side responds in kind.The group that followed Martin Luther King were not militant. The Black Panthers were.The gays that are peacefully trying to advance their agenda are not militant. The ones vandalizing churches are.The gay community wants to portray itself as being the new civil rights fighters of our generation. The black community finds this highly offensive. What is the worst a gay man has had to openly endure in the last 10 years and compare that to what a black man had to endure during the 60's. There's no comparison. The gay community as the new civil rights fighters of our generation is an exaggeration; it is a tactic meant to get them what they want, nothing else.No one promised gays the right to marriage. They can have their love legally recognized under a different name and not suffer because of it. They can be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness without the having the word marriage. The word marriage will not magically get them to be acceptance nor get them a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted. They have to find happiness within themselves. No one can grant it to them so no one can deny it to them.I hope you see why I am upset at those hypocritical gays that say ""empathize with our suffering in a society that does not fully accept us"" and then turn around and vandalize churches. Now that is a real crime and it is not very accepting of the other side. I don't think they are empathizing with the other side, do you? I guess they forgot to put on their neighbors shoes. Do you think that when gays call the other side hateful and bigot and ignorant that they are able to see the humanity of the other side? Does maligning someone help you solve your differences or does it hinder? And if it hinders, why do it. What value is there in calling someone a bigot? It is a great tactic. The Nazis used it with great success to get people to think that it was OK to kill Jews because, after all, Jews were vermin. You see?"	AGAINST
802	gayRights	"Because one cannot exist nor act ""outside of nature"", i.e., there being no ""outside"", all that one does is necessarily natural. Your argument is one of assumption that the purpose of a single human life and the purpose of ALL human life is procreation. Although true, the species will not continue without a sufficient number of individuals reproducing, you assume also that it is the duty of either every or at least some individuals to do so. I would submit there is no such duty to ""carry on the species"", however, one is certainly and ought certainly be free to do so if one wishes. What one is not free to do nor ought to be free to do is compel a false duty to reproduce on every individual member of the abstract idea of ""species"".I must also submit that the word and utterance ""marriage"" has many meanings depending on the one using it and context of its use. Individual human beings ""marry"" themselves to one another in an enormously diverse number of ways. Mere ""best friends"" are married to one another. Employer and employee are ""married"" from a certain form of view. One is ""married"" to one's pets if there is a mutual love, mutual dependence. Same-sex and, indeed differently sexed couples and even large groups of individuals have been marrying themselves to one another since before the dawn of this species we call ""humanity"". There is nothing anyone can do to prevent the emotional marriage of two or more individuals to one another if they so choose. They and their detractors often do not understand or, in the least, forget the fullest implications of the concept of ""marriage"". Certainly, those who rail against same-sex marriage as a potential redefinition of ""marriage"" seem to miss the irony of their very limited understanding of the much broader concept. Communities may or may not be at liberty to suppress official recognition of a ""marriage"" of two or more people. As a more advanced thinker, I am little bothered by what communities allow or disallow on this issue. An authentic marriage is one of the heart, mind, spirit.No government, vote, voter, law or court can allow or disallow what is quite outside of their control. That communities create a bit of paper and a stamp and then deny some few to participate in ownership of that unnecessary paper and stamp is a ludicrous self inflation of childish human beings. Those genuinely committed to one another have no need of community approval."	FAVOR

[Thus, this violates the separation of   church and state  , which protects our   society   in both directions.]Here are my thoughts as extension of those shared in the post above me:1. why not have a new word that means marriage and is defined by religious institutions that support same-sex relationships?2. why not support that state and federal policies and protections refer to all relationships formed through weddings/ceremonies/courts as civil unions to encompass marriage and any other   religion  -defined relationships in addition to state recognized/defined relationships.Looking forward - the next questions1. If state and federal authorities, back out of the picture after calling everything remotely resembling marriage as a   civil union  , how will the argument approach resolution at the steps of the churches in the US?2.

Don't put things in quotes as if I said them when I clearly didn't. If you want to use quotes copy and paste, I have written plenty of stuff, I'm sure you can find something that will go to prove your point.If I am understanding you correctly, here is your argument: People are not being bigoted just because they don't want to be around people. Am I right so far? Because I agree with this part. Next you say: some people who don't want gays to get married only because they don't want to be around them. Is this correct?

No one is asking them to hang out with homosexuals, or even talk to them so I don't understand their rationale, but at least it's an explanation. So so far we agree.Now here's where your logic decides to jump off a cliff into a pile of razor blades after having swallowed a gallon of vodka and three bottles of sleeping pills: People are not being bigoted, or intolerant when they allow their discomfort of being around gays to affect their decisions as to whether gays should be allowed to get married. Is this the basic point your making? If not ignore the rest of the argument and clarify your position, but if so keep reading. Denying others rights because you don't like their lifestyle is intolerant and bigoted. I may not like people with your opinions but I would never try to take away your right to voice them. Here is where the difference lies. You are allowed to be uncomfortable with how people live. I admit, I would be pretty uncomfortable around a man who wore nothing but a thong all day, but I wouldn't take away his rights. I could decide not to hang out with the thong-man. I might purposefully avoid him, but I would not take away his rights or the rights of all the thong-men in the entire state. Why? Because I know that if my lifestyle was not the popular or accepted one then I would not want people trampling on my rights.Your metaphor is an inaccurate one for two reasons: A) there is no logic in a groups wanting to change the name of their condition; and (this is the important one) B) homosexuals aren't forcing anything on people, merely asking for the same rights as afforded to others.

As Baal was the embodiment of the generative principle in nature, so was Ashtoreth of the receptive and productive principle. She was the great nature goddess, the Magna Mater, regent of the stars, queen of heaven, giver of life, and source of woman's fecundity...    [Canaanite religion was notable for] the prevalence of licentious orgies [involving shrine prostitutes] and of human sacrifice... Early rabbis describe the image of Moloch as a human figure with a bull's head and outstretched arms; and the account which they give is confirmed by what Diodorus relates of the Carthaginian Kronos...    ÒÔIn the worship of Astarte [Ashtoreth, the ancient Canaanite fertility goddess]    prostitution of women, and of effeminate men [shrine prostitutes], played the same part that child murder did in the worship of Baal...        [Pagan worshipers believed] no service more acceptable could be rendered a deity than that of unchastity... Thus lust itself became a service of the gods...Õ        One fruit of this system was the extraordinary institution of the Galli. [Rawlinson equates the Galli [shrine prostitutes] with the KJVÕs ÔsodomitesÕ - the ÔqedeshaÕ of the Hebrew text.]        The Galli were men, who made themselves as much like women as they could, and offered themselves for purposes of unnatural lust [unnatural in the sense of not procreative] to either sex [shrine prostitutes]. Their existence may be traced in Israel and Judah, [I Kings 14:24, 15:12] as well as in Syria and PhÏnicia.        At great festivals, under the influence of strong excitement, amid the din of flutes and drums and wild songs, a number of the male devotees would snatch up swords or knives, which lay ready for the purpose, throw off their garments, and coming forward with a loud shout, proceed to castrate themselves openly...        They joined with the priests and the sacred women at festival times in frenzied dances and other wild orgies, shouting, and cutting themselves [much like the prophets of Baal in I Kings 18:19, 28] on the arms, and submitting to be flogged one by another...Ó        (from George Rawlinson, History of Phoenicia, 1889, Chapter XI.)

It seems to me that if we were to discount what Lev 18 says on the basis that it was God prohibiting any kind of idolatrous sex ritual, we would see the inclusion of sex with your heterosexual spouse.It seems to me that God is giving instruction for a broader context.

If it has ever meant anything other than that, then I would like to see that proof.When racists said that a black person could not marry a white person, they lost in the courts because the historical definition has been ""a union between a man and a woman"" not ""a union between a man and a woman of the same race.""Racists did not try to claim ownership of the word.

826	gayRights	Call it bisexual or call it moving on from   homosexuality  .  That is why I said sex is plastic.  I will check up on Bonobo social bonding etc... but if the core data is from other primate studies....I really doubt it then, but I should not be bias until I see it.    Of course, not all physiological/morphological expressions can be attributed to one gene (1:1)--there are secondary, tertiary etc... levels of gene interactions and not to forget the myriad levels of hormones/steroids (endocrine/exocrine).My concern is to come across, with   science  , that there is no more room for argument and discussion, because science has not provided the proof in the pudding either way on this issue.  Not that you have done this yest, just my general concern.  Science can and is shedding light but there is a large difference between normative and descriptive.  Humans cannot live on science alone (normative) but must hold on to all the arts (which also reveal/has truth).	AGAINST

""Why would so many of us make this ""choice"" if we didn't have to?""Extemporaneously I can answer this quite easily.  The lack of knowledge of a choice does not preclude the possibility of a choice.  Furthermore, it does not follow logically that if someone makes a choice that he or she understands the potential consequences sufficiently so as to dissuade his or her mind from making that choice.  Finally, just because a choice may carry with it negative consequences does not mean he or she will choose against it.  Quite obviously, many people make choices which harm themselves (if you consider   homosexuality   and its consequences as ÒharmfulÓ, which apparently you do) all of the time.

The lack of a clear and agreed definition of a word makes it impossible for people to have a reasonable debate on the subject pertaining to that word.Indeed by confusing the meaning of the word ""marriage"", it makes it impossible for people to rationally discuss it.A new word or phrase should be chosen so as not to do harm to the existing meaning of words, while at the same time recognizing the essential characteristics of what is to be described by the word or phrase.The new practice of what may be called a ""heteroracial union"" is new, because it carries with it recognition under the law, which is unprecedented.

Indeed the word ""marriage"" has no synonym which can be used in its place, unlike the word ""interracial"" which can be replaced in usage by the word ""miscegenation""; So the destruction or redefinition of the word ""marriage"" is hurtful to the language in a way that can not be easily mended.It is precisely the confusion over the definition of the words which has caused so much apparent disagreement which could have been avoided with adequate clarity and agreement over the definitions of the words which they are arguing over.In conclusion, the phrase ""interracial marriage"" hurts users of language by confusing the established meaning of words, making rational discussion impossible. The phrase ""interracial marriage"" is describing something new in that it claims legal status. Therefore, one should pick another set of words that do not harm the established meaning of words in use.

The phrase should instead be ""heteroracial union"" or some other phrase that recognizes the nature of the relationship, while at the same time not doing harm to the long established meaning of the word ""marriage"".

840	gayRights	"Actually, there is a scientifically high probability that homosexuality contributes positively to the well-being of the species.  Typically, genetic traits which lead to reproductive success are the most strongly and consistently represented traits in a population.  After all, if you have a gene which makes you reproductively successful, you are likely to reproduce more and therefore your trait will continue strongly into the next and subsequent generations.And yet, there is good evidence that a small but fairly consistent percentage of the population has been homosexual throughout recorded history.  Since a ""gay gene"" would tend to detract from reproductive success (yes, you can snicker now :) ), why would such a gene be selected for?  The fact that we are beginning to discover that there is not one singular ""gay gene,"" but rather most likely a complex interaction of genes (and probably some factors from the intrauterine environment, as well) which cause an individual to be same-gender-oriented, suggests that some of those genes may also be beneficial to the species in other ways, perhaps providing protection from disease or other reproductively-desirable traits.  Think of the gene which causes Sickle-cell Anemia.  This gene is recessive, and will not cause disease if it is inherited from only one parent.  If inherited from both parents, the offspring manifests the disease, which can be deadly.  This gene is nearly non-existent in much of the world's population, because its tendency to reduce life-expectancy means that it does not give a reproductive advantage under normal circumstances, and therefore self-extinguishes after a number of generations.However, in areas of the world where Malaria is common, like Africa, this gene provides a distinct reproductive advantage, in that someone who is a carrier of the gene (has the recessive from one parent but not from the other) is given some degree of immunity to Malaria, and therefore has a reproductive advantage over someone with no Sickle-cell gene at all.  Therefore, in African populations, there is a high occurrence of Sickle-cell Anemia, because more carriers are at a reproductive advantage over non-carriers.The same is likely true with some or all of the genes which influence sexual orientation.  While Uncle Bill may get the full set and find that he is attracted to other men, Aunt Jane may only receive a partial set of the genes and actually be more fertile than other women, or produce offspring which are smarter, more attractive or otherwise have a survival and/or reproductive advantage.  Those offspring will also be carriers of some or all of the set of genes which increase the probability of becoming same-gender-oriented.  Some of them may marry spouses who carry some of the complement of genes, and may, themselves, produce one or more gay offspring.It really does make sense from an evolutionary perspective."	FAVOR

873	gayRights	"Turning to the Bible as a guide to determine whether homosexual behavior is viewed as sin, there can be no denial that there are some ten or more biblical texts which clearly reference homosexual practices or behavior in one form or another in the combined Old and New testaments.  Further, there also should be no denial that every one of these texts describes homosexuality in a negative light, as unacceptable to the people who believed they understood the mind and will of their God. People who lived across many centuries and cultures!	As Christians for whom ""sola scriptura"" is important, we believe we can go to the Bible for guidance and counsel. We have believed it is a reliable and inspired source for truth, assistance and direction. When we do, we find ourselves in the company of many who are engaged in an intense scrutiny of these ten scripture passages in the Old and New Testaments which focus on this issue. Both traditional biblical interpreters and so-called revisionist biblical interpreters have engaged in extensive analysis of these passages to find evidence, which supports their respective positions. 	Unfortunately the scriptural debate about homosexuality often only focuses on these ten passages and their historical, cultural meanings. In doing so, it neglects the larger worldview which the Bible teaches about holiness, godliness, sin and self-discipline. It misses the forest for the trees. The debate has been often argued from the particular to the general. The Bible is much more than the sum of itÕs parts. The Bible is the book of inspired writings which embodies a godly spirit or worldview because it embodies the Spirit of God.  	In the Book of Leviticus (RSV) for instance, there are two passages which have received much attention: Leviticus 18:22 says, ""You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination."" The other is Leviticus 20:13 Ð ""If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.""	These prohibitions in Leviticus are representative passages concerning this issue. They are especially useful for grasping the biblical worldview of which these verses are specific examples. I contend that it is this biblical worldview from which we are able to best grasp an accurate perspective about same-sex attraction and sexual behavior. It is a biblical worldview which God asks His followers to adopt. It is His point-of-view which God asks us to adopt. He asks us to get the Spirit of his mind and heart. 	Bible-believing Christians donÕt live on the basis of one or two or twenty verses of scripture. We live within a worldview of principles, standards, morals, values and ideals which the Bible teaches from Genesis through Revelation. Taken as a whole, this worldview represents the mind and heart and will of a loving Father God.	This is obvious from the people who come for Sexual Orientation Resolution Therapy (SORT). No one has ever come into therapy saying, ""Hey, you know what, I just read Leviticus 18:22 and I donÕt want to be abominable anymore!"" Everyone who has entered resolution therapy or come to our support group, and who has been successful at resolution does so because they understand the Bible generally and have grasped the heart of their Father God. They understand the Word cumulatively as a worldview in which same-sex sexual behavior is unacceptable to God. The biblically faithful SSA Christian client in therapy understands that in the biblical context, a God-view of homosexual behavior is sinful. "	AGAINST

If we legalized gay marriage in the U.S. then people would think its ok and safe but there are so many negative effects such as STDÕS I realize that there are STDÕS in other places too but the risk of getting them is a lot higher when being in a gay sexual relationship.

There are many times I refer my children to their other parent to answer certain questions or address particular topics.  There are also many times when she does the same to me.  We each have individual areas of expertise, and individual areas of responsibility within the family.  This is not something unique to heterosexual couples, nor is it necessarily gender-specific.  There are many men (even heterosexual men) who might gravitate towards some ""traditionally feminine"" areas of expertise, and vice versa for women.  Getting hung up on which parent has which sort of genitalia ignores the fact that all of us are different and bring different skills, abilities, perspectives and interests to our relationships and to our parenting.Evidence clearly demonstrates that same-gender-parented kids are equally happy, healthy and well-adjusted as compared to their opposite-gender-parented peers.

901	gayRights	Within my varied circle of friends is a lesbian couple in their early 50s who have been together for 30 years. They live in inner-suburban Sydney, Australia, where pretty much, no-one cares about the gender(s) of a couple. They are happy, stable and affluent thanks to years of hard work and long, steady careers.They have a son who has just finished high school. One of his parents is his birth mother; the other is related through the sperm of the father.Their son is a handsome, good-natured, polite, clever and amiable boy with a bright future because in a free, open society like Australia, no church overwhelms the moral judgments of the population, and he is at no disadvantage.In the US the problem is not the gender of the couple; it is the society around them that disadvantages the children. Unfortunately this kind of issue is always a numbers thing. The law moves slowly behind society - but when does any law on a moral issue precede the need or want of the population? So there has to be a critical mass of people demanding legal recognition: the pioneers. These pioneers have managed very well to raise children despite the lack of societal and legal support in the US.It has always struck me as strange that a country who is so consumed by the supposed welfare of these children is only now beginning to look at a system of universal health care that many other developed countries (e.g. UK, Sweden, Australia, Canada, France) have had for decades. Certainly there would be more harm done to US children whose families are damaged or compromised by the burden of inferior public health care or unethical insurers than anything affecting children of gay couples. The US moral masses should get their priorities right.By the way, Australia has just formally identified dozens of ways in which our current laws disadvantage gay people. Right now, these are in the process of being rewritten. It's a wonderful thing for our society. I look forward to the day when everyone is equal at law and our community is comprised of many different types of people, all contributing their diversity to a rich and elevated way of living.

Many of the rights and benefits of marriage are specifically for the benefit and protection of children, and many gay families DO have children.

Millions of years of   evolution   have caused men and women to adapt to the best model to preserve the species. One is not less than the other, but they are different. It takes the combined natural adaptations of both to produce an individual that is able to survive and reproduce in turn.You can argue until hell freezed over but you will never legislate natural   law   out of existance. Yeah, maybe it'd be better if pi was equal to 3 instead of 3.145926....., but wishful thinking will never make it so. It is what is and we are what we are. I do not mean to be unkind, but   homosexuality   is not a survival characteristic, it's an evolutionary dead end. You can argue that other alternatives to the traditional family unit are equally contra survival, perhaps even with some small merit, but that doesn't   change   the fact that the traditional family unit provides the best possible   benefits   to   children  .Children are not   pets  . I can't even begin to express how low my opinion is of anyone who would use children as bargaining chips as a way to legitimize their own lifestyle choices. If you want a pet, get a puppy or a kitten. Better yet, start with a nice house plant and if it's still alive after a year, get a fish or a hamster. With experience, you may eventually become competent to care for a critter as complex as a   baby   cat or dog. The big difference between a pet kitten and a human child is with the kitten, you are not responsible for teaching it everything it will need to know to survive for the 50 plus years it will live after leaving your care.I have a high opinion of free will even though I don't always agree with the way it is exercised. If you're gay, I fully respect your right to be left alone to make the best life you can for yourself. The moment you say you should be allowed to impose your will on another, you will find me in adament opposition to your position.

The state has no right to dictate the actions of the church. This is a violation of the constitution the state is overstepping its bounds and its encroaching upon the rights of the church. This is an effort to take away the churches power and moral effectiveness. The constitution recognizes the churches role in a free society and the church itself is a needed structure in society, The framers of the constitution recognize and respects the soverignty of God HIS laws and the churches authority to declare them and enforce them.

910	gayRights	"I actually know of a few, who maybe don't ""resent"" being adopted, but wished they had their actual parents, and blame a lot of their psychological problems on the fact that they weren't raised by their parents.  Only in THIS time, does this scenario hold so much value. When someone is born by an accident, and then is not wanted, and is raised poorly because of the fact. Why are adoption programs established in the first place? Because there are more people having sex that don't want children, there are more people without the means to have children, but want children, and there are more people out there suffering from bad parenting. This hasn't always been the case, see what I've said to Kukla.  The chances of ""accidentally"" having children, and the chances of not being able to care for the child, have to be higher now than any other time in history, partly due to the fact that there are just more people in general out there at this moment than any other specific time in history. If the failure rate is higher now than ever, and the number of gays raising children are higher than ever too, logically, the percent of failure has to effect the lower number, the gay adopters, more than the people having the children by accident. Also, something to conceder is, why are they failing? If it's because of the income, look at the percent of failure with a mother and father in the same income bracket than the adopter's, you will find that there is a wide gap. Most accidental births, I'm sure, are well taken care of despite the fact that they weren't planned, more often in a higher income bracket than a lower. The people with a low income will fail, whereas the people in the higher one, even though it's accidental, will be taken care of just as well as ones raised by adopters, because they are given money, and already have the money to do so. In all of time, there have been more straight couples with money and children than gay couples with money and children... think about it. Statistically speaking, the straight people may have failed more people over the coarse of history, but that doesn't mean that they haven't also raised more children successfully too."	AGAINST

I think that same sex couples should bypass th liberal right and secure civil unions because the rights afforded to married couples are more important than the word ""married."" Would you rather use the word ""married"" but not have any rights or have the rights but not the word? I know you want both but think about this. Demanding both has resulted in a backlash. The religious right was able to spend less and out organize the gay community in order to get proposition 8 passed. What does that tell you? It tells me that the religious right is deeply offended at the demands made by the gay community. The religious right feels (right or wrong) that the word belongs to them. The gay community has not understood this and has made matters worse by claiming that the religious right is hateful (I know because I've seen the bumper stickers). This is really strange because in poll after poll people seem OK with civil unions. It is as though the gay community is so focused on their goal that they fail to hear what the religious right is saying and when they do hear they (truly or intentionally) misunderstand the words and misrepresent them. The religious right is willing to give the gay community its rights....., but not the word. And all the litigation in the world will never force the majority of the religious right that are currently alive to accept gays as married. If anything, litigation will have an opposite effect.The gay community will eventually win this battle but (if they continue using the current approach) the damage done to the relationship between the two groups will suffer greatly. The gay community is alienating the religious right. I know that the gay community feels that they are the ones being alienated by the religious right. But think about this. How would you feel if some homeless guy came into your home and (not negotiated but) demanded a place to sleep? You have the room. You don't need it all at any given point in time. He will have all kinds of reasons why he should be allowed to sleep there. And if you refuse because it is your home and he shouldn't be making demands, he'll say that you're a hateful person.Don't bother answering because if there's anything I have learned is that you can't change a person's mind with just an argument. Just as you wont change mine. And since you have made it clear that friendship to you means that I have to (not only accept but actually) share your point of view, I accept your request to be enemies. I respect your point of view but I don't share it.One last thing. This is hokey, I know, but it does seem to make me feel better sometimes. Maybe it will make you feel better.God give me the strength to change the things I can,the patience to put it with the things I can't,and the wisdom to know the difference."	FAVOR

915	gayRights	This argument is quite simple. Either homosexuality is a choice, or it is something you are born with. Having never made the choice to be heterosexual, I believe it is a natural phenomenon that people are born with. Perhaps it is God's way of limiting population growth. To those that believe it is a choice, did YOU ever choose to be heterosexual? If it is not a choice, then there is no point arguing the morality of it. Morality involves choices you make. It would be like saying being black is immoral. It's simply idiotic.	FAVOR

920	gayRights	"I believe same-sex marriages should be legal. I believe that the arguments against it are poor and are based on personal beliefs rather than logic.1) Denying gays and lesbians the right to marry is unconstitutional. It discriminated on the basis of sex. It also denies them of the many benefits of civil marriage such as:  to call out of work to take care of a sick partner or partner's child, to receive social security continuation after a partner dies, file joint tax returns, etc. If two people are in a committed, monogamous relationship they should be able to get married and fulfill their promises to each other. 2)  Some say that they are against gay marriage because the definition of marriage is ""an institution between one man and one woman."" But WHO says what marriage is to be defined by? Their argument basically stops there because there is nothing else to add to it. It is word manipulation because definitions are never set in stone. They develop over the years as does language in general. Other words are given multiple meanings and connotations yet we seem to be stuck with just ONE for marriage. Tradition seems to be the only thing that keeps this definition from changing and in the past tradition has lost. Just look at slavery and the treatment of women.3) ""Marriage is for reproduction."" What about infertile couples? A post menopausal mother or a impotent father cannot reproduce. Are they not allowed to marry? Actually, they are. So how is this a valid argument?4) Same-sex couples do not provide the best environment to raise children in.  But heterosexual couples ALWAYS do? What about the rapists, child molesters, murderers, alcoholics, and other harmful personalities are free to marry and procreate and raise children all they want. Yes, there are organizations that help children in those situations but do they get to all of them? And isn't the child already affected negatively from the experience? Gay couples can raise children just as well as straight couples can. The difference is that gay couples are looked down on and that can affect the children and it does. If homosexuals were treated equally then what differences would there be? And would they -really- be significant and worthy of being mentioned in an argument?5) Same-sex relationships are immoral. Says who? Give me valid, unbiased sources and I will acknowledge it and actually have an argument. I will not argue over faith based arguments or personal beliefs.6) Same-sex marriages threaten the institution of marriage. This to be sounds contradictory. By allowing gays to marry we eliminate marriages that some of them would enter with people they do not love and are not fully attracted to. Gay marriages do not threaten the institution of marriage. If anything they simply strengthen it. Divorce, if anything, is what threatens it.7) Same-sex marriages are untested social experiments. This is a very narrow-minded argument because it implies that nowhere in the world have there been same sex marriages, while also degrading the relationships of same-sex couples. Calling someone's relationship and love ""an experiment"" is less of an argument than a personal attack. And same-sex marriages have been ""tested"" and successful in countries such as: Canada, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, etc. It doesn't seem to pose a problem there so why would it in America?To me these arguments are all excuses for the real reasons people oppose gay marriage. The reason I say this is because in each argument there is a flaw or contradictions. It is easy for people to dismiss something they find repulsive, unnatural, or that makes them uncomfortable, but that doesn't make it okay to deny a group of people the right to be married. "	FAVOR

Now a question..if a woman has the right to love a man, why cant a woman love a woman or a man love a man? Love is love and it has no gender. You cant help who you love. Who is anyone in this world to say who someone else can fall in love with? People say that being gay is choice. Well, heres another question..do you wake up in the morning and say ""hey, I think I'm going to be straight today""? I don't think so. You are not born straight or gay. You are born asexual. You have no sexual orientation. As you grow and develop you become attracted to things and for some its the opposite sex and for others its the same sex. Gays are as normal as straights or anything else in this world. Besides, who are any of us to say what NORMAL is? I've been on several websites about this gay marriage thing and most of them argued that it wouldnt be right in the eyes of ""god"". Now, I dont believe in god, but if there is in fact a god than why would he have made gays if he wouldnt approve of them? It just doesnt make any sense. Other websites have tried arguing that gays are the reason for AIDS and STDS. This is not true. If you search for the answer to the quesion ""where did AIDS orginate from?"" you would find several different answers, but none would say anything about gays. People are trying their hardest to prove that homosexuality should not be allowed by throwing false information around and that will get you no where. Another thing that people are trying say is that gay parents will raise gay children. This isn't true either. This goes back to the asexual thing. If you're going to be gay you are going to be gay. It doesn't matter who raises you or what your religion is or anything that you have any control over. I know a gay couple bothwho has two daughters  of which are straight. So that is proof that that suggestion is indeed false. And as for the statements saying that gay marriages are unatural because in ""traditional"" marriages the man and woman can have children, there are plenty of straight couples out there that are popping out children left and right! It doesn't matter how many gays there are because there will always be straight couples and there will always be more children being born. And as for gays, there are plenty of ways for them to also have children. So lets put that arguement to a rest, please! Gays deserve the same rights as straights. Gays are no different than straights. They wake up every morning and they have a life. The only thing thats different about them is they love someone of the same sex rather than the opposite. There is absolutely no reason why a gay couple should not be able to get married and have the same rights as a straight couple. "	FAVOR

933	gayRights	"Okay, let me first make it clear that I never condoned violent action as a way to solve the problem. Gandhi and MLK Jr. are some of my heroes because they affected change in the most peaceful ways possible. What I also liked about them is they both recognized injustice and stood up to it without compromise. Gandhi wanted the British out of India and did not compromise on this issue. Martin Luther King wanted equal rights for African-Americans and did not compromise. There is a big difference between not wanting to compromise, and being narrow minded. You say ""Some people just don't want to be around other people."" This to me is a type of discrimination. If I told you, I am not bigoted, I just don't want to be around Mexicans, you would be appalled.Here is the definition of a bigot in wikipedia:A bigot is a person who is intolerant of opinions, lifestyles, or identities differing from his or her ownLooking at this definition you can see clearly that not wanting to be around people who choose to be homosexual is bigotry. But that is irrelevant because no one is forcing people to be around homosexuals. This is what I don't understand about your argument. If homosexuals get married does that mean suddenly they are going to suddenly show up at your door, and when you refuse them say ""Hey, you have to let us in, we're legally married now."" That is ridiculous.Of course legalizing gay marriage will not automatically get rid of bigots, I never said that and I don't believe it. When slavery was abolished, did it get rid of racism? When woman's suffrage was granted, did it get rid of sexism? No! But in the long run it helped a lot. Can you imagine anyone believing either of these issues as having two reasonable sides today? The bigots will not change their mind, but their children will be raised in a society that is more accepting, and hopefully this will have a large affect for future generations.Being intolerant of bigotry cannot be called bigotry.I agree that maybe gay marriage will not come to fruition in the immediate future, but that does not mean that people should stop fighting for what they believe in. Martain Luther King demanded equal rights for African-Americans. Feminists demanded equal rights for women. Asking nicely, ""can we please get married, if it isn't to much of a problem for you?"" Of course what blacks suffered through in the pre-civil rights era was terrible. That does not lessen what homosexuals are going through right now. I know from seeing it at my school how much homosexuals are mistreated and outcast. This is socially acceptable, and it shouldn't be. Progress will probably be attained in smaller steps but only if people continue to fight for their rights. Obama is the perfect example of this: in order to win the presidency he had to support civil unions but not gay marriage. Lucky for me, I'm not a politician. I don't have to temper my views with the current public will. I can say what I truly believe. If a compromise were reached in the federal government that extended rights to homosexuals through civil unions I would be in favor of that, but after it was passed I would go right back to fighting for marriage. Homosexuals even lost the ability to adopt in Arkansas because they can't marry or even have civil unions: I also have a problem with you comparing the Homosexuals to the Nazis. First, the Nazis killed homosexuals, because they thought they were, to use your word, ""vermin."" What the homosexuals are not doing is killing or hurting others in any way by demanding marriage. By denying them marriage, other people are hurting homosexuals. So who is more like the Nazi's now? Don't you think its justified to loathe your oppressors? This does not mean violence, as I said earlier I am against violence.Speaking of Bigotry though, I want you to see what homosexuals have to put up with: it unfair for me to call them bigots, or am I being narrow minded?Finally I would like to respond to this comment you made:I have said that gays will eventually win.

I dont know how you could even rationalize the fact that opening   marriage   up for a free for all would lead to a stronger society but a much weaker and distorted and psychologically imbalaced one and I hope that they would see that and that realizing that the road to hell is paved in roads such as the one that homosexual marriage will create in America.  It will weaken our family structure and thereby weaken our towns and eventually our country, if you dont think so remember what ERA for woman promised us, better futures more security etc blah blah and what did we actually get? Harder lives, more on our plates, expectations over the limit, family structure that fell apart without the mother role in the house, more   money   but that lead to more bills, more divorce rates because we allievated some of the mens responsiblities and that opened them up to the wondering eye, woman cheating on their husbands. Woman if we allow a redefinition of marriage we might as well just ask for the short end of the stick cuz thats what well get.	AGAINST
959	gayRights	The US is one of the few countries with a constitutional separation of church and state.Within such a system, marriage should only be defined by the state and 2 people (same or different sex) should go to city hall to get married. Priest should not be able to perform legal marriages.Only after a couple is legally married, should they have the option of going to a church of their choice to celebrate their marriage within the rituals of that church with their church community.Because of separation between church and state, churches have no say in how the state defines marriage but in pure symmetry, the state can not require churches to organize religious celebrations if they do not want to.Same sex marriage was legalized in the Netherlands in 2001, Belgium in 2003, Massachusetts in 2004, Spain and Canada in 2005, South Africa in 2006, California and Connecticut in 2008 and will be in Norway in 2009 (see       ).The sky has not fallen, heterosexual marriages have not disappeared and divorces have not exploded, these countries have not gone up in smoke, ... In fact, except for these happily married same sex couples, nothing has changed.So, don't be afraid of your own shadow and support same sex marriage.Society has to continue to eliminate any form of discrimination.

961	gayRights	Jeremy,I am not an expert, but I wonder if perhaps your comment was too limited in what it addressed.  You only addressed behavior outcomes within the context of our current strongly pro heterosexual society.  I seem to remember studies from many years ago that concluded that the natural human tendency was for people to be born with congenital preference across the full spectrum between pure hetero and pure homo with the vast majority in various shades of bi.  This preference is then shaped by the rubric of current social values that lead to the outcomes you describe.That would imply that far fewer people are Òborn gayÓ than you might expect.  It also mean that far fewer people are Òborn straightÓ than you might expect as well.  The conflict comes from all of those people in the middle forced to conform to the imposed unnatural social values.  Normally you would expect that the closer you are to one end of the spectrum the easier it is to move your outcome to conform, but human nature is more complex than that.  Then you have to deal with people that have what I describe as angry reformed behavior complex.  IÕm sure you know the type.  I made the sacrifice and quit (fill in what you want; smoking, drinking, being over weight, enjoying myself, whatever), Òhow dare you offend me and do that in front of me you weak willed sinner.Ó  Or the less angry who feel ÒI want to be good, please donÕt tempt me to take my life down that road of social scorn.Ó	FAVOR

""All gays are slutty"" is the only condition that would make your argument logically correct.  Sorry, I'm a huge nerd about logic.  Let me back it up a bit.  The question asked by this page is ""Is Homosexuality a Sin?""  Your answer (according to my own humble interpretation) breaks down to:""I don't know.  I can't say no, because gays are slutty and god is not a big fan of that. Also, gays can't marry and god doesn't like premarital sex either. If you say yes, I understand, but I cannot say yes myself because I don't like to hate."" That's actually a great, well-reasoned, and honest opinion.  I wish more religious folks had that view.  My point was just that the argument ""A is wrong, most B are A, therefore B is wrong too"" is not logically correct.  What about non-slutty gays?  They do exist, in fact 100% of the gay people in my close social circle are entirely monogamous.  That's because atheist ethics are how I roll, and many friends are like-minded or similar.  The point is, even if promiscuity is correlated to homosexuality, it's not the same thing, and god's condemnation of one does not automatically extend to the other.  As for marriage, the legal governmental form of marriage and the religious ceremony are not the same thing, and their endless confusion is a big problem in our country right now.  Gays can get married in a church.  Surely it's religious marriage, not civil marriage, that god required?  Even if you only count legal marriage, if you believe that premarital sex is a sin, again that is not the same thing as homosexuality.  The vast majority of heterosexuals also have premarital sex.  Using this logic, being an American is a sin.  Our disagreement is a matter of perspective, you're coming from a common-sense point, and I'm coming from a logical view (which is what opposing view is all about for me).  To use an analogy, suppose that giving birth were a sin.  Does that make being a woman a sin?  Most women have children, after all.  As for your comment about reconciling religion with ones lifestyle (which extends to a lot more situations than just homosexuality), amen to that!  Personally, I suspect the antagonistic nature of homosexuality vs. religion in the US is probably a contributing factor as to why homosexuality is so often correlated with promiscuity.  Of course, there are a lot of other factors correlated to promiscuity which are not, as far as I know, labeled sin.

The issue I have, though, is that elevating same-sex marriage to be the same as traditional marriage further denies the inherent differences between the sexes (the denial of which has already damaged society) and denies the ability of society to say that, wherever possible, a traditional married couple is preferred over all other options because of its proven superiority as a method of raising children.

If Focus were truly concerned about the welfare of kids, it would devote resources to placing more of them in loving homes rather than trying to undermine the ability of GLBT parents to be good parents to their foster and adoptive kids.Let's be clear: I didn't make my kids. A heterosexual couple did. And that same couple abused, neglected and ultimately abandoned them. They are my children and my husband's children now.

Kurtzman for testing the violation of the establishment clause of the First Amendment. It forces the government to decide which religions are legitimate and this ""needlessly entangles the government in religion."" Furthermore all of the money that is lost in exempt taxes from churches does not benefit the entire country, only members of that religion. Yes money that goes to charity benefits everyone, but then only that money should be deducted from their taxes and they should pay tax on the rest.

You see, one of the hemispheres of a woman's brain is slightly bigger than the other, while in men the hemispheres are the same size, which has long been known to be a reliable way to tell apart the sexes physically (besides the really obvious ways) Gay men had brains that resembled a woman's brain and vice versa for lesbian women. This basically proves irrefutably that homosexuality is not a so-called ""lifestyle choice"", but a born-in trait, determined in the womb. -Gay parenting will create screwed up kids by denying them a father or mother figure.

Actually, the fact that it is so old is even more of a reason for it to change. Our thinking has advanced since then and our institutions should reflect that .

Allow me to try again.People (and many species of animals) live in groups. People whose groups survive are able to pass on their genes. Those genetic traits which help the society as a whole to survive, are passed along. Therefore, if some homosexuality helps a group to survive and homosexuality is somehow genetic, then those groups with genes that cause a certain percentage of the population to be homosexual, will survive. In this way nature does ""see"" the effect of one person on another.In your second paragraph you argue that complex process, that can only be understood by intelligence, require an intelligent designer. I respect you as a debater, so I will not call your logic fucking retarded. Instead, I will point out that there are many process that exist, which are complicated, but also have natural explanations. The concept of quantum physics is complicated, so is planetary formation and biology...however each of these process has a natural explanation that can be ""proven"" by science. One could argue that all of these things came about by magic...but one may also want to repeat fourth grade science and leave the thinking to the adults.Third Paragraph: I talked about homosexual siblings helping their brothers reproduce. I got this from the video I posted. I have been able to find no other source for it... so I will not claim it to be fact. Nevertheless, as you said, religion helped not because it increased reproduction, but because it was beneficial to the societies survival (i.e. people didn't kill each other). Couldn't homosexuality have the same effect? If a percentage of the population being homosexual bonded the society in some way, wouldn't this be beneficial as well? This has been seen in animal populations.... although obviously not humans.As far as your argument that homosexuality causes a break in the genetic chain, and therefore wouldn't be passed on... please check out these lnks 1 and 2. They both talk about how the more older brothers you have, the more likely it is you're a homosexual. This means that the genes of homosexuals are still likely to be passed on through their older siblings, even though not directly.Finally we arrive at your most offensive argument, where you call homosexuals ""freaks of nature"".

It was believed that   women   were not created equal to men and women have a lower mental capacity than men; women must submit to men.

There are Bible verses that, when taken literally, support all of these statements.The churched condemned Galileo as a heretic because he said the earth revolved around the sun.

You genes only understand replication -- pure, straight-forward reproductive replication.  That's the purpose of our genes.  Our genes, our most rudimentary architect are designed to keep us alive and replicate themselves.  From an evolutionary point of view (which is the ONLY POV that your genes ""know"" homo-sexuality.  There's no possible way anyone's genes could EVER know   homosexuality   simply because that defies their very intention and nature (that of surviving and replicating).  So what does cause the sensation of homosexuality or the illusion of homosexuality in people?  Lower female sexual arousal.  Socetial, familial, social, historical incidents that caused a person to associate arousal and sex and attraction on a superficial level to the same sex.  But all of those are just superficial mental confusions or temporary experimentations.  Deep down (to our genes) we're all heterosexual.  Saying that people are gay genetically is like saying ""Well, some cars are meant to just jiggle in place and not move."" The purpose of a car is to provide transportation, just like the purpose of genes is to provide life and replicate.  If a certain contraption doesn't move forward or a bit of cellular   technology   doesn't create survival and replicate, you can't call those respectively, a car or genetic material.Now the arguments of the church are ABSURD.  IF (and this is a strong IF because we know from above genetic evidence that this is not true)  there was some way that someone could be genetically born to be gay, and this is purely hypothetical because we know what not to be true, but hypothetically if someone were genetically gay then outlawing a genetically-defined state would be absolutely absurd and akin to saying to people that they had to collect their sweat and consume it after perspiring."

987	gayRights	but we must be careful when we use the word love because as you and I know they mean very different things in different contexts.  The Bible is full of examples where people love eachother and are not married.  However, this love is not sexual.

In this case, according to definintion of complementarianisim you offered, I am not a complementarian.  Beyond the possibility of marriage great emotional and social needs and longings are met through parents, siblings, family, best friends, friends, partners, groups, classmates, co-workers, the church, small groups and so forth.

This is all good and decent granted the realtionships have a realtive level of health; i.e. not subject to co-dependency, violent, or otherwise harmful to the people invovled in those relationships.  What is reserved for marriage though is the fullness of sexual union as embodied in sexual union.

What about the woman sitting in the pew next to them who has been divorced, yet remarried again while her husbandÕs still alive?  ItÕs adultery.  People are judging based upon their interpretation of the bible, which ultimately separates people. The old law is just that: old.  Look at Galatians chapter two verses 17 through 21:""But what if we seek to be made right with God through faith in Christ and then find out that we are still sinners? Has Christ led us into sin? Of course not! Rather, I make myself guilty if I rebuild the old system I already tore down. For when I tried to keep the law, I realized I could never earn GodÕs approval. So I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ. I myself no longer live, but Christ lives in me. So I live my life in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I am not one for those who treats the grace of God as meaningless. For if we could be saved by keeping the law, then there was no need for Christ to die. That one sentence says it all: {ÒFor if we could be saved by keeping the law, then there was no need for Christ to die.Ó}Then you have this passage:ÒYou and I are Jews by birth, not ÔsinnersÕ like the Gentiles. And yet we Jewish Christians know that we become right with God, not by doing what the law commands, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be accepted by God because of our faith in Christ-and not because we have obeyed the law. ***For no one will ever be saved by obeying the law.***Ó ~Galatians 2:15-16Relying on JesusÕ sacrifice is why love between two people is not wrong.

1003	gayRights	"     The late Pope John Paul II was noted for quoting often the phrase ""Christ...fully reveals man to himself.""  from ""Gaudium et Spes.""  In the Christian tradition God and his commands are not ""up there"" far away in some Platonic other but right here, now in the present among us.  God came to Abram, his glory dwelt on Mt. Sinai with Moses, John the Baptist preached ""the Kingdom of God is at hand,"" Jesus, ""it is among us"" and Jesus the Christ himself is the incarnation of God.  God's Word came present not ""up there"" but in time, in history, in the lives and languages of a real culture of and society amongst real individuals.       Universal moral law is only true in so much as it is indeed universal and based in the common good.  Not the good of an individual or a group but as it is the good for all.  In order for this to be so it must somehow exist ontologically in its own right, objectively and not in the will of man for the will of man is not only corrupt but subjective.  In this case the only moral law that can actually be true and universal is that law which is given from God.  Any other attempt for man to construct there own law, there own morals, there own understanding of right and wrong, good and evil is in fact from the evil one.  To do so would nuance the falsity that we are god, or anyway like God.  (see Genesis 3).  Rather God calls us into relationship with him not only because it is the good for us to do but because it is the purpose for which we are created.  God not only calls us to himself as an action of doing but as an action of being because it is who we are, after all God calls us into being.       How is it reconciled then, that we as humans need a morality that is actually attainable that isn't beyond our reach  that is as you said ""for people.""  God knows that his law is to high for people to achieve (see Romans 7).  This is precisely why he came not as other but as man and in doing so made the way for man to experience not only holiness and righteousness (as accorded by his law) but true peace with God and right relationship with him.  Jesus' humanity is evidence that it is possible and he is the way to our eternal Father, our divine Creator.  Jesus affords the way we must choose weather one will take that, accept God's offer of freedom and redemption or continue to neglect him and his holiness by living in sin.  Societies likewise, can compromise the truth and go on living ""as every man sees fit"" with the illusion of justice by ""living and letting live."" But dies this ""live and let live"" really provide true justice?  What about the injustice of psychological distress within a man, is this accounted for? Not because ""live and let live"" only accounts for interpersonal relationship not the inner justice of man.  Or how about acts of ""so called freedom"" that actually bring further bondage?  Are they ok if only consent is given?  Prostitution, fornication, drunkenness, consumerism?  All of these things go on under the guise of false justice, ie. live and let live, but in reality they continue to demean the integrity and intrinsic value of the human person.  The justice based in the reality that all men are created  equal is the justice of God for he has endowed men with such unalienable rights as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Each human person, all men, all women, those who believe they are homosexual and those who do not, those born, those unborn, those dying they are all worth so much to God that he he gave his only begotten son to die that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting, full, life.  Christ speaks the freeing word, the word of liberty over all those who call on his name as they become who they truly are before sin and bondage and oppression came to foul our fallen race.  Jesus saves.  Jesus calls us to our original purpose, he is the fulfillment of our happiness.  True morality and justice accounts to the full truth of the human being and human experiance accroding to him who knows all things and all things about us, according to him who walked among us and made a way for real people, and who calls us into realtionship with him and gives us to the power to live holy, lives of right action and right being by putting His Spirit in those who believe in him.  This Spirit is the Lord the giver of life, who reigns with the Father and the Son, One God overall, for all, in love with all.  including you friend,Peace,Spencer"	AGAINST
1004	gayRights	While the teachings of the Church are clear that homosexuality is unnatural, to make blanket statements that Òthe followers of the Catholic Church believe that homosexuality is wrongÓ is not only false, but, as a Catholic, one that I take personal offense to.  The Church is one of the largest religious denominations in the world, among Christians and among all faiths, encompassing over one billion people.  There are many faucets of Catholicism unique to the faith, but, even though public deviation is not well tolerated, dissent does occur, even in the church hierarchy.  As for the faith of the laypeople, it is often a personal matter and faith does not necessary lay contingent on complete adherence to dogma, but rather the belief of at least the core principles of Catholicism.I believe that is the will of God that we should respect other peoplesÕ religious beliefs, and that to join Church and State at any level would be to force, in this case, the Catholic faith upon all people of the United States.

Any chance you can link us to the documentation that shows the percentage of homosexuals amongst circumcised males, sexually abused children and lower class income people?  My first reaction is that is totally bogus information, so if you can back that up with some actually scientific research, that would be helpful.If I made some assumptions from what you've said, then most (over 50%?) of men in America must be homosexuals, because most males born in the US are circumsized.  One could also assume that blacks make up a large percentage of lower income families, so most blacks are homosexual.  So the odds of a black man being heterosexual in America, must be pretty slim!!  But then, as we recently saw in California, most blacks voted for prop 8, so I'm guessing most blacks aren't homosexual, and it's just my guess, but I'd think most American men are also heterosexual.There have been some scientific studies that are finding some evidence of genetic predisposition, but they are not conclusive either.

Allowing same-sex marriage makes a statement to society, whether you agree or not, that a male parent and a female parent is no longer ideal.  It deprives a child of the inherent right to have a mother and a father as an ideal family.  Once a society removes that distinction, it can no longer say that a child should have a mother and father if possible instead of a same-sex set of parents.At heart is the fact that this denies the scientifically documented (as if we needed it) differences between men and women.

We've noticed!!!Ancient Jewish writers frequently linked same sex shrine prostitution with the prohibitions in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13.For example, every passage in the Bible which is alleged to prohibit same sex partnerships, when read in doctrinal or historical context, is always referring to shrine prostitution. The human authors of the Bible did this intentionally because they were not referring to homosexuality in general and they most assuredly were not referring to female-female partnerships since those partnerships are never prohibited in the Old Testament.            Philo, the Alexandrian Jewish writer was a contemporary of Jesus and the Apostle Paul. Philo believed that Moses' use of arsenos koiten in Leviticus 20:13 referred to shrine prostitution.

1025	gayRights	Struggling with homosexuality is not necessarily a sin. The sin is actually giving into those desires both mentally and physically.

As a matter of fact, I know gay men that have told me they don't believe they were born gay, and still live in that lifestyle. Something that I noticed gay men struggle with is seeing themselves as the men that they were born as. I've asked a couple guys living in that lifestyle, about if they felt like men (even at an early age) and if they ever felt like they had to measure up to what they feel being a man is ( I know that was my case and as I mentioned before, plus I've asked other men who live in the gay lifestyle, and they could relate to me). Another thing that is important to consider is the issue of envy. I believe The reason of why I liked certain kinds of men was because I they happened to have some sort of physical or intellectual feature that I wanted to have, but felt like I didn't have. For example, let's say a certain man ( dealing with homosexuality) wants to have darker skin. He will (most likely) be attracted to men that have darker skin. Now that doesn't mean that he will never feel attracted to someone that has lighter skin, since they might have something that they want to have (physically or mentally).	AGAINST

1040	gayRights	"Let's examine what the companion passage to Mark 10, says, since Matthew 19 is the major passage used to clobber gay people on the topic of marriage.Matthew 19:3-12 deals with GodÕs view of heterosexual marriage and natural exceptions to heterosexual marriage as Jesus intended His followers to understand them. Jesus says some eunuchs are born that way, from their mother's womb. Jesus does not say born eunuchs enter the world with genital deformities. Instead, He makes a distinction between born eunuchs and eunuchs who have been physically castrated (suffered genital deformity) by illness or by men. Jesus also makes a clear distinction between born eunuchs and eunuchs who make a choice to voluntarily abstain from marriage, for the kingdom of heaven.In Matthew 19, Jesus cites Adam and Eve as the norm for marriage but carefully makes exception for people called eunuchs. According to Jesus, a eunuch is one who cannot receive His teaching about heterosexual marriage according to the Adam and Eve model. Jesus informs us that of the three classes of eunuchs, the first class is born that way. In other words, born eunuchs are not physically castrated and born eunuchs are not required to abstain from marriage with an orientation compatible partner. They are born eunuchs from their motherÕs womb, unable to receive JesusÕ teaching about the Adam and Eve marriage model yet Jesus differentiates between them and castrated eunuchs and them and metaphysical eunuchs (eunuchs who make a personal decision not to marry).History demonstrates that what we call gay men today, were called eunuchs by our spiritual ancestors. In Matthew 19:12, Jesus very clearly says born eunuchs, what today we call homosexuals, were born that way.In case you doubt that born eunuchs were gay people, please note that Dr. Robert Gagnon, the leading anti-gay crusader of the twenty-first century, admits that:""Probably 'born eunuchs' in the ancient world did include people homosexually inclined...""When even Dr. Robert Gagnon, our most vociferous opponent, admits this historical fact, our argument is largely won.

1043	gayRights	"Let me show you what Romans 1 says:So homosexuality is viewed as ""alright"" in this passage? That definitely is not the case. Here it says: ""For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.""So it states that ""homosexuality"" is not ""NATURAL"" and that the men also received the ""Due Penalty"" for their error (men and women committing ""unatural"" relations with same gender).It then goes onto say: "" 29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, 31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.""Here it tells us that those who practiced ""unnatural relations"" with same gender, were filled with unrighteousness, evil, malice, etc. It says they also not only commit all these acts, but give approval to others to do the same. It says the ""God's decree"" to those who practice such things is to ""die.""So again, explain to me.... why is homosexuality not a sin? Do you know what the term sin means. Sin is essentially ""rebellion against God."" If God says that practicing same gender sex is against his decree, which means those who practice are ""rebelling against God's decree,"" therefore that means they are ""sinning.""

Rational truth, as you call it, is based on sensory-perceptual evidence that can be observed, analyzed, discussed, and debated.  Those are things that the human mind is excellent at doing.  Rational moral truth is based on the observation that people are all basically the same, that they have the same fundamental physical, psychological, and spiritual needs (by ""spiritual"" I do NOT mean, religious or supernatural.  I merely mean needs that are not physical).  ""A rational ""Live-and-Let-Live"" morality is based on the observation that people thrive when left to do as they please as long as they don't harm anyone else.  Hence homosexuality is NOT immoral.  These observations can be made by anyone, and are clearly demonstrable whether we consider them on an individual level or on a societal level.  In contrast, Religious truth is based on faith (i.e. belief WITHOUT evidence).  I do think that people who believe that the bible is the literal word of god ARE irrational (at least in that one aspect of their lives).  One can only believe the literalness of the bible by ignoring the immense body of historical and scientific evidence that utterly contradicts that assertion.  It's not enough to believe something very strongly.  Your belief must be plausible, supported by the evidence, and not explicable by a simpler, more plausible explanation.  I would think that the existence of so many faiths in the world each claiming mutually contradictory moralities would give pause to theists who think that their particular moral biases are the ""right"" ones.  Do you think you were just lucky to be born into a Christian society while Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, etc., were unluckily born into the ""wrong"" ones? You ask ""How is rational truth objective when it is the product of human minds, which tend to be very subjective?""  Well, how is religious truth objective when it is ALSO the product of the human mind?  The fact that you deny that your beliefs are the product of human minds doesn't change the fact that they are.  The bible was written, rewritten, altered, edited, interpreted, reinterpreted by PEOPLE.  How many different versions of the Christian bible exist today?  Why were some gospels removed by the Council of Nicea? What about the 80% of the human race that don't believe in the new testament?  And I haven't even begun to list the myriad scientific proofs against literalism. The only way you can believe in the literalness of the bible in the face overwhelming evidence that it's not literally true is if you are willfully blind.  And I believe that willful blindness is irrational and dangerous.  Men of faith flew planes into skyscrapers on 9/11.  Faith scares me.  Lastly you ask ""What objective [evidence] exists to show that the Bible is not God's word? ""  I just barely started to list the evidence above.  There is much more.  But it doesn't matter.  You are the one making the claim that the bible is literally true.  The burden of proof is on you to prove it, not on me to disprove it. Given the thousands of different creation myths, moral systems and ""bibles"" that have existed since the beginning of the human race, it is incumbent upon you to prove that yours is fact while all others are/were fiction.  Of course, since your beliefs are faith-based not evidence-based, I'm not sure why you would even want to ""prove"" the validity of yours by presenting evidence.  Proving it with objective evidence, even if you could do so, would turn your faith into science.  Sorry to be so wordy.  But I'm as passionate about my beliefs as I assume you are about yours.

Scriptural Viewpoint: Sodom was a lush beautiful region of land whose inhabitants had known the goodness of God. Despite their exposure to, experience with, and witness of the one true loving Creator, the people of Sodom had rejected a relationship with God, and turned to numerous types of idolatry. When God's messengers were sent to the city, the men of Sodom responded by threatening the ultimate act of violent abuse,   murder  , disrespect and humiliation. They were going to RAPE God's representatives. All other Old and New Testament references to Sodom involved the sins of idolatry, inhospitality, indifference toward the poor and the rejection of God's messengers. There are NO REFERENCES to same sex acts or HOMOSEXUALITY. The story of Sodom had nothing to do with homosexuality.====================CORINTHIANS ====================This passage virtually shows how many twist and change God's words to spread hate.I Corinthians 6:9-11Let us examine that very closely.Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate [malakoi], nor   homosexual   offenders [arsenokoites], nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God.First of all, before we address this line, let us consider one thing. Supposedly taken from a 2000+ year old book, understand that the word ""homosexual"" was not coined until 1869 by Austrian-born novelist Karl-Maria Kertbeny. So how it happens to be included in a true reading of the particular biblical passage should make you ponder how accurate the interpretation actually is. So man changing the words of the Bible to conveniently spread hate? I think so.Now onto the interpretation, i've included the original Greek words as well where it's relevant.Paul was attempting to educate the new Christians in Corinth as to what Godly living was all about. In verses 9-10, he listed ways of living that were not compatible with a Christ-centered life. In verse 11, Paul reminded them that they had been saved out of those destructive ways. There are two Greek words in I Corinthians 6:9, which sometimes are translated with a homosexual connotation. First word, ""malakoi"" or ""malakos"" - it literally means soft or mushy; it can mean spineless, wishy-washy or without backbone. ""Malakoi"" was used four other times in the New Testament and it always meant ""soft."" The context of I Corinthians seems to imply a moral softness or decadence, a failure to stand up for what is right and godly. It is significant that for several hundred years there was no sexual connotation assigned to this word. Second word, ""arsenokoitai"" or ""arsenokoites"" - it literally means, ""males having sex."" Early commentaries on I Corinthians related ""arsenokoitai"" to male temple prostitutes and to men having sex with boys. (Idolatrous prostitution and pedophilia are always wrong for those seeking to honor God.) Homosexual relationships were known in the Greco-Roman culture of Paul's day. The Greek word commonly used in reference to adult male same sex partners was ""arrenokoites."" Paul did not use this word. Instead, he created his own, ""arsenokoitai."" If Paul had intended to condemn all adult male same sex partners, he would have used the common word for it. "	FAVOR

Churches should have the absolute right to determine who is or is not eligible to receive any of their sacraments or blessings, and may discriminate at will based upon whatever criteria they set for themselves, but government has no such leeway.  If heterosexuals continue to want their government to acknowledge their marriages and dispense rights and protections based upon those marriages, then such acknowledgement must be open and available to ALL citizens, regardless of sexual orientation.The fact that we currently have a situation in which sacramental blessings of marriage and governmental verification of civil marriage are dispensed at the same moment by the same officiant, should in no way cause us to confuse the two separate and distinct institutions.  If we need to rename one of these institutions ""civil unions"" and provide such civil unions to all couples who seek governmental acknowledgment of their relationships, regardless of the gender of the participants, and leave the other term, ""marriage"" as a purely religious concept to be granted at will by various religious institutions, then so be it.  It would probably be easier, on the whole, though, for us all to just grow up and realize that the two institutions exist side-by-side and, while we may be able to control the one (sacramental), there is no good reason to deny the other (civil) to any of our fellow citizens based upon our personal religious beliefs."

1106	gayRights	"MY RESPONSE: (Durnit, I wish they had block-quoting on here...) Yes, I do believe there is a ""gay gene,"" or rather, a series of recessive genes which must all be present in some combination in order to produce an exclusively homosexual individual.  You bring up the example of someone who is left-handed.  Left-handedness is not controlled by one single gene, but there is little denial that it IS a genetically-linked trait.  Additionally, the world (despite your freshman biology lesson on dichotomous keys) is not divided up into ""Right-handed People"" and ""Left-handed People.""  You certainly must be aware that some people are ambidextrous?  And there is considerable scientific research available into how the brains of such people work -- which areas light up and which do not during a variety of activities involving certain types of thought and the use of one or both hands.  Even your example of the person affected by male-pattern baldness is not nearly so clear cut as you make it sound.  Some people with male-pattern baldness become completely bald in a very short time, while others retain most of their hair for many years.  Some thin only a little in the front.  Others start with a large bare circle at the crown.  Genetics are not nearly as simplistic as our high school studies of ""dominant brown eyes"" and ""recessive blue eyes"" taught us to believe.  Genes can work in combination with other genes in complex interactions in which the failure of one single gene to properly ""turn on"" can lead the the failure of the entire process.Some genes are more fragile than others, as well.  While most genes replicate perfectly, time after time, division after division, yet there are some which tend to malfunction or mis-replicate quite frequently, leading to common genetic mutation disorders such as ""Fragile X.""It is likely that the ""gay genes"" may include some which are highly sensitive to subtle changes in the intrauterine environment.  This would go a long way towards explaining why, while monozygotic twins have a greatly increased likelihood of sharing the same sexual orientation as compared with dizygotic twins, still the co-incidence is not 100%.While I do not necessarily believe that Kinsey is the be-all and end-all expert on human sexuality, I do agree with many of his thoughts, including his view of a ""spectrum"" of sexual orientation.  As I've pointed out here, there is nothing in my model which is inconsistent with a spectrum.  Just as left-handedness is accepted as a genetically-linked trait, but is, itself, a point on a spectrum of hand-dominance, so, in all likelihood, is sexual orientation.  Nor is there anything about characteristics being genetically-linked which would deny the possibility that they could also fall within a spectrum.MARTIN: ""Can I ask you this: do you agree that sexuality develops out of a complex web of biological and environmental factors? If so, then can you really respond ""YES"" to the question of whether or not people are born gay?""MY RESPONSE: Yes, I do.  But there is nothing about that viewpoint which contradicts the idea that people are ""born gay.""  I believe that the environmental factors which assist in determining sexual orientation are intrauterine -- hormonal fluctuations, for instance.  Studies have shown that the more older biological brothers from the same mother a man has, whether or not they are raised together, the higher his likelihood of being gay.  The mechanism is thought to be an increased sensitization of the mother's immune response to the presence of a male fetus, similar to the effects of maternal (Rh-) exposure to first and subsequent pregnancies with Rh+ fetuses.  So, yes, whether being gay is 100% genetic (unlikely) or involves some environmental (probably intrauterine) influences upon the fetus' early development, I do believe that people are born gay (or straight, or somewhere along the continuum between the two, as determined by their specific genetic makeup and any environmental influences which have been exerted upon that genetic makeup) and that this sexual orientation is immutable.

In fact a large majority of the earth's population thought that the earth was flat, and the majority of the U.S. thought slavery was alright and used Bible verses to support their position.If all your going to argue is: well most of these religions think this so it must be right, then I don't see the point in continuing. Your argument isn't valid. You also never tell me how, specifically it hurts society. They're not forcing those people who think it's immoral to be homosexual, or even to condone homosexuality. Homosexuals are merely looking for their own rights.3) Thanks for providing proof that you are using multiple accounts.	FAVOR
1109	gayRights	"If someone such as the expert can choose to be straight in the sense that they chose to work on it and they changed why are they wrong to consider that people are not born gay or have a choice? Why do you assume that the expert's experience is illegitimate and just something like a choice to be monogamous?I know this relates also to the GAYDAR section but this topic is getting discussed and it ties in. I once had a customer who talked incessantly for a long period of time telling me how they didn't like talking to people and how people react etc. It seemed strange to me as they seemed to love to talk. Just before leaving they commented ""You are gay aren't you?"" I said ""no"". He was floored and left in silence. I then realized what he meant was that he don't like (talking to) straight people. That is just an example of what I have experienced. There does seem to be such a thing as a GAYDAR and I never could figure why I set it off among gay men. I didn't take too much interest for much of my life and advances that can result from setting off the GAYDAR I found flattering. Since the hormones kicked in I have never been sexually attracted to men so it did seem strange.Then I became a Christian. As a Christian you can't ignore agressive gay activists continually attacking your religion and screaming that a belief that God considers homosexual behaviour a sin is just an outlet of ugly discrimination against someone who was born that way. So I read up on the topic. What I found was the characteristic features of boys who grow up gay were exhibited by me as a child. Hell I even got teased with some very unflattering synonyms. It also reminded me of a massive change that I experienced around puberty which I attributed at the time to hormones and didn't give another thought to. I now believe I was wrong. Gay men had the same hormones and they stay on the same course. It provided the discovery that coincidental aspects of my environment just before I changed are the same things which psychotherapists consider gay boys are lacking. Certain experiences suddenly seemed significant. I didn't complete puberty with same sex attractions so there was no apparent issue. The sexual cravings from puberty found me a heterosexual. Although I do admit that right at the beginning I looked at a naked female photograph and thought to myself ""How will I get sexually aroused by that?"" and did wonder if I might be gay. The solution to those questions occurred naturally without any need for anything. When I became old enough I experienced heterosexual attraction and never looked back. The only vestige of that aspect of my life is being picked up on gay men's GAYDAR and a pretty effective GAYDAR of my own. Interestingly alot changed about me when I changed so heterosexual men not being as attuned to the subtleties don't ever think of me like that.Yep I'm a Christian so if I was gay now I'd want to change. But from what I've experienced and from what I've read I find the born that way argument very non-compelling and the expertise of people who assist people to change extremely compelling. I am extremely confident that the experience of the expert is legitimate. You can't discipline your sexual preference. He would have spontaneously developed a heterosexual orientation after deliberately tweaking his environment just like we spontaneously developed a heterosexual orientation due to our environment albeit in my case with a lot of luck.I also note that if my 'change' had occurred a few years later gay activists would have already insisted that I should come out and that I was born that way with an immutable sexuality. Personally I feel lucky that I wasn't in a position to buy into that bunk. How could someone forced into that type of belief change?"	AGAINST

1111	gayRights	Romans 1:24 - Therefore God gave them up in the lust of their hearts to impurity, to the degrading of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the TRUTH of God for a LIE and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed.  For this reason God gave them up to degrading passions.  Their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural, and in the same way also men, giving up natural intercourse with women, were consumed with passion for one another.  Men committed shameless acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for their error.  This is an unnatural lifesytle.. and it states that they exchanged the truth for a lie.

1112	gayRights	"I most certainly can and do argue that...1.) Rational [truth is] objective and spiritual truth is subjective2.) Objective truth is higher than subjective truth3.) Rational truth is higher than spiritual truthA belief is objective if it conforms to the facts of reality independent of how anyone interprets it.  Like it or not, reality is what it is regardless of what you and I and any one else thinks about it.  The key for humans is to use our senses to gather evidence about reality, and to use our rational minds to interpret that evidence and act upon it.  Francis Bacon said, ""In order to control nature, you must first obey it""  (That may be a paraphrase).  This means, among other things, that you can't change the nature of reality simply by interpreting it to your liking, or denying the facts, or praying real hard for miracles.  Reality is.  Our minds simply do their best to understand it and act accordingly.  In contrast, spiritual truth as you call it is entirely subjective and has no basis whatever in the real world.  I don't see why you would argue with this assertion. As a man a faith you should agree that there is no proof for your belief in christ or even god.  The nature of faith, of which I assume you are proud, is belief WITHOUT evidence.  The fact that we make mistakes doesn't change any of this.  You are trying to argue that our fallibility as humans makes infallible faith necessary as a guard against our emotionalism, our occasional irrationality, and our inevitable errors.  Wrong.  Our numerous faiths are just as flawed as anything that humans do, you just deny it by claiming that god himself wrote your moral laws.  He did not.  Fallible people did, and fallible people like you interpret them and reinterpret them until they get the answers they want.  Everything that humans do is flawed. But with my system, the flaws can be discovered and fixed through reason.  With your system they are attributed to god and become the law for everyone no matter how ridiculous.  The problem is that belief-without-evidence leads to total subjectivity.  If you reject reality and the human perception thereof as the final standard for truth, then anything goes. Everyone can believe anything they want regardless of its incompatibility with the facts of objective reality.  And this is exactly what we see around the world.  Different religious faiths clash violently because they can't clash rationally through discourse.  When there is no objective evidence to present in support of your religious, faith-based views, all thats left to do with those who disagree is kill them.  So it has been for 5000 years (more probably).  The one truth is objective reality.  If we all accepted that, it would go a long way towards ending hate an violence in the world.  In contrast, purely subjective faith releases our worst demons (metaphorically) and gives them free reign. You say ""Even many of the central principles of American constitutional government are founded in Judeo-Christian principles because these principles were thought of as special revelation, truth give to man from God that is superior to any form of truth gained through rational thought.""  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Christian morality is the EXACT OPPOSITE of the US Constitution.  Christian morality is based on doing the will of god.  Obeying god is good, disobeying is bad.  The ten commandments are a list of things that we CANNOT do. The Constitution, in contrast, is based on respect for the rights of the individual human being, not on the will of any god.  The Constitution is a list of things that CANNOT BE DONE TO US.  The Constitution has the Bill of Rights, the ten commandments are the Bill of Wrongs.  The fact that these two diametrically opposed moral systems frequently draw the same the conclusions (e.g. that murder is wrong) does not change the fact that they do so for entirely different reasons.  To me murder is wrong because it violates the humanity of the victim.  To you its wrong because it violates god regardless of the victim. In short, you can't reject rationalism because humans make mistakes and then accept without question (i.e. on faith) whatever the bible says just because you believe that it's the infallible word of god.  There is no rational basis for you to believe that.  It's just your claim, and it flies in the face of overwhelming evidence against it.  And criticizing my system for being imperfect (which it is) doesn't make yours any better or more reasonable.  It just makes it more dangerous.  Sid "	FAVOR
1113	gayRights	Homosexuality is not a   sin   according to the Bible. Any educated Christian would know that. Scholars who have studied the Bible in context of the times and in relation to other passages have shown those passages (Leviticus, Corinthians, Romans, etc) have nothing to do with   homosexuality  . These passages often cherry-picked while ignoring the rest of the Bible. The sins theses passages are referring to are idolatry, prostitution, and rape, not homosexuality.                     /Thats why Jesus never mentions it as well. There is nothing immoral, wrong, or sinful about being gay. Jesus, however, clearly states he HATES hypocrites. If you preach goodness, then promote hate and twist the words of the Bible, you are a hypocrite, and will be judged and sent to hell. Homosexuals will not go to hell, hypocrites will. This is very similar to the   religious   bigots of the past, where they took Bible passages to condone slavery, keep women down, and used Bible passages to claim blacks as curses who should be enslaved by the white man.

1121	gayRights	"The sacrament of marriage is the exact reason why the laws concerning marriage were created.  We wouldn't have ""marriage"" as a concept if it weren't for   religion  .  Society, though, doesn't in fact encourage   children  .  If you look at Western Europe, their birth rates are well below replacement and dangerously close to societal collapse despite their natalist government policies.  The United States is leaning towards those dismal numbers itself.I am first and foremost about children in my opposition to   same-sex marriage  .  We are already seeing vast changes in culture in the states that have adopted same-sex marriage.  These states are shutting down Catholic   adoption   agencies by forcing   the law   (same-sex marriage is   legal  ) to take precedent over their religion in their adoption agencies.  Same-sex marriage starts to trample   religious freedom   even if it is ""only"" a legal issue.The other major cultural shift is in that a school can no longer (and religious institutions lest they violate ""hate laws"" or discriminate) hold up traditional opposite-sex marriage as the normal, optimal solution to a child.  Confusing children at an early age as to whether they should marry a boy or a girl is not good for children still in the development stages.  Claiming that it doesn't matter whether a child marries a boy or a girl is equivalent to   society   saying that girls are the SAME as boys.  This is patently false... men and women are EQUAL, but NOT the same.I agree that societal and attitude changes are required about marriage.  Our out-of-wedlock birthrate in the US is staggering, and the statistics about children raised in single parent households are appalling.  That being said, legalizing, and therefore societal endorsing, same-sex marriage says that our society doesn't care that a child has a mother and father.  We have taken that option off the table.  Adoption agencies are not allowed to discriminate and favor a married opposite-sex couple over a same-sex one anymore, which deprives children of a mother and father.  A same-sex couple is obviously a wonderful option for a child that is in foster care or in dire straights, but society needs to be able to favor an opposite-sex couple over a same-sex one in adoption.  A child has a right to a mother and father when it is possible.Additionally, the whole notion that it is ""discrimination"" is ridiculous, no offense.  Same-sex marriage is a NEW right.  Everyone has the right to marry someone of the opposite sex.  I will inevitably hear the rebuttal of how inter-racial marriages were illegal, and that is a non sequitur.  There is no difference between the races, but there are staggering differences between men and women.  Everyone has the right to marry someone of the opposite sex, but some individuals are predisposed towards someone of their sex, be it by genetics, nurture, or nature or some combination.By redefining marriage, we have not only thrown the notion that men and women are different out the window, we have necessarily changed that definition to allow anyone to marry anyone if it is consensual.  There is no reason, therefore, that three people cannot marry into a polygamous relationship if it is about consensual decisions between any persons.  There is a reason that thousands of years of human history have evolved to this point; that marriage is between a man and a woman, and that reason is being torn down.I have the utmost compassion for gays and their situation, but that does not mean I forsake my standards and ignore the consequences of such a change because of my emotional ""compassion.""Thanks for the discussion."

1127	gayRights	Well said. Too often Christians make homosexual behavior the unforgivable sin. It is not.However, that being said, it is still a sin. The line between law and grace is a tough one to walk, but we must do that nonetheless. There simply are no Scriptural references to homosexuality in a positive light. And the Church has always taught (for nearly 2000 years now) that it is a sin. It is only in our highly sexualized and self-indulgent culture that some people have sought to question that view.Thank you for posting an honest, grace-filled article.

The way it is presently setup the government also deals with divorce, but a divorce case could not be settled in court if the marriage was never considered to be legal or at least something that can be considered legal, however I don't mean to convey that it would make it illegal, just that it wouldn't be covered in our laws anymore.  Oh! and another thing is for those who are atheists or simply don't choose to go to church how would that work?

Here's just what a 5 minute search brings:    ;109/2/341?fulltext=&searchid=QID_NOT_SETA growing body of scientific literature demonstrates that children who grow up with 1 or 2 gay and/or lesbian parents fare as well in emotional, cognitive, social, and sexual functioning as do children whose parents are heterosexual. ChildrenÕs optimal development seems to be influenced more by the nature of the relationships and interactions within the family unit than by the particular structural form it takes.    Organizations that have officially supported adoption by same-sex couples include the American Psychological Association, the Child Welfare League of America, the American Bar Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the North American Council on Adoptable Children, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychoanalytic Association, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.    Fears about children of lesbian or gay parents being sexually abused by adults, ostracized by peers, or isolated in single-sex lesbian or gay communities have received no scientific support. Overall, results of research suggest that the development, adjustment, and well-being of children with lesbian and gay parents do not differ markedly from that of children with heterosexual parents.

1130	gayRights	It is not proven by any means that sexual orientation is mutable.  Just because some people are bisexual does not prove that any and every person could change his/her innate sexual orientation.  Clearly, the physical capability exists for most people to interact sexually with a person of either gender, but that does not equate to a basic orientation of bisexuality.  Most people are FAR more attracted, physically and emotionally, to the opposite gender than to their own gender.  They cannot wilfully change this orientation to force themselves to feel the same degree (or even close) of attraction towards persons of their own gender.  In the same way, a smaller segment of the population is FAR more attracted, physically and emotionally, to people of the same gender, and  cannot wilfully change this orientation to force themselves to feel the same degree (or even close) of attraction towards persons of the opposite gender.

Many people today continue to have secular marriages.However, once the state started recognizing marriages, then things like tax breaks, parental rights, hospital visitation rights, judicial protections, etc became legal benefits.

Hypothetically speaking, what if homosexuality IS evil? So what? I don't believe that myself but if you do, how does it really affect you? (not you Sid)My personal opinion is that so many things like this, both religious in nature and not, is really fueled by fear of the unknown and a lack of confidence.For example, if you are strong in your Christian faith, what do you have to lose by gaining a better understating of Islam or Buddhism?  I have traveled extensively all over the world and with each journey, I gain a greater understanding of the world and it's people but traveling abroad only enhances my love for my country.  It doesn't make me want to move there.I believe there is fear behind homophobia for most people. If you are secure in who you are, what does it matter?

Yes I do.""You never came to respond to my critique; your concept that rational truth is objective and spiritual-religious truth is not and that thus rational truth is more correct is an assumption.  You even concur that it is subjective but respond not by defending its objectivity but continuing to reinforce the idea of the apparent subjectivity of spiritual truth.  In this case, for the purposes of argument, it can be said that both rational and spiritual truth are subjective and there is not basis to argue that rational truth is higher or more true because it also falls to the realm of subjectivity.  You cannot argue...1.) Rational objective and spiritual truth is subjective2.) Objective truth is higher than subjective truth3.) Rational truth is higher than spiritual truthwhen you concur that rational truth is not objective, the logic fails.  Essentially when you answer ""Yes I do"" assume, you are begging the question.  You are assuming the thing to which you are trying to prove.  Furthermore, you assume that human beings are excellent rational beings.  A capacity for rationality does not guarantee rational excellency.  In reality most people are irrational and base choices off of not what one would could call rational and logical reasoning but on emotive  persuasions and fanciful constructions that care less with the matter of fact, as is, and more with the matter of desire, what is wanted from their self.  The idea then, that people are primarily rational is also unfounded.  Following, leaving morality to the tending of human rational thought alone is foolish.  It lacks good sense and sound judgment.  It is of no coincidence that the founders of our nation invoked divine aid in much of the process of the framing of the constitution among a great many things.  Congress opens in prayer with purpose.  Even many of the central principles of American constitutional government are founded in Judeo-Christian principles because these principles were thought of as special revelation, truth give to man from God that is superior to any form of truth gained through rational thought.  Even the Enlightenment thought of Descartes only justified the veracity of sensory evidence from which rational thought can deduct from because God guarantees the truthfulness of certain perceptions.  Without this guarantee there is not trust that anything we perceive has any basis in actual, objective reality.  The wise choice is not to leave moral truth to the realm of human rational alone.

1154	gayRights	Before we can determine what scripture means for us today, we must understand what it meant for the people to whom it was originally given back then. In plainer words, what scripture means today is limited by what it meant back then.Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN.Whatever meaning we assign to Paul's words has to have been a probable understanding in the first century.There are three areas which help us understand what Paul meant back then.1. The historical context. First century Rome was an idolatrous culture with hundreds of temples to pagan gods and goddesses. One fertility goddess in particular was Cybele, known as the Protectress of Rome.        2. The religious context. The most prominent goddess figure in first century Rome was Cybele, the Phrygian fertility goddess. Five worship sites honored her in Rome at the time Paul wrote Romans.Roman coins bearing Cybele's likeness were inscribed with the words, Mater Deum, Mother of the gods.Cybele was worshiped by castrated Galli priests who offered themselves sexually to male worshipers.This is what Paul describes in Romans 1, citing the Old Testament experience of Jews who had rebelled against God and practiced fertility goddess worship.3. The way Christians back then understood Paul's words in Romans 1.Aristides, preaching before the Roman Emperor Hadrian, AD 126, linked Paul's words in Romans 1 to shrine prostitution.Justin Martyr, preaching around AD 150, linked Paul's words in Romans 1 to shrine prostitution.        To read Romans 1 today and say scripture is condemning a committed, faithful, non-cultic lesbian or gay partnership is to give the text a new meaning which was unknown to the original readers.And if it was unknown to the original readers, then that interpretation cannot be true because:Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN.

Different parents are going to be different no matter their gender. Nurturing doesn't necessarily come from the mother and discipline from the father. Also, say the parents are both men, the children aren't going to be secluded from women in their life.

1164	gayRights	"To get at the original intent of why the Bible appears to condemn homosexuality, we must take a dive into the Middle Ages.According to William N. Eskridge, Jr. (writing under the Virginia Law Review), ""The early church fathers Ð most notably Clement, Jerome, Origen, and Augustine Ð developed a philosophy of sexual abstinency that problematized any sexual activity done for pleasure itself.  But other, non-Christian traditions in Roman society Ð Stoicism, Neo-Platonism, Manicheanism Ð similarly urged that 'intercourse was supposed to take place only so as to produce children.  The couple must not make love for the sake of pleasure alone.'""The last sentence is crucial, here.  The couple must not make love for the sake of pleasure alone.  Why?  Because it is selfish and serves no productive purpose for society.  The ideas behind homosexual acts being a sin are the same as heterosexual acts with contraceptives being a sin, or the same as masturbation being a sin.  Pure, selfish pleasure is bad because it is unproductive and turns the focus from helping society to helping one's self.When the Bible condemns homosexuality, it condemns selfishness.  Homosexual love isn't selfish.  Homosexual love is no different from heterosexual love.  Homosexual love represents devotion, affection, trust, respect, all of the same ideals that heterosexual love represents.  True homosexual love is selfless.Don't hate homosexuality.  Hate selfish acts."	FAVOR
1165	gayRights	Good points, Christine.   I think people usually narrow their focus on only what affects them the most.  It's a fact of human psychology that people most often condemn the things in themselves that they find most hard to accept.  Most homophobic people are either fearful of some of the feelings of affection for the same gender, which upsets or confuses them, or they're closeted and can't face it.  So they find whatever they can, wherever they can, to somehow counter the confusion.  Literature like the Bible gives people ample material to quote in order to deal with their own problems.  They are attacking what they dislike the most in themselves, and looking for the best ammunition they can find.Of course, every time I say this to a homophobe, they get outraged and defensive...which is also explained in basic psychology texts.  That's why you'll never win an argument with a religious fundamentalist about a subject like this...not until they accept themselves and their feelings.  I have to admit that although I find their views offensive, I do feel sorry for the conflict that goes on inside them.	FAVOR

I mean, we've adapted so much as humans- all different cultures- we wouldn't have   technology   if we had maintained that mindset.I also have deep rooted Christian beliefs- I'm 22, saving for   marriage  , (though I refuse to marry until everyone in my country is granted that right- guess I'll be a virgin for a long time, hahaha) and I have a lot of strong Christian beliefs- however, bagpiper2005, I agree that my personal beliefs should not prohibit anyone from loving whoever makes them happy- and marriage may be somewhat of a farce as of late (Celebrities are making marriage into a fad, it seems, what with the constant divorce rates and all that lovely jazz), but when I think of 'marriage' I think of happy people committing to loving one another for the rest of their lives- and the prospect of this right being denied to anyone makes me scoff.When I was 12 years old, and a goody-two shoes Christian freak, and I was first presented with the prospect of homosexual marriage (by my super religious aunt) I was so puzzled and confused by the contradictory feelings I had regarding the topic- knowing that, per my aunt, 'and the   bible  - supposedly' God doesn't love 'fags' yet God is a God of love- yeah, you can see where my brain just exploded for a while, there...So all the Fundamentalist Christian hubbub- regardless of the 'grounded evidence' presented in the bible- is just mind-blowingly asinine- even a twelve year old can see it."

It is alleged to be a story condemning homosexuality in the strongest fashion possible. If homosexuality is wrong, we would expect the Bible to say so in some of the 48 places where Sodom is mentioned in the Bible. Instead, we discover that wherever Sodom is mentioned in the Bible, homosexuality is not mentioned or condemned.      If I cited Genesis 34 (a passage about heterosexual rape) as a proof text against heterosexuality, you would contend that its wrong to take a passage about rape and based on that passage, condemn heterosexuality.Yet Exodus and most anti-gay Christians feel no remorse in using a passage about attempted violent rape as a proof text that homosexuality is wrong.In the Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 portion of the Holiness Code, God carefully places His proscription of male male sex in the context of pagan worship, Lev 18:3, taking care to mention Molech in Lev 18:21, just before prohibiting male male sex in Lev 18:22.In the Leviticus 20:13 passage, we find the same context. God carefully mentions and forbids Molech worship in Lev 20:2, 3, 4, 5 and then prohibits male male sex in Lev 20:13 and then reiterates the pagan worship context in Lev 20:23.      *******************************I wonder then, what informs your ""belief and conviction"" that the Bible speaks against homosexuality, even ""committed and faithful"" relationships? How did you get convicted to believe something the Bible does not say?*******************************You asked, Where does God approve of homosexuality in the Bible?I believe God approves of committed, faithful, non-cultic, same sex partnerships in the true story of the 15 year committed relationship Jonathan and David enjoyed, I Samuel 18 - II Samuel 9.Of course most scriptures about marriage partnerships deal with the 95% norm. For the other 5%, exclusive, same sex marriage partnerships between two men or two women were NOT the norm in Biblical times. Therefore, there was no reason to address the issue of gay marriage in the Bible, just as there was no reason to address the issue of nuclear energy back then. six11 wrote:""if GOD 'made people gay' and allowed them to be gay... HE would have spoken about such relationships in the Bible - positively""Okay. Please carefully read Matthew 19:11-12.

He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.ÓJesus does speak positively about ""born eunuchs."" A ""born eunuch"" is someone who was born without the desire for opposite sex marriage in the Adam and Eve model and Jesus specifically exempts ""born eunuchs"" from the Adam and Eve marriage paradigm.The leading anti-gay evangelical, Dr. Robert Gagnon, admits that:""Probably ""born eunuchs"" in the ancient world did include people homosexually inclined...""

1195	gayRights	I think gays give up too much when they use the genetic argument to deflect moral judgments of their lifestyle. Obviously, being gay isn't like deciding to eat ice cream. It arises out of a complex array of choices made as one grows up. It would be silly to claim that everything we like in life is the result of our DNA, and this applies to sexual preference as well. It's equally silly to claim that homosexuality is immoral because it's not 'natural', especially if what's natural is based on animal behavior. We're humans. How much of what we do is natural by that standard? Is kissing natural?  My verdict would be that homosexuality is neither genetic nor immoral. It's one way for humans to live. There is a great deal of self destructive behavior that both homosexuals and heterosexuals indulge in with regard to their sex lives. That kind of behavior is wrong, but the preference itself is not. 	AGAINST

Consider that every single asexual worker ant you see has had an unbroken chain of reproducing ancestors for hundreds of years. Every single one is the offspring of a queen and a mate, yet lives its life without ever having sex. How is that selected for?Some studies suggest that you're more likely to be gay if you have more older brothers. (     / ). This would suggest that your mother carries the genes to make you a gay man. How does she benefit genetically? Consider you have four reproducing brothers, each one impregnates a seperate girl who takes nine months to come to term. Who are you going to impregnate? Better for the family if, like ants, you assist in maintaining your nieces and nephews health until breeding age rather than fruitlessly competing with your siblings.Given the fruit fly studies I would not be surprised if there is a gay gene, however I would also not be surprised if this is an issue of hormonal balance in gestation. I would also believe that in some instances gayness can be environmental. It really doesn't matter one way or another to me but I do believe that at least some, probably most, gays are born homosexual (for valid biological reasons) and should be allowed to live their life however they please. From a purely selfish viewpoint, more gay men means more choice of partner for me and less competition for them. In fact I may start a campaign of straight men for gays!

In ""Children of Lesbian and Gay Parents,"" a 1992 article in Child Development, Charlotte Patterson states, ""Despite dire predictions about children based on well-known theories of psychosocial development, and despite the accumulation of a substantial body of research investigating these issues, not a single study has found children of gay or lesbian parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents.""Psychiatrist Laurintine Fromm, of the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital, agrees with that finding. ""[The] literature...does not indicate that these children fare any worse [than those of heterosexual parents] in any area of psychological development or sexual identity formation.

Besides, I did say that the children from homes with same sex parents will grow up and become very good citizens. But that's not the point. Just like the kids growing up in certain areas like East LA, Compton etc are at a disadvantage but can grow up to become the president of the united states. But the disadvantage is still there and those kids will either have to work harder to learn what is a given to the kids with opposite sex parents or they may never get to know certain realities until they get married to the opposite sex and discover a whole new world.Another point many of us forget is that science is not everything. When it comes to emotions of a human being, or the behavior of a child science has a long way to go. There are 1000s of therapists trying to help people but they admit that help comes from within, therapists (who could be the scientist in this case) ca only give opinions. no facts involved. This is not Math or Physics, it's feelings. Finally as a father I know facts about my children that no doctor, psychiatrist or scientist could tell me.

Not because environments of any size where there are no homosexuals (they are everywhere) but because our environment is a powerful factor in learning racism or homophobia.   You imply that thought and behavior is learned, with which I agree and find hopeful because this means racism and homophobia can also be unlearned, usually by positive interactions with known members of a minority group.   >>A homosexual does not find heterosexuals as weird because the homosexual has grown up in an environment wherein heterosexuality is ""normal"", the opposite is not true.<<As above, this depends on definition of 'normal' (open social acceptability in the current culture in which a person lives or grew up vs. biologically normal variant existing world wide as long as there have been humans)."

Television shows influnce weak minds. Marriages started breaking up. Fifty years ago DIVORCE was not heard of. I knew no one who was divorced---then the television talk shows started talking about it is better to break up than stay together. Now the divorce rate has gone sky high. Compare the rate from the 1950's till now.Fifty years ago an unmarried teenage pregnate girl was unheard of. None of my friends had a baby out of wedlock. No one in my school was pregnate either. Today the schools are filled with young girls flaunting their   pregnancy  . Now they proudly walk the streets unmarried and unashamed. Why don't we go back and make a study on how our television programs--programs MINDS. These sexual programs give birth to homosexuality--divorce--etc. Study THIS for a while and you will see the change being caused by our television programs. People aren't born gay--this is a MIND thing. Sexual things on public television is the cause of homosexuality rapidly growing in our country. Go ahead--compare the numbers. Research the history of homosexuality population. Research how many homosexual people did our country have in the 50's-60's-70's till now. Then look to see when homosexuality started being broadcasted on television or over the air waves. I guarentee you that THIS started the BIRTHING PROCESS of homosexuality in our country. IT WASN'T AN EGG OR A SPERM THAT CONNECTED TOGETHER TO FORM A BABY that turns out to be a homosexual-- Homosexuals don't have babies to replenish the earth--cause they don't have sex with the opposite sex so the only way they can replenish the earth is by PROGRAMMING ANOTHER PERSON'S MIND--This is what our television programs are doing--They are programming Minds to make a NEW WORLD. Oprah did say the day that she had on the pregnant MAN that they were going to FORM a NEW WORLD. I'll NEVER forget those words. They can only make a NEW WORLD by  programming our young childrens MINDS threw their highly watched television shows. I say take all sexual programs off of our public television stations--bring back good wholesome family shows and slowly watch the homosexual rate or population drop. It's all about programming minds.  	AGAINST

1251	gayRights	"Sexual orientation and language are not alike in any way.  They arise from different parts of the brain and in very different ways, both in the individual and in the species.Instinctive sexual behavior has been part of the genetic make-up of the species (and its predecessor species) for millions of years longer than organized complex language (such as English and Swahili).  While most species have innate, instinctive capacities for some form of rudimentary or even relatively complex communication, the aspects of that communication which are instinctive and heritable are generally non-verbal, and are similar across all closely-related members of the species, even those which live in different geographic regions and have no contact with one another.  Humans have similar non-verbal, instinctive behaviors (sexual behaviors, among them).  But, while the capacity for spoken language is heritable (both the mechanical capacity and the mental capacity), the language, itself, is not inherited.Sexual behavior, though, is far more instinctive.  It is the basis of the species' survival (explaining why the majority of individuals in a species will always be primarily heterosexually oriented).  Heterosexual individuals do not LEARN to be heterosexual.  If heterosexual behavior had to be learned, then many, many species would have long since died out from lack of copulation and reproduction, because infants in the majority of species leave their mothers' care at the point when the   mother   is ready to mate again and bear more offspring.  They never have an opportunity to ""learn"" to be heterosexual.  In the same way, our sexual desires and behaviors are not, at their most basic level, learned.  They are instinctive.For a variety of reasons, most probably genetic, some possibly due to intrauterine hormonal fluctuations and exposures, a certain percentage of the human population (like that of most animal species) develops instinctive sexual traits which cause them to be sexually attracted to members of their own gender.This is nothing like language, or learning a new language.  Can someone who is innately heterosexual learn to engage in a homosexual sex act?  Of course they can.  Will this ever be ""natural"" for them?  Will this make them become innately sexually attracted to members of their own gender?  Of course not.  The only people who can readily imagine being attracted to members of either gender are bisexuals.  People who fall at either end of the spectrum of sexual orientation cannot choose to fall in love with the gender to which they are not innately attracted.  Can they learn to have sex with them?  Probably.  But I would hope we can all agree that having loveless, unfulfilling sex with no primary attachment of true attraction, love and devotion is not a good outcome and should not be anyone's goal. You can't learn to fall in love with a gender to which you are not attracted."	FAVOR

Next, you stated in the second paragraph,Ó Now parenthood has many definitions and the ones that go into what I called ""maintenance"" is what I'm directly interested in.ÓMy response:The premise posits that the term parenthood has, Õmany definitionsÕ. It also, propositionally, establishes that the argument is based upon multiple definitions of the same term. (This is a non- discreet way of using the fallacy of ambiguity to argue through to an ambiguous conclusion.) The introduction of ambiguity into a debate is nothing more than an attempt to redefine the key term/s of the debate to prove a predetermined a conclusion. And moreover, the explicit claim that more than one definition will be used for the same term invalidates the entirety of the argument. However, disregarding what your intent may or may not be, I will continue with my rebuttal of the remainder of your argument wherein we disagree.You stated:When adoption is going to take place the progenitor/parent/s of origin are giving up their responsibility of raising and nurturing said child. In that aspect, they give up their rights to parenthood. My response:If what you claim is true then letÕs test the principle of that proposition by application of the principle. The principle: When a man or woman no longer wants to be responsible for that which is theirs, they no longer have rights to that which is theirs. (Lucidly stated for the debate)A. A husband and wife decide they want to get rid of their house; they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the house.B. A husband and wife decide to offer up their car for free; they no longer have a right to choose whom takes the car.C. A husband and wife decide to give up their animal pets; they no longer have a right to choose whom receives the pets.All three examples contradict the reality of the transfer of ownership. Albeit, a thief is more likely to agree with the examples than the common person. For the thief presumes it is now his/her property for the taking.All parents have the natural law of authority of ownership and must first transfer that authority unto another party before another party can rightfully claim the same authority over the respective property whether it is of children, vehicles, houses, or pets. LetÕs move on to the next statement. You claimed: Since this, (to raise or nurture), is the most important aspect to ""parenthood"" then any human possible of possessing a nurturing or raising nature is a possible target to be a parent. My response:Children of the age 2, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9, demonstrate that it is possible for them to possess a nurturing or raising nature; therefore they are possible targets to be parents. Individuals who suffer from diseases of the mind also meet the same criteria. Should they too be allowed to adopt? Pedophiles exactly meet the criteria. Should they be allowed to adopt? The most hardened criminals meet the criteria. Should they be allowed to adopt?The ultimate conclusion, logically deduced from my arguments, is that no man, woman, or institution has authority to determine the recipient of the transfer of authority of that which is not theirs to begin with, including myself. No one in the world has a right to adopt. No institution in the world has a right to adopt. For if we argue that some have a right to adopt then we must reason that they have authority to steal that which belongs to another person.A homosexual has no right to adopt. However, the sister of a homosexual has the authority to transfer authority of her child to her homosexual sibling. No right is necessary. And the friend of the sister has no right to determine the recipient of the authority.Therefore, no gay has a right to adopt. Which is the actual question of the debate."	AGAINST

Fascism is necessarily authoritarian, though it is used interchangeably solely for that aspect in popular culture.  Fascism also includes an economic component, one where the government exerts control over privately help businesses through partial ownership.  This is not the simple complete ownership of industry in Communism, but has the result of government direction of industry in many cases.  Again, this could not have evolved without the concepts of State, corporations, human rights, etc, which have only developed in the last few hundred years.Racism is actually not the idea that a ""tribal group or nation"" is superior to others.  Racism is distinctly about race.  Europeans, for example, are usually of the same race but have been thinking that their tribe was superior to other European tribes for centuries.  Only since the human ability to circumnavigate the globe and come into contact with distinct races of people has the concept of   racism   evolved to where it is today.  The idea that one tribe is superior to another BECAUSE of the race could not have evolved when individuals never ran into individuals of separate races on a regular basis.Again, you point out some of the moral progress we have made along with our material progress, but as I have shown, a lot of moral ideas have come along that are NOT progress.  This Marxian idea of ""Progress,"" which so many individuals exhibit an almost religious faith in, is dangerous for humanity.

1284	gayRights	And this book:As Nature Made Him : The Boy Who Was Raised as A GirlAuthor: John Colapinto In 1967, after a baby boy suffered a botched   circumcision  , his family agreed to a radical treatment. On the advice of a renowned expert in gender identity and sexual reassignment at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the boy was surgically altered to live as a girl. This landmark case, initially reported to be a complete success, seemed all the more remarkable since the child had been born an identical twin: his uninjured brother, raised as a boy, provided to the experiment the perfect matched control.The so-called twins case would become one of the most famous in modern   medicine   and the social sciences; cited repeatedly over the past thirty years as living proof that our sense of being male or female is not inborn but primarily the result of how we are raised. A touchstone for the feminist movement, the case also set the precedent for sex reassignment as standard treatment for thousands of newborns with similarly injured, or irregular, genitals.But the case was a failure from the outset. From the start the famous twin had, in fact, struggled against his imposed girlhood. Since age fourteen, when finally informed of his medical history, he made the decision to live as a male. John Colapinto tells this extraordinary story for the first time in As Nature Made Him. Writing with uncommon intelligence, insight, and compassion, he also sets the historical and medical context for the case, exposing the thirty-year-long scientific feud between Dr. John Money and his fellow sex researcher, Dr. Milton Diamond--a rivalry over the nature/nurture debate whose very bitterness finally brought the truth to light.

1286	gayRights	Nope! What's wrong about homosexuality? I think that it is a personal choice.Marriage is about union of two souls, not two genders. As long as the couples love each other, no matter they are a gay or a lesbian, they do have their rights to get married, no one should have stop them. Although homosexuals can't reproduce, they could adopt those homeless children as their child.The reason why some people who think that homosexuality is morally wrong is because it is against their religion but do they ever think about others? Must others gonna be same as them. No one has the rights to force others to do things because in this 21st century, everyone do have their freedom!	FAVOR

They're probably very alike in at least some ways, physically, in personality, or in the traits they pass on to their kids, because they have the same genetic source: the parents. Now imagine that a gay or lesbian person was in a primitive family many thousand years ago. They wouldn't have their own kids, but that would free the person up to help watch out for their sibling's kids. They'd also be useful on hunting or gathering trips, because they could do just as much work as anyone else, but they wouldn't take as big a share for their family. We can actually see this in the black-backed jackal. Often, an adult pup will come back and help raise the next litter. Does that jackal spread its genes that year? No. Does it help spread its family's? Yep. Did black-backed jackals who did have the gene outspread those who didn't, making this a common trait among all jackals? Yep.

It made me rethink the issue, so I'll provide a few answers to your questions and then reframe the issue.2)     / - Sadly, the Catholic agency had to choose between their beliefs and   law  . The State, which mandated that same-sex marriages were equal to traditional marriages, made it impossible to differentiate legally.4) As you can see, codifying   same-sex marriage   as equal in law DOES force your beliefs on others.  Either the Catholic   adoption   agency agrees with same-sex marriage, or it must close down.  If that is not coercion, I don't know what is.Now for a little reframing.  My hope is that you would attempt to see the issue from the opposite side, although I am a little discouraged that you think it is my responsibility to prove ""when I have demonstrated compassion for homosexuals.""  My hope is that, as an informed women who cares about the issue enough to debate someone on a site like this, you would research these issues. I encourage you to read up on many of the religious issues surrounding same-sex marriage in Europe and the US, as well as read some intellectual discussions from the pro-traditional marriage side. I certainly am not the most eloquent spokesman, but one must first disregard the notion that opponents are either bigots or not progressive in their thinking (and therefor dumb).  You certainly don't get any intellectual debate about the issue in the New York Times or on CNN.The problem with the whole issue is that gays think the marriage issue is all about gays.  It has barely anything to do with gays frankly, and every attempt to change the definition of traditional marriage in American   society   is met with the same attempt to stop it.  The issue is that marriage, as defined as the union between one man and one woman, should be kept that way for the good of society.  Utah wasn't allowed into the Union until it changed its incorrect definition of marriage to that of the United States.Do you think that marriage between one man and one woman, especially in regards to the raising of   children  , is the ideal for society?  Does it make no difference if a child has two mothers instead of a mother and a father?Ignoring the difference between the sexes is required to disregard this ideal. Thinking that a male and a female parent in a loving married relationship do not bring something different to the table than two loving gay parents is just untrue.The point is that traditional-marriage advocates are arguing FOR the ideal of opposite-sex marriage for the betterment of society, and not against any group in particular.It most certainly is not a discrimination issue for gays, even though it is constantly touted as one.  There is no difference between a caucasian man and an asian man other than cosmetic difference.  There are huge differences between men and women.  This is why we have girl scouts and boy scouts, but not white scouts and asian scouts.  We should as a society be able to differentiate in our laws regarding different things, and gays currently have the same right to marry someone of the opposite sex as everyone else.  Gays just don't choose to because of their genetic/nature/nurture/biological differences.  Allowing equal rights in visitation, inheritance, etc should obviously be law, and currently it can be law in many cases through contracts between individuals, but where not it should be made so.In order to make it a discrimination issue, therefor, we would have to change the definition of marriage from ""the union of one man and one woman"" to ""the union between individuals who love each other.""  In this case, there is no rational argument one could make against any grouping of consensual, loving humans joining together in a ""marriage,"" including polygamy and intra-family marriage, which is why that definition is not true.I hope this helps, and I appreciate the discussion.  My main goal merely is to at least get others to think a few steps beyond the initial emotionality of the issue.  What's good for individuals on an micro scale is not necessarily good for society.  Thinking past ""stage 1,"" though most people do not, is imperative to understanding any issue.  Thinking about the consequences wrought on children as they are taught in school that there is no ideal for marriage or relationships, about the consequences on men and women as marriage becomes any arrangement one pleases, and denying the differences between the value of men and women in child-rearing can have vast consequences that are unknowable.  Making such a momentous change in society should be thought out, and at least voted on behind a banner a little more well-thought out than ""Prop H8"" or ""Equal Rights."""	AGAINST

1334	gayRights	Not quite true. Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings. In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on. There is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics, but the possibility is a strong one.Here is a video that explains the idea better	FAVOR
1335	gayRights	The Alliance Defense Fund maintains that children without the ÒtraditionalÓ heterosexual parents will ultimately be a harmful influence on these children.  Even though they proclaim all sorts of unbiased evidence exists to support their claim, they make no mention of it and, in this debate, it has become really important to make your Ònon-partisan researchÓ known, and better yet, to quote it, so that your assertions are clear and verifiable.  Lambda Legal, in their objection, quotes their own sources, and provides links to them, and these sources are of an authoritative nature.  Now, to ADFÕs credit, the ADF does paraphrase a source with a name in their response to the objection, but we still have no idea what part of the text they refer to in these sources or how we might even find these sources.  The point is, unnamed sources might as well not exist, and unquoted sources, without any citation or means enabling verification, could very well misinterpret ideas or take them out of context.For the sake of argument, letÕs disregard the alleged science of anyoneÕs claims and use some good Ôole Òcommon senseÓ ADF implores.  Now, psychologists might say that a child develops this way because a mother provides influence A and the father provides influence B, and perhaps we can quantify all such influences on child development, and then perhaps we could construct an ideal situation to raise children in.  But who knows what all the influences and factors and combinations there are, let alone how any treatment or situation might work out?  Is it better to spank or not to spank?  Daycare or no daycare?  Homeschool or no homeschool?  Perhaps there is an answer to every one of these kinds of questions, but you donÕt need me to tell you we have all the answers, and that, if we have sufficient answers, weÕre ready to believe them.  ThatÕs why the government still gives parents a lot of free reign over their children.

1336	gayRights	 Higot-according to mothers book of definitions means a person who practices, by choice, the act of   homosexuality   and then blames everything under the sun for their sexuality to the point of abnormal psychology. The higot feels they are deserving of special treatment by the whole of society because they just do,period. A person who does not see tolerance as something they must exhibit but that all others must abide by these cosmic rules;a sense of distorted reality  aka homosexual bigot=higot. A person who will when they are questioned about their sexual choice will deny the ability to choose or willingness to admit they can change. Despite horrendous mounting evidence to the contrary. They will say they are born this way and have no choice but deny the fact that people like Rock Hodson would be alive today since his first choice was a woman. They will question the authenticity of someones homosexuality if they do anything illegal or immoral ie serial rapist/murderers that are homosexual are not true homosexuals according to them. That is quite interesting given the fact they feel that homosexuality cannot be taught or learned but is a birth condition, without any genetic proof ofcourse. While on the other hand teaching homosexuality to   children   in school. Was removing this from a mental disorder the wisest decision. NO.

1351	gayRights	The problems with your view are manifold.1. Committed, faithful, non-cultic, same sex partnerships are not prohibited in the Old Testament, in Sodom or anywhere else.         What the OT prohibits is shrine prostitution. Therefore there is no prior scriptural basis for Paul to prohibit same sex relationships, except for prohibiting shrine prostitution.        2. Since lesbianism is never condemned in the OT, it is entirely out of context with Paul's argument about idolatry to suddenly inject a one verse condemnation of lesbianism (Romans 1:26) into his idolatry argument.3. Early Christians understood Romans 1:26 as a reference to non-procreative sex as being unnatural. It was hundreds of years later (around AD 330), when John Chrysostom decided Paul might have been referring to lesbians.4. If you'll take the time to read the information at the Links in my previous comment to you, you will discover that early Christians DID understand Romans 1:26-27 as referring to shrine prostitution instead of homosexuality.        5. Scripture cannot mean NOW what it did not mean THEN. If Romans 1:26-27 was a reference to shrine prostitution then, its a reference to shrine prostitution now. That doesn't change simply because someone in the twenty first century decides to take the verses out of their historical context. 	FAVOR

1353	gayRights	 Unions give all the same   legal   rights so the only reason I can see for the homosexual movement to want to invade traditional   marriage   is to destroy it completely along with what they deem as unuseful repressive socialtal relgious  boundaries, which by the way, is the bedrock of a viable, solid and functional and preserved   society  . Just my thoughts. Also if we open the door to allow homosexual marriages which is clearly against Biblical and Christian beliefs then it would only stand to reason we would allow adultresses to have moral and legal rights to their married partners   money  ,   health   plans, property, salaries, retirment, and oh yah wills too right? And then if we give this right to adultresses why not just open it to polygamous marriage, and then to incestous marriage, and then to beastiality marriage and then to heck just get rid of marriage all together. Do you see how damaging allowing homosexual marriage will be? Probably not so instead here is a question from an ex-adultress to all churches and ministers who feel they can either by pass God and condone homosexuality and adultry or either feel they can stay neutral on these moral subjects : have a question for all ministers out there that are marrying homosexual couples.  This question comes from me, and ex-adultress, I would like to know when adultresses will get the stamp of approval from your   church   too, when will this lifestyle be given moral respectablity and legal rights? When will the minister hail the love and devotion of adultresses in this country?I spent years and years caring for a married man, we bought a house together and a car, went on trips etc but I have no rights as an adultress and if you allow homosexual couples to marry, clearly against the word of Gd, I was wondering how long before you drop all the Godly precepts and boundaries set in place by a wise and loving Gd whose desire is to bless traditional marriage, in lieu of your more enlightened convictions, and allow me to have all the self esteem and protections of the church that you afford homosexuals? So as long as your not following Godly principles you wont mind allowing all adultresses to have the same legal and moral marital rights as the married couple correct? And since you dont care much of what God has to say about blessing Holy matrimony you wont mind if my kissin cousins marry us too?You cant possibly be opposed to one big happy family, now what wouldnt be very tolerable of you, so SEE YOU IN CHURCH. I ll be in the adultress section, just to the left of the homosexual section, and I fully expect to have the full cooperation and support of the church in my lifestyle too. I hope you undertand I am being sarcastic but at the same time I am realistic in the fact that homosexuals have equal rights already in society; they dont want marriage they want to destroy Godly precepts and the parameters set in place for moral edification and protection of the church and Gods people,and some of you ministers are leading us astray. Please consider that all societies need moral guidelines and Godly parameters for a safe and healthy life and country not just  just for the family unit, but   children   and society, as a whole need the church to be the church and a light of higher quality. PS Only an enemy of God would want to condone homosexuality and adultry. I repented and came back to God in 1998 and have by my own choice, not always easy though, taken a vow of celibacy for the past 11 years, per scripture.

1355	gayRights	I'm all for same sex couples getting married.  But it's the legal part that I disagree with.  IMHO, the legality of marriage should have nothing to do with government recognition or benefits. Governments should have a concept for Civil Unions for any two people to enter into.  A contract between the couple and the State in essence.  If the government wants to provide benefits, i.e. tax deductions, to people in a union as a result of them having kids, owning property, etc, then do so as encouragement and recognition that stable relationships can benefit the greater good of society (not that single people don't as well.)Marriage then should be, as it has become, a religious institution.

1356	gayRights	"Pliskin (Snake?), Of course you're right that sex is a personal matter that is no one else's concern because it harms no one else.  ""Live and let live"" is a pretty good basis for morality, in my view, precisely because its basis is respect for other humans,and not obedience to god's law.  Clearly theists don't see it that way.  To them ""good"" is doing what god says, ""evil"" is not doing what god says.  How an act affects (or doesn't affect) other people is irrelevant to them.  ""Live and let live"" is NOT the basis of religionist morality.  I believe that most people choose religionist morality 1) because it requires less thought, responsibility and effort to do what your told than it does to decide right and wrong for yourself, and to live with the consequences, and 2) because it can be used to justify personal prejudices (i.e. homophobia) and give them divine support.  Hence people cite bible passages that support their views, while ignoring (or ""interpreting"" others that don't.  Often, people don't form beliefs because of what the bible says, they interpret the bible to support their preconceived beliefs.

The question must always be, what does the individual value? Why? According to what factual information? According to what reason?The Judeo-Christian philosophies and religions have a long tradition, however, and despite the  claims of their adherents, they have never and never will reflect anything resembling authentically objective and universal values. They therefore cannot speak in universal terms in relation to their own group value sets, nor can they rationally compel their values on non-members of their respective groups.Whatever rights one has derives from the fact of one's own life and from nowhere else. Your own right to your life cannot be factually and logically extended to justify any ""right to the life of another"". Due to circumstances, one may be a liberty to compel the life of another, however, one cannot have the right to do so. No such right exists. One's own values must reign supreme in one's own life - even if those values are in some way borrowed from the values of others, however, one's own values, again, cannot be factually and logically extended to become the involuntary values of another.That homosexuality is universally a ""sin"" in the narrow view of Judeo-Christian-Muslim beliefs is debated even among members of those philosophies. Those beliefs, those values are not universal and cannot be argued as such. Yes, homosexuality is a sin ... to some. No, it isn't to others.

1377	gayRights	"In both of these passages, Paul uses the Greek term arsenokoite in reference to male homosexuality.  The conventional understanding has been that Paul is specifically addressing homosexuality within this passage.The pro-gay theological stance is that Paul is extremely concerned about prostitution within I Corinthians 6 and is mainly referring to male prostitutes.  This word is only used within I Corinthians and I Timothy but nowhere else in the literature of the period.(1)  John Boswell states that there were other words for ÒhomosexualÓ in the Greek language so there was little need to use this term.(2)   Also the word arsenokoite is a term that Paul has created from the words arsenos (man) and koite (couch or bed) and is specific to him.  Therefore, Paul is condemning sexual immorality in general and not referring to committed homosexual relationships.  While it is true that the term arsenokoite appears to be of PaulÕs invention, the context in which it appears is not nullified because of PaulÕs originality.  In fact, Paul coined 179 words throughout the New Testament.  The words arsenos and koiten are taken directly from the Holiness Code of the Septuagint.(3)   Because arsen is Greek for ÒmanÓ and koites means ÒbedÓ, the connotation of sexual activity is predominant.  The SeptuagintÕs translation of Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 places the words arsenos and koite in close proximity to each other and is suggested by Martii Nissinen that Paul is creating a neologism based upon the Septuagint.(4)   These are the previously referred passages in which homosexual behavior is expressly forbidden.  This further complicates the position that another meaning other than homosexuality is implied.  In I Corinthians 5:1, Paul begins by addressing sexual matters with the general term porneia, Ôsexual immoralityÕ.  This is applied to a case of heterosexual immorality in verse 1 regarding a manÕs stepmother.  In the following verses there are initial references to porneia referencing heterosexual immorality followed by arsenokoitai which references the homosexual contrast.(5)    In this context, one must consider the intent of arsenokoite in its perceived application to prostitution.  Arsenos signifying ÔmaleÕ is a clear emphasis on gender.   Koite meaning ÔcouchÕ is listed only twice in the New Testament in a sexual connotation.  There is nothing within these words that would implicate a trade or bartering.  __________________________________1 Rev.

Thus, while the Catholic Adoption Services do not ""agree"" with Same-Sex Marriage, they have been forced to either accept it or close down. The right to disagree has been taken away, and this is only one of several cases I have heard of where even non-profit organizations, religious organizations, and business have been fined for not ""agreeing"" with Same-Sex Marriage.

There's no higher incidence of   homosexuality   with same-sex parents than there is with heterosexual parents.RE: Gender Identity. In studies of   children   ranging in age from 5 to 14, results of projective testing and related interview procedures have revealed that development of gender identity among children of lesbian mothers follows the expected pattern (Green, 1978; Green, Mandel, Hotvedt, Gray, & Smith, 1986; Kirkpatrick, Smith & Roy, 1981). More direct assessment techniques to assess gender identity have been used by Golombok, Spencer, & Rutter (1983) with the same result: All children in this study reported that they were happy with their gender and that they had no wish to be a member of the opposite sex. There was no evidence in any of the studies of gender identity of any difficulties among children of lesbian mothers. No data have been reported in this area for children of gay fathers.RE: Gender-Role Behavior. A number of studies have reported that gender-role behavior among children of lesbian mothers fell within typical limits for conventional sex roles (Brewaeys et al., 1997; Golombok et al., 1983; Gottman, 1990; Green, 1978; Green et al., 1986; Hoeffer, 1981; Kirkpatrick et al., 1981; Kweskin & Cook, 1982; Patterson, 1994a). For instance, Kirkpatrick and her colleagues (1981) found no differences between children of lesbian versus heterosexual mothers in toy preferences, activities, interests, or occupational choices.RE: Sexual Orientation.  A number of investigators have also studied a third component of sexual identity, sexual orientation (Bailey, Bobrow, Wolfe, & Mickach, 1995; Bozett, 1980, 1987, 1989; Gottman, 1990; Golombok & Tasker, 1996; Green, 1978; Huggins, 1989; Miller, 1979; Paul, 1986; Rees, 1979; Tasker & Golombok, 1997). In all studies, the great majority of offspring of both lesbian mothers and gay fathers described themselves as heterosexual. Taken together, the data do not suggest elevated rates of homosexuality among the offspring of lesbian or gay parents. For instance, Huggins (1989) interviewed 36 adolescents, half of whom had lesbian mothers and half of whom had heterosexual mothers. No children of lesbian mothers identified themselves as lesbian or gay, but one child of a heterosexual mother did; this difference was not statistically significant. In another study, Bailey and his colleagues (1995) studied adult sons of gay fathers and found more than 90% of the sons to be heterosexual.Golombok and Tasker (1996, 1997) studied 25 young adults reared by divorced lesbian mothers and 21 young adults reared by divorced heterosexual mothers. They reported that offspring of lesbian mothers were no more likely than those of heterosexual mothers to describe themselves as feeling attracted to same-sex sexual partners. If they were attracted in this way, however, young adults with lesbian mothers were more likely to report that they would consider entering into a same-sex sexual relationship, and they were more likely to have actually participated in such a relationship. They were not, however, more likely to identify themselves as non-heterosexual (i.e., as lesbian, gay, or bisexual). These results were based on a small sample, and they must be interpreted with caution. At the same time, the study is the first to follow children of divorced lesbian mothers into adulthood, and it offers a detailed and careful examination of important issues.And regarding point 5, that's the issue with every divorce. Homosexual marriages aren't more likely to split up than heterosexual marriages--At least, there's no evidence saying so.	FAVOR

If being queer is perceived to be a mental disorder OR something the gay person 'chooses' to be, or could go to therapy to change, then it would be socially acceptable to stigmatize, punish, and generally discriminate against gay people.    If being queer is innate (just like being left handed), then it doesn't make sense to punish or discriminate against gay people any more than it does to discriminate against left handed people, or ANY minority group (and everyone is a member of some minority group or the other).Why is it so hard for Hope7 to accept as normal anyone who is different from themselves?   I have always been mystified by the extreme emotion, even violence, engendered in certain people against homosexuals.   It is what we call 'out of proportion'.

1421	gayRights	"Hi, Visavismeyou, I was heterosexually married for 19 years and went through adulation, disillusionment and acceptance into love. (My wife died so I cannot testify as to my ability to have a longer term relationship.) Whist studying therapy and working with individuals and couples I realised, as I did with my own relationship, that many do not realise that disillusionment is just a phase to be worked through.  My experience, as a therapist, caused me to start helping clients overcome the disillusionment stage. I have had some successes and failures, as might be expected.  Such people may feel pathetic but amount to as much as 50% of people in relationships.  This is a conservative estimate, as the number of divorces or unhappy marriages will testify      People who are ""gay"" or ""homosexual"", as used to be the label, often think they are wrong, unnatural or weird. Thus they start off their relationships doubting their abilities to love or the rightness of their choice. These doubts   add   to the 50% chances of failure and may give rise to lack of lasting relationships between persons of the same sex, compared to heterosexual ones. My argument, in the earlier section, is that the choice to be gay or not is one that is felt.  Even if the person thinks it it wrong their feelings have more influence on their behaviour than their thoughts, including judgments.   After all, it is considered quite normal for a man or woman to have strong attractions to each other.  Circumstances and common sense may stop them but their urges are there and an appropriate relationship will allow them to meet the right person and go through the mature processing of adulation, disillusionment, acceptance and love. Where an attracted couple are of the same sex they invariably take account of more internal and external judgments than heterosexual couples, as well as going through the mature processing of adulation, disillusionment, acceptance and love.  In conclusion, the decision to feel ""gay"" or heterosexual is not one to be mitigated by   legal  , moral or persuasive argument.

1424	gayRights	"WARNING: Incoming facts.""The analogy doesn't work because you could have dirty run down water fountains reserved strictly for one group and the nice clean ones for another group.""Here you claim that segregation is unconstitutional because facilities were of a lesser quality for blacks. Your implication is that were facilities absolutely equal in all respects, this would be legal. Therefore you say that since marriage and civil unions afford the same rights (which they don't even come close to doing which I have told you before, but which is irrelevant to the point) that this is also legal. Unfortunately for you your US history seems to be a bit rusty. The doctrine of separate but equal, was established in the Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson. The Supreme Court ruled that segregation was constitutional. Now in 1954 the Supreme Court made a new decision on segregation in the case Brown v. Board of Education. The constitutional basis of the case was the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. The Supreme Court decided that the quality of the black and white schools does not change the fact that separate is inherently not equal. A few quotes from the decision:""Segregation of white and Negro children in the public schools of a State solely on the basis of race, pursuant to state laws permitting or requiring such segregation, denies to Negro children the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment -- even though the physical facilities and other ""tangible"" factors of white and Negro schools may be equal.""""Here, unlike Sweatt v. Painter, there are findings below that the Negro and white schools involved have been equalized, or are being equalized, with respect to buildings, curricula, qualifications and salaries of teachers, and other ""tangible"" factors.""""To separate them from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.""So as you can see segregation would be unconstitutional regardless of the relative qualities of the things being segregated. Therefore my analogy works perfectly. Even if civil unions and marriages granted the exact same rights, which they don't, making gays get a different form of marriage ""generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone."" Consequently it is unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for homosexual unions to be given a different moniker.And if I had my druthers I would prefer states only issue civil unions to all couples and no marriage licenses because marriage has religious connotations. But barring that gays must be allowed to get married as well.""(I know this is difficult for you to grasp but) since we have separation of church and state, the supreme court doesn't have a say in what word churches use.""I never made this assertion or an assertion with this as a logical conclusion.

Marriage means quite literally the joining of entities - be it buisnesses, ideas, people, elements...etc.  But for the sake of things changing... here are some words that have changed: Commit:  to come together - but now it also means a number of other things.Luxury: originally meant ÔlasciviousnessÕ or ÔlustCookie: both means   food   and now has tech meaning as wellMouse: animal and techScroll: ancient piece of paper... and how one moves down the screenUndertaker: old meaning entrepreneur, now entrepreneur means small business ownerInspire: to breath life into - now also means to elicit, to move to action etc.Nice: use to mean 'not to know', but now it means something well... nice. :)  good.Bundle of sticks - in the old english - now is a derogatory wordGay: meant happy or merry - so quite litterally when when everyone was happy - it meant everyone was gay. Obviously the meaning has changed.  But in the case of marriage - it is not changing, at least not in the true sense of change as noted above.

1432	gayRights	"I'm not sure what you mean by ""Authors like CS Lewis in ""Mere Christianity"" have argued how there is a moral law that trascends religions"".  To me religious moral laws already inappropriately ""transcend"" the secular human realm.  I haven't read the book you mention, but what can possibly transcend the law of god as interpreted by those charged to do so?  In any case, my major concern is that the source of religious moral laws (in this case, the law against homosexuality) is god and not man.  Proper moral law must be based on the nature of humans, not on the nature of god.  ""Do what god says"" is not a moral law, because it does not ask what behaviors are good or bad for people AS people.  It simplistically says that being good consists of obeying the rules (as defined by the bible).  By this improper ""moral law"" homosexuality is a sin because, as I said, it violates the arbitrary law set down in a dusty old book.  In contrast ""Live and let live"" (for example) IS a proper moral law because it respects the nature of humans as individual moral beings with independent minds who live and relate to one another through mutual recognition, respect, and consent.  By this proper moral law homosexuality is NOT a ""sin"" because it does not violate the rights or fundamental humanity of anyone else.  You also say the ""...bible has to be analised literally, symbolically and historically"".  This is a contradiction.  It can be taken literally or NOT literally.  It either IS the literal word of god, or its open to interpretation.  If it IS the literal word of god, then you cannot re-interpret any part of it to your liking.  And if its NOT the literal word of god, then it is not the authoritative law for human behavior or anything else, for that matter.  It is hypocrisy to take parts of the bible literally while ""interpreting"" other parts.  And once you ""interpret"" it, either symbolically or historically or in any other way, you have put your judgement (or the judgement of other humans) above the word of god.  "	FAVOR

How exactly does two guys getting married stop you from providing your ideal environment to your children?  It shouldn't. On the other hand, I noticed that you argued that the purpose of marriage is to have children, and no other purpose should be allowed.  The vast array of legal benefits to marriage are completely irrelevant in your mind, right?  Fine, if the sole purpose of marriage is for the children, you will have no objection to immediately stripping all legal rights granted to spouses.  You said yourself, the purpose of marriage is not to grant rights.  It also seems that those who will not or cannot have children, like me, should not be allowed to marry even if they are heterosexual.

1436	gayRights	"(I'm going to have to split this response into a series of posts, since you have brought up so many issues. Please pardon any inconvenience, but I want to be sure I address all of your points)Apparently my answer was not clear, since you have drawn so many incorrect conclusions from it.  Let me take them one by one:MARTIN: ""I see you marked YES to the question of whether or not people are born gay. But the presence of a spectrum at all necessitates the idea of choice (as you put it, ""for some"").""MY RESPONSE: Yes.  I believe people are born with the sexual orientation which they carry through life.  Some people are born exclusively (or nearly so) gay.  They are rarely if ever attracted to the opposite gender, and would be incapable of sustaining a meaningful and satisfying intimate relationship with a person of the opposite gender.  They may or may not be capable of completing a sexual act with someone of the opposite gender, but regardless of that ability or inability, could not have a satisfying marriage or long-term commitment to someone of the opposite gender.There are people who are similarly exclusive in their attractions to the opposite gender, and who would be incapable of sustaining a satisfying and fulfilling committed, long-term marital relationship with someone of their own gender, even if some of them could complete a sexual act with someone of their own gender.Then there are those who fall somewhere else along the spectrum, perhaps 50% attracted to their own gender and 50% to the opposite, or 75% to their own, and 25% to the opposite, or vice versa.  Such people might find a satisfying and sexually and emotionally fulfilling relationship with a person of either gender.My guess would be that the majority fall fairly close to the 90-100% ""straight"" end of the spectrum, with an increasingly sparse scatter towards the middle and ""gay"" end.The point, however, is that wherever they are on the spectrum, that is where they were born and that is where they will die.  Those who fall closest to the 50% mark at the middle of the spectrum experience their sexual orientation as a ""choice.""  This does not mean that they ""chose"" to be bisexual.  Their orientation is as it is.  Their choice comes from the fact that they experience attractions to both genders relatively equally, and have a choice to be equally satisfied with a ""gay"" or a ""straight"" relationship.There is nothing in my earlier post which contradicts this view.MARTIN: ""This is a question that necessitates something like a ""gay gene"" analogous to those who are born with male-pattern baldness or something like that. Studies confirm that men are born with the genetic code for male-pattern baldness. I have yet to see any conclusive study on this same type of thing for homosexuality. And yet I continue to hear about it over and over again . . . getting a little boring I think. ""I also find that the idea of bisexuality seems to contradict a ""gay gene."" It seems to me that the idea of being born a certain way means you either have it or you don't. Do you follow my logic? So, if someone has the gene, they are gay. If they do not, they are straight. But this is not the case at all. If a male child is born with ""male-pattern baldness,"" there is nothing he can do about it short of taking treatments or wearing a hairpiece or getting plugs. What you are saying is that there is a genetic make-up that means that certain people are 100% gay and certain people are 100% straight. This is not what Kinsey found and this is not supported by any studies that I know of. In Sexual Behavior and the Human Male, Alfred Kinsey wrote this: ÒMales do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goatsÉThe living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects.""

Each of these are very seperate and distinct arguements.The legal basis for marriage exists to ensure the rights that the states and federal government provide such as visitation in hospitals, tax incentives, etc.  Should there be an objection on a religious basis this is for each church, synagogue, mosque, etc to determine on their own what they choose to do, from their own religious standpoint.

This may be the case, but the ""clarification"" has been gleaned from a few snippets throughout the bible and strung together to make a mountain out of what may never have even been a molehill. My fervent wish is that the churches of today give as little time to the whole morality - or lack thereof - of homosexuality as the Bible itself does. They happily do this for many other rules and sins in the bible that are quietly sidelined as no longer relevant to today - for example, women as chattels of men, the nationality of slaves, the correct ways of killing various animals, etc. Yet they fixate on gays and lesbians - who really just wish to be left alone.I am a gay man in Sydney, Australia, in a committed homosexual relationship that brings me the most amazing love, joy and fulfillment. I have the blessing of my whole family - because they see how happy I am with my partner, who is a beautiful, loving and faithful man. I have never used drugs and my many days of charity work extend to all parts of my community, not just HIV/AIDS. I try to give to society as much as I've received from it. I have many friends of all kinds and ages - including my wonderful parents - and my life is rich and free. I refuse to believe that any god would not wish this for all people.

I see this as a sin because it not only does a disservice to those involved but it is against what we were naturally created for, a man and a woman. If this were not a sin there would have been two guys in the beginning or two women for that matter. Since men and women were created for the purpose of completing each other as well as to reproduce it is easy to say that a homosexual relationship is sinful. That is what is taught however for Christian homosexuals such as myself it causes a major debate. God says no to this but every sin is forgiven if a person strives for a personal relationship with Christ.Therefore I believe it is a sin but nothing greater or less than any other sin such as murder, lying, betrayal, hatred, etc.	AGAINST

1445	gayRights	"Of course, preference for homosexual relationships has a genetic origin just as any other sort of sexual behavior, however, genetic predisposition for certain behaviors does not imply one will or ought to act on that predisposition. Genetics simply sets the parameters of a life, it does not dictate which choices one will make in behavior within those parameters. Genetics establishes the available choices. It is up to you to actually make the choice. There is no doubt, although a heterosexual prefers the opposite gender as a sexual partner, they are at least capable of choosing differently. Homosexuality, bisexuality or asexuality are options open to them. All that limits their choices is their thinking and emotions and, of course context. So too the homosexual or the asexual. Although the homosexual prefers the same sex or the asexual no sex at all, the first can conceivably choose sexual relations with a different gender given a different frame of mind and a different context and the asexual could conceivably choose to have sex given those same conditions. Genetics originates the preference and specific available choices but it does not dictate the specific behaviors within one's power to choose among alternatives. No one is necessarily  constrained by preference unless they choose to be which, if you think about it, isn't constraint at all. Genetically-rooted preference for sex with the same gender or the opposite gender or something else entirely isn't a collar around anyone's neck, however, the genetic need to consume fuel and fluid and air to continue living is a leg iron locked to us all.None of this is to say, as many critics of homosexuality, asexuality, bisexuality or any other type of sexual behavior OTHER than heterosexuality are want to do, that because one CAN choose a heterosexual lifestyle that one MUST choose it. That a predisposition toward homosexuality still allows freedom to choose a different lifestyle isn't criticism against homosexuality any more than freedom of choice in one's heterosexuality is criticism of that lifestyle. Heterosexuals can choose homosexual or bisexual or asexual behavior even if they usually don't and believe they never will. One cannot claim the ability to predict all future choices given the truth that no one can predict all the future contexts in which one will find oneself. No, that one can choose which preferences one expresses through behavior isn't automatic criticism of any particular choice in the set of alternatives.Many among critics of homosexuality claim the lifestyle to be ""unnatural"" which is nonsensical because, by definition, anything one can do is necessarily natural. One cannot do something that is ""outside of nature"" because there is no ""outside"". All that we have done, do or will do is natural and cannot be otherwise. Second, these persons also point out that homosexuality is non-reproductive and therefore a threat to the survival of the species. This could only be true if ""survival of the species"" were a duty on the head of every individual. It clearly is not. ""Species"" is an abstract concept. It is not something that exists in and of itself. It is merely a way of speaking of all human individuals as a set. That there IS a human species in no way implies there MUST be a human species and therefore each individual human being has the duty to reproduce. Reproduction and the reason why one chooses to reproduce are always individual and relative to one's own life. There is no inescapable necessity to make children. Certainly, if the human species comes to an end it would be a tragedy for human beings but we can be quite satisfied nature and life on Earth will continue with or without human beings. Human beings are certainly an element of nature but cannot claim to be an essential element of nature. Sexual behavior CAN be reproductive but there is no implication it MUST be reproductive and certainly no implication it must ALWAYS be reproductive. Even most heterosexuals enjoy non-reproductive sex. All in all, if all human sexual behavior were necessarily reproductive, the Earth would swiftly become overrun by human beings OR human beings would severely limit their sexual behavior to limit the creation of more like them for practical reasons - not religious ones. Of course, there is much reason to insist that human beings restrict reproduction for practical reasons already. In light of those quite obvious practical concerns, one would expect human cultures to embrace non-reproductive and non-heterosexual sex rather than continually criticizing them. But, perhaps, the criticism of non-reproductive sex is merely the noise of the squeakiest wheels on the cart rather than the opinion of the majority."	FAVOR
1446	gayRights	"No, we do NOT know that ""people can...change from one to the other.""  What we know is that there is some percentage of the population which is innately bisexual, and may fall in love with or be attracted to members of his or her own gender as well as the opposite.  Such people could correctly be described as having a ""choice.""  However, they do not make up the sum total of the population.  There are significant percentages on either end who are either exclusively (or nearly so) attracted to members of the opposite gender, or exclusively (or nearly so) attracted to members of their own gender.As to a gene, or more likely a SET of genes, which give evolutionary advantage to those who carry some or all of them, the hypothesis, however difficult it might be to prove, is a good one, as we have any number of examples of such genetic characteristics in the data already, including the sickle cell example I gave earlier.  Can I prove the hypothesis?  Of course not.  Not yet, anyway.  Geneticists are finding new information about the human genome every day.  The probability that a genetic link will be found is strong.  And considering the abilities, behaviors and talents which can be readily identified in a significant percentage of the gay population, it is highly likely that there is a significant evolutionary advantage conferred by that set of genes, whether it be in creative abilities, or in more prosaic areas such as enhanced abilities to form the family and group bonds which were the basis of individual safety and strong social networks in the early history of human civilization.

It is this ""sameness"" that is unacceptable and irresponsible, because it forces on society the unscientific and wrong idea (though politically correct) that two moms or two dads is just as good as a mom and a dad.Yes, in the real world, situations are different.  I'd much rather a same sex couple care for a child than a single parent, or a single parent instead of no parent.  Obviously, this is not an either/or.

1459	gayRights	"I've read all the arguments and Focus on the Family had 1 excellent point.  ""the more precise question is Òdisadvantaged compared to what?Ó.  After they say that they go on and on about how great it is when   kids   are raised by their married biological mom and dad.  You know what, they may be right about that.  On average (certainly not in every case but on average) kids are probably better off being raised by their married biological parents (BTW, those married biological parents could be gay).  Thing is, that's not an option for these kids.  Their biological parents can't, or won't, raise them anymore.  Kids that are up for   adoption   aren't being pulled out of the homes of perfectly good married heterosexual parents.  Kids that are up for adoption are in orphanages, or bouncing around from one foster home to another.  I think we can all agree that's not an ideal way for a kid to grow up.  So the real question isn't whether having straight parents is better than having gay parents.  The question is, is it better to bounce from foster home to foster home, never living with the same parents for more than a few years, never setting down roots and making long term family or friend connections, or, is it better for a child to be raised by a loving gay couple who want to love them, and take care of them throughout their childhood.  Personally I think it's obviously better to be raised by loving gay parents but you can all make your own decision.  The important thing is that you make that decision based on the facts, not some scare tactics FOTF is throwing out.  The choice isn't married straight parents or gays.  The choice is orphanage/foster care or gays.  Which do you think is better?"	FAVOR

1466	gayRights	"hey rick,my bad for the long wait.  i've had some pressing 'youth ministry' issues that i needed to attend to.  anyways, let's carry on this conversation.in regards to your question about sodom ... just because the word ""homosexual"" doesn't always accompany the passages about sodom's sin, doesn't mean that it wasn't apart of sodom's downfall.  notice that i say 'apart'.  i agree with you that homosexuality wasn't the only sin that brought destruction upon the city, but it definately played its role.  i read your comments about how JESUS never said anything about homosexuality and sodom, so therefore the sin of sodom had nothing to do with homosexuality.  i totally disagree with you.  i think that the homosexual sin was well known to people, so HE didn't have to explain it.  when people spoke of sodom, they connected the sin of homosexuality to it.  i can see JESUS talking about the other sins within the town more so because these sins were often overlooked, as 'petty issues' so to say, just as they still are in most american churches today.jude 1:7 connects sodom with 'sexual immorality' - which includes homosexual relationships: In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.  (      )here's a question i have with your argument.  knowing that several other towns/cities were rude and had horrible towards GOD'S messengers, why didn't GOD also destroy those places as well?  you state in your article that, ""The sin of Sodom, according to Jesus, was inhospitality to GodÕs messengers.""  but if this is true, then why didn't GOD destroy Jerusalem because the Jews rejected the messages of the disciples.  why didn't GOD destroy every other place that rejected HIS messengers?in speaking about the passages of scripture used to call homosexuality as sin - especially Leviticus - all i can say is that GOD'S word is GOD'S word.  the natural order GOD set up in the beginning was male and female, and the charge for them was to produce offspring.  i do believe that those verses of homosexuality do condemn it mostly because it went totally against the created order GOD established over us.  regardless if it's pagan worship or committed same-sex relationships, is still against what GOD set into place.in addition to this, there are several other times when GOD talks about things being an abomination (toevah) that are not connected to idol worship, such as Proverbs 6:16-19.  as joe dallas notes in his book a strong delusion, ""the prohibitions against homosexuality in Leviticus appear alongside other sexual sins ... which are forbidden in both [testaments] ... [these references] show GOD'S displeasure with them whether or not any ceremony or idolatry is involved"" (193).  he also makes another point stating that if these other practices only pertained to idol worship, then child sacrifice, adultery, incest, and the like would all be permissible as long as it was done apart form idol worship.  rick, that's exactly what you're suggesting as well.  outside of 'idol worship' is incest a sin?  what about adultery?  child sacrifice?again, you mention about david and jonathan and their 'same-sex' relationship.  i think we beat that issue over the head enough times.  if both men were gay, explain the wives they had - was their 'gayness' like a light switch?  it doesn't make sense.you stated:  For the other 5%, exclusive, same sex marriage partnerships between two men or two women were NOT the norm in Biblical times.well if this is correct, my question is why wasn't it the norm back then?  if there was nothing wrong with homosexuality, even back in the day, why wasn't it a norm just like every other couple in a committed relationship?  i think it wasn't the norm because everyone knew it was a sin!  yeah, JESUS never spoke about it, so the 'silence argument' can be used, but then again i can use the same argument - JESUS never accepted the lifestyle either.  never!**************************************************************************you asked me why i have a deep conviction of this topic and where i stand on.  my conviction simply comes from years of studying this subject by pouring over scripture, reading books (from both sides), praying, and other things.this past august marked an 8 year journey out of homosexuality.  up until that point, i was very active in 'the life', even at one time being engaged to a man (i am 30 now).  my convictions are born out of what GOD has done within my life and the revelation HE has given me through HIS word by HIS Spirit.  like i said before, this is my conviction."

1467	gayRights	"In the New Testament there are three passages to consider. Romans 1:21, 26, 27Revised Standard Version21 for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him...26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men... The King James and New International versions say virtually the same thing. Romans 1:26 and 27 clearly speak of same-gender sex by both men and women, the only passage in the New Testament that does so. Rom. 1:18-32 speaks of Gentiles (heterosexuals) who could and should have known and served and given thanks to God but would not, so God gave them up and let them do whatever they wanted to do, and that resulted in degrading and shameful acts, including same-gender sex. It is almost a moot point, but Paul is not listing sins for which God will condemn anyone, he is listing sins that occur because people have forsaken Him. These are acts committed by those who have turned away from God and so become ""consumed with passion."" All of us recognize that those who forsake God and give themselves over to lustful living--homosexual or heterosexual--stand condemned by the Bible. This passage is talking about people who chose to forsake God.Conservative theologian Richard Hays says, ""No direct appeal to Romans 1 as a source of rules about sexual conduct is possible.""B-6 I Corinthians 6:9King James Version:9...Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate [malakoi], nor abusers of themselves with mankind [arsenokoitai], 10 Nor thieves..., shall inherit the kingdom of God. New International Version9...Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes [malakoi] nor homosexual offenders [arsenokoitai] 10 nor thieves...will inherit the kingdom of God.Revised Standard Version--1952 edition:9...Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals [malakoi and arsenokoitai], 10 nor thieves..., will inherit the kingdom of God.Revised Standard Version--1971 edition:9...Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts [malakoi and arsenokoitai], 10 nor thieves..., will inherit the kingdom of God.A comparison of how the two Greek words are translated in the different versions shows that translations often, unfortunately, become the interpretations of the translators. In I Cor. 6:9 Paul lists the types of persons who will be excluded from the kingdom of God and for some he uses the Greek words malakoi and arsenokoitai. KJ translates the first ""effeminate,"" a word that has no necessary connection with homosexuals. The NIV translates the first ""male prostitutes"" and the second, ""homosexual offenders"". The RSV in its first edition of 1952 translated both words by the single term, ""homosexuals"". In the revised RSV of 1971, the translation ""homosexuals"" is discarded and the two Greek words are translated as ""sexual perverts""; obviously the translators had concluded the earlier translation was not supportable.Malakoi literally means ""soft"" and is translated that way by both KJ and RSV in Matt. 11:8 and Luke 7:25. When it is used in moral contexts in Greek writings it has the meaning of morally weak; a related word, malakia, when used in moral contexts, means dissolute and occasionally refers to sexual activity but never to homosexual acts. There are at least five Greek words that specifically mean people who practice same-gender sex. Unquestionably, if Paul had meant such people, he would not have used a word that is never used to mean that in Greek writings when he had other words that were clear in that meaning. He must have meant what the word commonly means in moral contexts, ""morally weak."" There is no justification, most scholars agree, for translating it ""homosexuals.""Arsenokoitai, is not found in any extant Greek writings until the second century when it apparently means ""pederast"", a corrupter of boys, and the sixth century when it is used for husbands practicing anal intercourse with their wives. Again, if Paul meant people practicing same-gender sex, why didn't he use one of the common words? Some scholars think probably the second century use might come closest to Paul's intention. If so, there is no justification for translating the word as ""homosexuals."" Other scholars see a connection with Greek words used to refer to same-gender sex in Leviticus. If so, it is speaking of heterosexuals given to such lust they turn to such acts.Richard Hays tells us, ""I Corinthians 6:9-11 states no rule to govern the conduct of Christians.""B-7One commentator has another reason for rejecting the NIV and original RSV translations, ""homosexuals."" Today it could mean that a person who is homosexual in orientation even though ""of irreproachable morals, is automatically branded as unrighteous and excluded from the kingdom of God, just as if he were the most depraved of sexual perverts.""B-8So I Cor. 6:9 says nothing about homosexuality with the possible exception of condemnable pederasty.I Tim. 1:10King James Version:9...the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners,...10...for them that defile themselves with mankind (arsenokoitai)...Revised Standard Version - both 1952 and 1971 editions:9...the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for 10 immoral persons, sodomites (arsenokoitai),...New International Version:9...the law is not made for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful...10 for adulterers and perverts (arsenokoitai)Here only the RSV specifically refers to same-gender sex, using the term ""sodomites,"" which is the translation given in both the Old Testament and New Testament to Hebrew and Greek words for male temple prostitutes. The KJV probably has the same thought. The NIV does not necessarily refer to same-gender sex. Again Paul has used the Greek word arsenokoitai, the word in I Cor. 6:9.As discussed above, this word would have no reference to homosexuality or homosexual sex in our discussion.So like the other two New Testament passages, I Tim. 1:10 says nothing about homosexuality or homosexuals and nothing about same-gender sex unless that of temple prostitutes or possibly the molestation of young boys by heterosexuals.In view of the facts set forth above, we realize there is no moral teaching in the Bible about homosexuality as we know it, including homosexual sex (except possibly pederasty). The Bible cannot be used to condemn as immoral all same-gender sex. It clearly condemns lust, whether homosexual or heterosexual. There is certainly nothing in the Bible about anyone going to hell because he or she is homosexual. All who go to hell will go for the same, one reason: failure to commit their lives in faith to Jesus Christ as their lord and savior. From a slightly different approach to interpretation, Dr. Robin Scroggs states, ""The basic model in today's Christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the New Testament that the criterion of reasonable similarity of context is not met. The conclusion I have to draw seems inevitable: Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today's debate.""B-9 [Italics his] Dr. Gomes concludes his discussion of homosexuality and the Bible with these words:The Biblical writers never contemplated a form of homosexuality in which loving, monogamous, and faithful persons sought to live out the implications of the gospel with as much fidelity to it as any heterosexual believer. All they knew of homosexuality was prostitution, pederasty, lasciviousness, and exploitation. These vices, as we know, are not unknown among heterosexuals, and to define contemporary homosexuals only in these terms is a cultural slander of the highest order, reflecting not so much prejudice, which it surely does, but what the Roman Catholic Church calls ""invincible ignorance,"" which all of the Christian piety and charity in the world can do little to conceal. The ""problem,"" of course, is not the Bible, it is the Christians who read it.B-10"	FAVOR
1468	gayRights	"I believe that every human being is born genetically, physically, emotionally, spiritually and psychologically fallen.  No one is born perfect.  While I think it is far to simplistic to think that someone is born gay, the truth is that no one currently knows all of the factors that contribute to one's behavioral makeup.  I believe that genetics, environment and even our personalities factor into who we are and what we do.  As someone who never chose to ""feel"" gay, but who nonetheless found myself with those very real and complex desires, I admit that I do not know every reason why I experienced the sexual urges, impulses and attractions that I did starting at puberty.  However, I am extremely grateful for the fact that we live in a world where self determination is a high value.  Each individual has the God-given right to decide for themselves how they are going to respond to the impulses and attractions that they have.  For a period of my life I ""chose"" to act according to my feelings and when I realized that those actions weren't congruent with my greatest desire---to live according to my faith in Christ---then I ""chose"" to give up homosexuality and set out on the long, difficult but ultimately overwhelmingly fulfilling journey of putting Christ first.  Bottom line: just because something is ""genetic"" doesn't make it optimal, healthy or moral.  All sorts of things are said to have a genetic link from cancer to obesity to rage to alcoholism.  Not all of those things are immoral but they are all unhealthy and no one would choose them.  So, genetically linked or not, homosexuality isn't something that one has to live in tyranny under.  We each have a choice to make based upon our unchosen feelings and can decide how we are going to respond to our circumstances based on all of the facts.18 years after deciding to leave homosexuality I am thrilled that I did.  The life I lived as a celibate and single man was far more rewarding than gay life.  For 11 years now my life with my wife, Leslie, has been the greatest joy of my life as were the additions of my two adopted newborns in 2005.Rogaine for Women said it best a few years back: ""Stronger than genetics to overcome baldness.""

I can choose to resist the temptations of that lifestyle but I will always be bisexual. Rarely do you have an obvious example set in front of you like this but keep it in mind when you say that it is a genetic trait or it is a choice.	AGAINST
1491	gayRights	Spencer-I appreciate your honesty. It speaks well of your character. That being said, the basis of your viewpoint is Complementarianism - that God intends everyone to be heterosexual, that God is adamantly opposed to every intimate human partnership except those which replicate the Adam and Eve model.Of course, the Bible never takes that position. That is something which the scripture does not say but which Complementarians read into the Bible. In plainer words, it is a private interpretation.        By taking the clobber passages out of context and insisting they refer to homosexuality and lesbianism when no human author of the Bible ever linked Sodom and homosexuality (let alone lesbianism) in any of the 48 passages where Sodom is used, the Ex-Gay industry has convinced you to believe a lie.

If morality is not subjective, which I believe it is not, then the question becomes, does God set moral laws because they are what is moral and right, OR are things that are moral right because God says so. I'm personally of the first opinion, but don't see it necessary to bring God into it at all. Morality does not need God to exist, but with the inclusion, I believe he sets moral laws out because they are right, not the other way around.	FAVOR

If there was some way to objectively gauge whether a child being raised in a   safe  , secure and calm heterosexual home was any better-off (or perhaps worse-off) than a child being raised in a safe, secure and calm homosexual home then we could talk about this topic intelligently.  All we can do right now is make analogies and comparisons while talking about our own conjecture and limited experiences.  I am personally witnessing a boy being raised in a lesbian home and have been watching him grow for the last 15 years (he is 15 years old).  The couple raising him are very intelligent and caring individuals, but there just seems something odd about the young man, the way he acts and talks, the things he says, are all odd, I will not go into detail, however, there definitely is something off about him.  Beyond that, I am not even sure it is causal, perhaps he would have been odd if raised by a heterosexual couple, I cannot know this, however, in the current lack of knowledge that we have as a culture, I am opposed to homosexual   parenting  .

1510	gayRights	"Many Christians say   homosexuality   is a choice. Science, logic, common sense, real life accounts, and psychologists all prove this wrong. Any educated Christian or person knows that homosexuality is not a choice. You cannot choose your sexual attractions. They try to use the cop-out that, ""its the behavior"" but that behavior is caused by the initial sexual attraction, which you cannot change. If you feel you can change your sexual attraction, you might want to re-evaluate your sexuality, because you are not straight, but bi-sexual. Now within the group of people that think being   gay   is a choice, they fall in 2 groups.Group 1: The bigots, who try to find any excuse to condone their   discrimination  . Group 2: People who actually are good people, but not informed or know enough about gay people, and thus still think its a choice.I am speaking to group 2 here. Group 1 are bigots that will never change their mind, but that generation will die out like the racist generations. Group 2 read on.-Virtually all major psychological and medical experts agree that sexual orientation is NOT a choice-Most gay people will tell you its not a choice-Common sense will tell you its not a choiceWhile   science   is relatively new to studying homosexuality, studies tend to indicate that its biological.

When you see a naked woman, it goes up right? They turn you on emotionally and sexually right? Now how about when you see a naked man? Does your pulse raise in the same way? Are you enjoying it? Do you go up? Do you feel sexual urges in the same way? Do men turn you on emotionally and sexually? Does male/male   porn   turn you on sexually? Would you be able to enjoy sex with a man? Do you find men sexually attractive? Could you be happy sexually with a man for the rest of your life? If you are heterosexual, the answer should be no. Otherwise, you might either be bi-sexual or   homosexual  , and might want to re-evaluate your sexuality. It is well known that a lot of homophobes deny their homosexuality by being aggressive towards it, until they finally accept it. Most people know this is not a choice, and it would be ignorant claiming it so. I know a few gay people who went to a straight club when they were figuring out their sexuality, where women were putting their naked bodies all over them, giving them naked lap dances, not once did the gay men get it up or aroused. But just the picture of a naked guy gets them up easily. Tell me thats choice. Also, why would a gay person, knowing that you will have a rough time in   society  , knowing that you cant get married unless you live in certain places, knowing that people will pick on you for it, knowing that your closest friends and families might completely turn their back on you, choose to be gay, if they could easily be satisfied by the opposite sex?

ALL of my same sex FEMALE friends who have children also have the healthy male role models in their childs life, to balance what they cannot be, lets get real. HOWEVER just because 2 women will never be anything other than, DOES NOT mean the child will suffer. Marriage, 50% divorce rate, so if a child is all happy and carefree, getting the BEST of mom and dad, oh wait how good could it have been if the child was/is living in an enviornment where mommy and daddy are beginning the steps towards divorce, the child has to live with it while it's happening, watch it, hear it and feel it. Face it it doesn't happen over night so how long has the child been exposed? And divorce...50% is an extremely high rate so how does that show mommy and daddy have something special called marriage? Lets see...and then there's the same sex parents who actually give birth or adopt. No ""whoops"" there, it's planned out, saved for and wanted. That child is sooo loved before they even arrive, and if indeed they adopted, who's child was it? Probably some lesbian out there trying to sabotage numbers of hetrosexual throw away babies that come from that precious gift of reproduction that's taken for granted and has no real value, just like the life that was created in a careless moment and given away, (but thank you for not aborting!).Children...and on this note, WHY are yours so much better than mine? WHY does my child HAVE to sit in PUBLIC school and be taught about your family and never see their family reflected in the teachings? WHY are you dictating to our children their lessons? Oh thats right...YOU have all the rights, yours are the only ones that count, what would happen if indeed YOUR child was teased, bullied and taunted every day and then committed suicide? Ohhhh, heads would role, but hey when its the child of a same sex couple or just a young person who discovers they are gay, it's ok? So children, I think same sex couples and families do a better job as they teach their children respect for ALL, compassion, empathy(we've been there) and to not judge or discriminate, most I know are faith based, just not fanatical based or the corporate organized   religion   type.

Statistics showthat homosexual men, who represent less than 3 percent of the adultmale population, commit a disproportionate number (one-third or more cases of child sexual molestation. The report, ""Homosexualityand Child Sexual Abuse,"" authored by Dr. Timothy J. Dailey (availableat   www.frc.org  .), is being sent to parents, youth groups, schooladministrators, Catholic bishops, and religious organizations.FRC's report comes at a time when the nation has been rocked byscandals of child sexual abuse and when homosexuals argue that youthorganizations such as the Boy Scouts should be forced to includehomosexuals as leaders. Similarly, gay activist organizations areencouraging homosexual teachers to share their sexuality with theirstudents. Many parents have become concerned that   children   may bemolested, encouraged to become sexually active, or even ""recruited""into adopting a homosexual identity and lifestyle.""Homosexuality and Child Sexual Abuse"" examines the following evidencelinking homosexuality to pedophilia:Pedophiles are invariably males: Almost all sex crimes againstchildren are committed by men.Significant numbers of victims are males: Up to one-third of all sexcrimes against children are committed against boys (as opposed togirls).The 10 percent fallacy: Studies indicate that, contrary to theinaccurate but widely accepted claims of sex researcher Alfred Kinsey,homosexuals comprise between 1 to 3 percent of the population.Homosexuals are overrepresented in child sex offenses: Those among the1 to 3 percent of the population that is sexually attracted to thesame sex are committing up to one-third of the sex crimes againstchildren.Some homosexual activists defend the historic connection betweenhomosexuality and pedophilia: Such activists consider the defense of""boy-lovers"" to be a legitimate gay rights issue.Pedophile themes abound in homosexual literary culture: Gay fiction aswell as serious academic treatises promote ""intergenerationalintimacy.""""Children have become the last sexual frontier,"" FRC President KenConnor said.

1516	gayRights	In the beginning of my argument I explained why I would not choose to allow a homosexual to adopt. Primarily, the homosexual is inescapably self-centered. The conclusion is to be understood as a universal statement of all homosexuals, not particular. And hence, no explanation is required when itÕs two homosexuals seeking to adopt. However, I will now take the time to compound my argument with additional facts after already having logically established my position.  You claim that my argument, Ôfail(s) to address (is) how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit. My reply is yes, I did not address that question, now consider my explanation. You are requesting that I prove a negative conclusion, i.e. how a gay couple would NOT make a suitable parental unit. It is logically impossible to prove a negative conclusion. I cannot syllogistically arrive at a negative conclusion from negative propositions. The burden of proof belongs to those who claim that homosexuals are suitable parents. Consider the example of what you have accused my argument of lacking.Gays are bad, the bad should not adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is valid, but it is petition principii, begging the question. Gays are not good, only the good should adopt; therefore, gays should not adopt. The argument is invalid and fallacious.Gays are perverts, perverts are evil; therefore, gays should not adopt. Argument is both invalid and fallacious.Gays are not evil, evil is not good; therefore, gays are not good. (Again invalid and fallacious) Or you could say: 1 is not 2, 2 is not 3; therefore 1 is not 3. . (Again invalid and fallacious)There are an unlimited number of examples that I could use to demonstrate the impossibility of syllogistically proving a negative conclusion. I suppose the examples IÕve provided shall suffice for the subject at hand.They who would argue that homosexuals are suitable parents must be burdened by the burden of proof to logically prove their point.  I truly did go to an extreme conclusion in my last argument, as you have stated. Yet, only for the purpose of reductio ad absurdum, reducing the proposition until it is obviously false. And lastly, your reference to the legal system is an appeal to authority, Argumentum Ad Verecundium. (the truth, falsity, or validity of an argument is not subject to a legal system)Bare in mind that my arguments are for the sake of knowledge and not the sake of attacking or debating; so take no offence for none is intended.

Same sex couples who love each other want similar legal rights.  Second, the law should not be based off of   religion  .  It is important for a   society   to have morals; individual rights and freedom should be protected, whether it's their   right to life  , property, or opinions.

Up until then I believed everything was just as perfect and I would have to say that I was probably at an advantage over most of the other families I knew, simply because of the fact that we were all still a family.  One day my father caught my mother cheating on him with another female.  Now, kudos to both of them because I will have to say they did one heck of a job keeping us three   kids   out of the mess that had been created.  Of course, divorce followed and soon I watched our family crumble into pieces from that day forward.  I knew what was going on, but I never brought it up.  It was a little embarrassing, so as far as everyone else, I was just a good kid going through tough time at home. Eventually, my mother came out to us and it was not different than it was before.  For two-thirds of the time under my parents roof, everything was great.  The last third was a mess!!  Not because, she was gay, or even the fact that I was gay, it was the ugly, messy divorce.  The odd thing was that my father never really met anyone until many years later, but my mother had a   girlfriend   who lived with her.  I am here to tell you now that homes with two parents, any parents whether they are gay, straight, blue or brown, are the ones at an advantage.  For the most part I was better off living with my mother and her girlfriend than with my father, not because   money  , or lifestyle, or anything else.  It was simply because of the single parent home versus the two parent home factor.  It was hell going through all of that, and the only thing that put me at a disadvantage was the divorce.  	FAVOR

Amen. For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deciet, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, backs-biters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; who, knowing the righteous judgement of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them.

Assuming an individual is not infringing the liberty of another to exercise their individual rights, that individual is owed to them the liberty to do the same.I must remind those who object to granting liberty to same-sex couples to marry one another that, regardless of how right you believe your viewpoint and values, there are always thousands of individuals in the United States who disagree with your points of view, your beliefs, your values, your chosen lifestyle. Perhaps some of those who disagree with and object to you would see that you lose some liberties to enforce their point of view upon your choices. If you would not have the practice of suppressing liberties because the lifestyle of another makes you uncomfortable become a standard approach to relationships in cultures, perhaps you ought not encourage such thinking by thinking in such ways yourself. You will, no doubt, be forging the chains you will someday wear.If you wish to live with optimum liberty, although you do not owe another your agreement, you DO owe any and all your respect of their liberties. If you do not believe this true, then you explicitly disagree with a culture that holds as its highest value individual rights and liberties.

1558	gayRights	ÒThe results of the present study, which is the first based on a large national sample of adolescents living with same-sex couples, revealed that on nearly all of a large array of variables related to school and personal adjustment, adolescents with same-sex parents did not differ significantly from a matched group of adolescents living with opposite-sex parents.  Regardless of family type, adolescents were more likely to show favorable adjustment when they perceived more caring from adults and when parents described close relationships with them.  Thus, as has been reported in studies of children with lesbian mothers (e.g., Chan et al., 1998), it was the qualities of adolescent-parent relationships rather than the structural features of families (e.g., same vs. opposite-sex parents) that were significantly associated with adolescent adjustment (Golombok, 1999; Patterson, 2000).Ó p. 1895ÒAcross a diverse array of assessments, we found that the personal, family, and school adjustment of adolescents living with same-sex parents did not differ from that of adolescents living with opposite-sex parents.  Consistent with the findings of earlier research (e.g., Huggins, 1989), we found that adolescent self-esteem did not vary as a function of family type.  In addition, we found no differences as a function of family type in measures of personal adjustment, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety; in measures of school adjustment, such as academic achievement, trouble in school, or feelings of school connectedness; or in measures of the qualities of family relationships, such as autonomy, care from adults and peers, neighborhood integration, or parental warmth.  The clarity of results from this broad array of assessments strengthens our confidence that adolescents living with same-sex parents were functioning well in many domains, both at home and at school.Ó p. 1895Furthermore, consider the following:Mental Health Issues in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Communities. Eds. Billy E. Jones and Marjorie J. Hill.  American Psychiatric Publishing: Washington, D.C., 2002.ÒHopefully, psychiatrists and other mental health professionals know that there is no one lesbian or one gay lifestyle or point of view on matters that are important to the parenting of children.  Therefore, any lesbian or gay parent must be given the benefit of an individualized assessment as it relates to her or his lifestyle and point of view and how these might or might not impact on the parent's ability to offer the child permanence, stability, a moral environment, guidance, and a generally healthy upbringing.  Of course, to perform such an assessment, the psychiatrist must be able to integrate accurate knowledge and a sound understanding of parenting and the needs of developing children with an equally accurate knowledge and a sound understanding of gay and lesbian parents.  Similarly, when testifying in child custody and visitation proceedings involving a gay or lesbian parent, psychiatrists must help the court understand that there is enormous diversity within the gay and lesbian community, that the testimony being given is based on an individualized assessment of the particular parent, and that the opinions rendered are supported by the information gathered during the process of the evaluation and by a well-informed body of knowledge that has been used to interpret that information.Ó p. 46	FAVOR

The Ten Commandments were written thousands of years before the bible was written.  That answers that question.Many people believe the bible should be taken literally. Please then explain the following:In Numbers 31:1-18, God commands Moses to kill all the adult male Midianites and kidnap all the women and children.  The the Lord commanded Moses to kill all the male children and kill all the non-virgin females. Moses then said that the remaining female children could be taken as sexual slaves.And people think Islam is a religion of violence?  So, explain this passage but here is the catch: you cannot say every word in the bible must be taken literally but then write off passages like this as ""parables"" meant to teach us some other lesson.I will never try to tell someone that there is or isn't a God or tell them what to believe, that is a personal choice and I respect those who make that choice. But why not respect others for making their own choices? When one sect of Christianity tells me that members of other Christian sects cannot enter heaven, it is clear that many Christians do not espouse the principles of their own faith.  When one sees a person treat their fellow humans like dirt six days a week but go to church on Sunday and have a ""What Would Jesus Do"" license plate frame, I have nothing but disgust.And do not forget that the text of the ten commandments are also found, almost word for word, in the Qur'an.

You said that a homosexual could get married, just not to someone of the same sex. This means that if they want to marry the have to marry someone they don't want to. Now lets take the religion out of this, why should we change the definition of marriage for a select few?You want to take religion out of it? It's about time.Marriage is a social construct. That means it was created by people, and as such it is in our power to change it. We now know that not everyone is born heterosexual, but in fact many people are born homosexual. If marriage is defined as between only a man and a woman, these people are excluded from starting a family of their own. In addition, homosexuals make up more than ""a select few"" and therefore it affects millions of people in the U.S. At the same time, extending the definition of marriage to include homosexuals, would have absolutely no effect on the marriage of straight couples. In this sense marriage isn't being changed at all. Homosexuals should be allowed to marry because love knows no gender.Give me a reason why homosexuals should raise children. And I'm tired of hearing about that friend of yours, give me an actual reason. You are the one who wants change you should have to answer my question first.Actually, in most places it was not illegal for homosexual couples to adopt. Then people started making laws against it. These laws were declared unconstitutional, but people then passed amendments. In this sense you are wrong about me wanting the change, however, I will still back up my point.Homosexuals should be allowed to adopt because they have been shown to be equally capable parents through numerous studies source. Therefore, homosexual parents would be a great group of people to adopt orphans, and therefore there would be less foster children. In addition, people should have the right to raise a family. Since no harm is done by homosexual parenting, there is no reason to outlaw adoption by homosexuals.Jake you claim that you do not ""take everything from the bible literally and blindly""? and yet you still fail to give me reasons why homosexuality is wrong that are not religious. I can only interpret this to mean you have no reasons. Therefore you are forcing your religion on others.

1574	gayRights	Hi SocialistBetty,Thank you so much for your question.  I do not think that Christ would have reacted in a negative way to a gay person sharing His message as long as this person does not act on his/her tendencyÑsame sex attraction.  All of us have tendencies and struggles; this is the reason why Christ died on the cross for us.I believe that individuals are more than just their sexuality  and no one should be defined and/or valued based only on a sexual tendency. What  about their character, talents,  interests, love for Christ and other people, etc., etc. I want to share this article which explain what I would like to tell you.Written by: Mike Ensley | March 6th, 2008 The answer that immediately comes to mind is, ÒWell, yeah!Ó We know God loves everybody, but then weÕre confused when we see Bible verses that say homosexuality is a sin. What does that mean for gays?LetÕs ask ourselves: does God think the way we do? Not quite (Isaiah 55:9). So I wonder if God would even think of people as ÒgayÓ or ÒstraightÓ in the first place? Like the verse linked to above says, GodÕs ways are much higher than ours. You know, the Bible really never classifies people as ÒgayÓ or ÒhomosexualÓ (even though some translations make it seem that way). The Scriptures only ever talk about homosexuality being a kind of behaviorÐnot a kind of person.So itÕs more accurate to say that, rather than seeing people as Ògay,Ó God just sees peopleÐsome of whom have same-sex attractions, and others who have different struggles. And He loves them all. The only question is whether we are willing to daily make an effort in faith to submit our ground-level ways to His heavenly ones .No matter what your struggle looks like, though, it doesnÕt have to dictate your identity, actions or destiny. A big part of starting this journey is learning to stop thinking the way the crowd thinks, to stop believing everything youÕre told just because itÕs popular opinion.DonÕt copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know GodÕs will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.

The common idea at the time (or at least rationalization) was that women would vote the same as their husbands so their right to vote was irrelevant. This idea seems archaic to us today, but back then it was the accepted norm. Progress eventually won out and woman gained the right that is most necessary to a democracy: the right to vote.In both of these cases we can see how the status quo seems fine to a large number of people because it is what they are used to. Others though, see that there is an injustice occurring, and step up to fix it. I believe this explains why so many oppose gay marriage more than anything else. It is what has always been, why change it. I know you are a conservative, so know that I mean no offense when I say that conservative viewpoints have stood in the way of positive change throughout history. It is not bigotry that kept allowed slavery to continue (although that played a role) it is inaction and complacency.Now we see the same scenario repeated. A group has been denied certain rights and now they are asking for them. You used the word militant, and I have to disagree with its connotations. African Americans were called militant when they demanded civil rights during the 60's, were they just being greedy? Or were they standing up and demanding that they be given what was promised to them as children: that all men are created equal, no different from our founding fathers who stood up during the revolution and demanded their rights. No different then now, where a group of people want to have their love recognized under the law. They want to be part of a nation that allows the pursuit of happiness. I think that your right on one count, that is human nature. It is human nature to want acceptance, and to want equality, and to want a chance at the happiness that everyone else takes for granted.I hope you see why I am upset at those people who prevent these people from the happiness they seek, and why I call them bigots. There crime is all too common, an inability to put yourself in your neighbors shoes. An inability to recognize the humanity of others. An inability to empathize with their suffering in a society that does not fully accept them."	FAVOR
1581	gayRights	Ever heard of separation of church and state? It was originally made to keep the state out of the church... No religious institution should be forced to do anything. Religious institutions are supposed to be houses of freedom from cynical, politically correct, immoral, and oppressive natures of society (and i'm not saying this because i'm a regular church-goer.

1587	gayRights	The fact that   kids   are better off with both a   mom   and a dad is questionable, simply because it is a correlation. Sure, kids are better off with two parents. They can appeal to a different parent if one is being unreasonable and there are more people to love them and look out for their well being. Single parents can't pay nearly as much attention to their   children   (I'm not saying that single parents don't still raise fine children) because they have to be the sole bread winner, and depending on which parent was killed, they might not have all of the   college     education   or job skills necessary to find as good as a job. Kids who are grieving are also more likely to be angry, withdrawn, and rebel. This is not any fault of the parent. Kids who are raised by   gay   parents do just as well being raised by two parents of the same gender. I honestly don't think that a child needs to be raised by two parents of the opposite sex. Two gay men might be hard pressed to raise a daughter, but they would do their best, and as long as they were loving and patient, there's no reason that the daughter wouldn't become a valuable member of   society  . All in all, a child just needs parents. Married couples also have a lot easier of a time   adopting  , and I would find it hard to believe that a child would honestly be better off in the foster care system than in a loving home being raised by two parents, regardless of gender.

So then, matrimony must be in line with our religious beliefs at some level.  But even if we could widen the net and make a definition of marriage that is conciliatory with every religion, what about those people who have no religion?  I hope we agree that the government cannot impress religious dogma or interfere with the religious reestablishmentÑbut if an idea cannot be rationalized through anything other than religious, then it might as well be religious dogma, and therefore it cannot be imposed on the People.  Would the Protestants be happy if Catholics prohibited meat on Lenten Fridays?  What if Christians prohibited Muslim girls from wearing a headdress?What exactly is the Òfundamental sexual complementariness of male and femaleÓ?  Now, I understand that the penis fits quite nicely into the vagina, and that copulation is usually effective for producing children.  And I would not think it unreasonable that this is the product of   evolution  , or the hand of God.  Yet, these design elements serve to carry on the human raceÑto say that man and woman should be together just because their genitals say they should is reading morality from an irrelevant biological function.  Marriage is about love and happiness, and the only way the idea of gender complementariness could dictate marriage is if marriage was meant to produce children.  I know some people believe that is a purpose to marriage, but this wouldnÕt be America if the government dictated what kind of marriage even heterosexual people should have.	FAVOR

1594	gayRights	There you go again. I disagree with you, so i'm a bigot. If someone thinks anyone who disagrees with them is a bigot, what does that make them? (I'll give you a hint, it's a word you just used)The irony is that I honestly didn't give a damn about gay marriage before activists started to attack everyone who disagreed with them. My little sister was afraid to go to school for 3 weeks during the prop 8 vote. I think the problem is that the gay community thinks that discrimination is having people think they're doing something wrong, and that's simply not discrimination. The entire issue of gay marriage is centered around the idea that you want everyone not just to tolerated you, but to tell you what you're doing is ok, and if this doesn't happen, it's discrimination to you.Once again that is the decleration of independence by the way. Life liberty and pursuit of happiness. No one can show me in the CONSTITUTION where it guarantees the right to marry, and that include the tyrannical judges who base their decision based on what they think should be instead of what the law is. You know what that's called, when 7-9 judges (or really 4 or 5, since it's never been more than a simple majority) go against the constitutiont to pass a law they think is right? That's called tyranny. Do you support tyranny? What if it wasn't in your favor? What if those judges said gays should be burned? That's why there are checks and balances. I think the real problem here comes to two points that will always divide this arguement.1) you believe homosexuality is like race: something someone is born with and has no control over. The opposing side believes it is action realted, because someone is not gay, somone is living a gay lifestyle. The problem is a word symantics one. If you define gay as attracted to members of the same sex, than it's a moot point, because that person is not limited in any way. But if being gay is having a relationship with a member of the same sex, than it has become an action, and thus is not afforded any special protection because it is action-oriented. All of this is moot in my opinion because no matter what you still have all the same rights as straight people, but your arguement rests on it entirely.2) Marrying whomever you love is a basic right. This just isn't true. If it was, than what about pedophiles. Studies show many of them are born with these feelings. What about serial killers? We know they're born that way. Obviously these are extreme examples and gays and serial killers are in no way alike, but I use them as examples to show that this arguement cannot stand up legally. And besides, it's just not in the constitution.I am not a bigot. 90% of my friends are gay, and they're my very best friends. If you can pass a law that gives you the right to marry I am all for it. I may even vote for it if people ask me nicely instead of yelling at me. But I have been opposed for over 10 years to people manipulating courts to get their legistlature through.I know you think it's a right in the constitution, or you think it should be. It's not, so make it one! This vote failed, but not for long. By the time my generation is completely in charge, it will be legal the right way. So hope for that instead of bringing down our country's established system with judicial legislation (as if it could sink any lower).	AGAINST

You can't exercise force against peoples choices or choose for them.The church has failed hugely by trying to use force instead of winning minds and hearts to upholding it's treasured values. The values upheld by people in the church often become those specific of their choice, and because (same sex issues may be upheld to their values by them) but maybe not financial integrity.

The new study by two University of Southern California sociologists says children with lesbian or gay parents show more empathy for social diversity, are less confined by gender stereotypes, and are probably more likely to explore homosexual activity themselves. Writing in recent issue of the American Sociological Review, the authors say that the emotional health of the two sets of children is essentially the same. Leaders of national gay-affirming groups said they welcomed the article, according to an Associated Press story. ""I'm thrilled that they're tackling these issues,"" said Aimee Gelnaw, executive director of the Family Pride Coalition, who is a lesbian parent raising two children with her partner.

Openness to Gay RelationshipsMet With ""Elation""Kate Kendall, head of the San Francisco-based National Center for Lesbian Rights, also is raising two children with her partner. ""There's only one response to a study that children raised by lesbian and gay parents may be somewhat more likely to reject notions of rigid sexual orientation -- that response has to be elation,"" Kendall said. But Amy Desai, a policy analyst with the group Focus on the Family, said the new report is alarming in its suggestions that children of gay parents might be more open to homosexual activity. ""Kids do best when they have a married mother and a married father,"" she said. A Home With No Dad is Better?The study's co-author, Judith Stacey, is a professor of contemporary gender studies. In addition to pointing out the gender differences in the two groups of children, she states that there are in fact some advantages to an all-female parental team without Dad living in the home: a female couple tends to be more involved in the children's lives and is in greater harmony in terms of parenting approaches. Among the findings cited by the authors: 1. Compared to the daughters of heterosexual mothers, the daughters of lesbians more frequently dress, play and behave in ways that do not conform to sex-typed cultural norms. They show greater interest in activities with both masculine and feminine qualities. They have higher aspirations to occupations that are not traditionally female. 2. In terms of aggression and play, sons of lesbians behave in less traditionally masculine ways. They are likely to be more nurturing and affectionate than their counterparts in heterosexual families. 3. One study examined by the researchers indicated that a significantly greater proportion of young adult children raised by lesbians had engaged in a same-sex relationship (six of 25 interviewed) than those raised by a heterosexual mother (none of 20 interviewed). 4. Those raised by lesbian mothers were also more likely to consider a homosexual relationship. 5. Teen-age and young adult girls raised by lesbian mothers appear to be more sexually adventurous and less chaste than girls raised by heterosexual mothers. Sons, on the other hand, were somewhat less sexually adventurous and more chaste than boys raised by heterosexuals. 6. The studies indicate that sexual orientation has no measurable effect on the quality of parent-child relationships or on the mental health of children. ""These studies find no significant differences between children of lesbian and heterosexual mothers in anxiety, depression, self-esteem and numerous other measures of social and psychological adjustment,"" said the authors. NARTH""s Joseph Nicolosi offered the following comments: ""This paper was authored by a professor of gender studies, so it is not surprisingly that the differences on which she focused have to do with a rejection of gender conformity. Indeed, what she found makes sense -- lesbian mothers tend to have a feminizing effect on their sons, and a masculinizing effect on their daughters. ""But the question is, are these differences healthy? More research is needed to understand how a rejection of conventional gender roles can have not just a healthy and expansive, but also a constricting and negative effect on identity and psychological health. ""And despite what many gender researchers claim, research tells us that the absence of a father in the home is not, on balance, good for families.""

If the entire sample field is questioned in an STD clinic or doctors surgery, is it maybe conceivable that a large proportion would have STD's? Why else would they be there in the first place?

1625	gayRights	There's not really a specific   gay     gene  , but there are links. First of all, the gene for fay men is usually passed down through the mother. Mothers who have gay uncles or cousins are more likely to have a gay child. The more sons a mother has, the more likely another son is to be gay. This has to do with an immune system response. Prenatal hormones also have a huge effect. If a girl   baby   has abnormal levels of testosterone in her blood, she will be more likely to be gay. So... There's not necessarily a gay gene, it's more of an environmental thing. People are still born gay, however, and they don't have a choice in the matter.

I've taken biology, anatomy and physiology, and a major's worth of psychology classes, and done as well as the males. Science classes are a prerequisite, and women and men are passing them equally. So, since they show the same aptitude for the same subjects on the lower levels, something must be stepping in to select for a career in the sciences.I read an account by a female scientist with two email accounts, one with her initials, one with her name. Colleagues assumed the account with the initials was male and kept that account in the loop with news and rumors; they ignored the one with her first name on it. It wasn't that they didn't like or know her; they didn't like or know the other account either. That's one example of how your career as a scientist is defined by passive discrimination in a publish-or-perish field where your colleagues are all-important. I'm sure how you can see a similar effect might chip in at the grad student level. So if I had a college-age daughter, I would tell her that she could succeed just like the men, but she could expect people telling her that she couldn't do it and trying to undercut her.I also have to argue with your use of ""traditional"" marriage. I know I bring up the Victorians a lot, but go read ""Oliver Twist."" Maybe just the first few chapters. Adults starved and jailed and beat tiny children in the Victorian era and thought nothing of it; children weren't the purpose of marriage, as people claim now. Marriage was all about social and economic stability. Children were just a side result and you only needed one male to survive to be your heir and social bargaining chip. (It's in the Bible; children are not treasure, but a ""quiver full"" of arrows.) Today's view of children as all-important is a modern luxury, not a traditional function.In my view, Western marriage evolved from ""one man with as many wives as he could afford"" to ""one man with one wife whose property he owned"" to ""one man and woman who could keep her property"" to ""one man and one woman who could divorce him and still keep custody."" Marriages also shifted from arranged to love matches. And homosexual marriage was around for the British and French in the early Middle Ages, the Picts, and the Romans until it was banned as a political move.

This is usually legally stronger than marriage vows as contracts are often added to marriages to clarify the terms. I agree that a person doesn't Choose who they fall in love with, but they do choose to act on it. There are alot of gay people out there who have chosen to be in heterosexual relationships for reasons of their own, just as someone else has chosen to go with their desires and follow the path they feel is right for them. Living in a gay relationship is definitely a choice. If a person buys his house knowing he is beside the airport, should he be listened to when he complains about the noise.

I also find quite naive and absurdthis this assertion that because we are all male we are locked in a certain mode of uniform thinking, that we have the same way of seeing, analyzing and doing things. I differ with a lot of men in seeing and doing things and incidentally a lot of my thinking and behaviour is inline with that of numeous women, which is just a coincidence because I differ with a lot of women in my thinking and doing in just about the same measure.

No thoughtful person would conclude that heterosexuality is wrong based on Bible passages about rape.Just so, no thoughtful person would conclude that committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships are wrong based on a Bible passage about idolatry and shrine prostitution (Romans 1). When pagans engage in same sex activity to worship the fertility goddess, that cultic activity never provides an honest basis to condemn committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex relationships.In reality, your conclusion is at odds with the cultural, doctrinal, historical and scriptural context. The context is shrine prostitution - pagan sexual worship of the fertility goddess - not lesbianism and not homosexuality in the sense of loving, committed, faithful, same sex partnerships.      One need not be gay or lesbian to understand that Cybele was THE leading fertility goddess in first century Rome.

It seems that those in opposition are against the state telling the church what to do.I agree with both stances.  So is it therefore logical to no longer commingle church and state activities with legal church-marriages?  That seems like a fine solution to me.Gays just want the rights of marriage, that being state-sanctioning of their marriage which has everything to do with power of attorney, healthcare benefits, and financial death benefits.  Do those who oppose gay marriage really have an issue with those things?  It is not likely (I'm sure there are some yeses) that the majority don't want other people to do as they will.

There are few studies that may indicate otherwise, but one has to look hard and with a strong bias to find such indications. People cannot change the color of their skin; homosexuals can change their behavior. My father is the perfect example. He said he was never truly happy in that lifestyle, not because of the negative attitudes toward homosexuality, but because homosexuality was his attempt to satisfy himself sexually. He came to realize the lifestyle is self-destructive and left it. His only regret was that he didn't leave that lifestyle sooner.	AGAINST

Rather, they have to do with heterosexual people (men, in all but one instance) engaging in practices such as adulterous behavior with another man in their own wife's bed; sexual intercourse and orgies with temple prostitutes in service of false gods; buying and selling of sexual slaves; males raping other males by way of showing conquest and domination.These are most certainly vile and hideous practices.

1669	gayRights	Equal Civil Rights are the most pressing issue.  NO gay-parented family in this nation has the same rights as a straight, married couple and their children.  Even those legally married in MA, CA or CT do not have any of the more than 1000 rights, protections and privileges granted by federal law to married couples.  But worse than this is the fact that many, many gay people live in one of the 30 states which do not have even the most basic of Civil Rights protections for gays, such as the right to not be fired from a job or refused employment because one is gay, or the right not to be denied the purchase or rental of a home because one is gay.  These Civil Rights (or the denial thereof) affect gay-parented families even more than they do gay individuals, because an individual might be presumed to be straight, but a couple with children become extremely obvious to prospective landlords, home sellers or real estate agents.  And employers are not in most places compelled to offer equal access to employer-paid health insurance to the spouses of gay employees.  And if they DO offer such benefits, it is generally not of much benefit, anyway, since gay couples have to pay income taxes on benefits paid for gay spouses as though they were part of the employee's taxable income, making such benefits often as costly or more costly than purchasing health insurance privately.  Since many gay parents cannot form a legal relationship to children adopted by or born to their spouse, they also cannot cover these children as dependents on their employer health insurance.  The children will not be eligible to receive Social Security payments if that parent dies.  And if the biological or adoptive parent dies, the children may lose both parents simultaneously, because they may be taken away from the remaining parent to be placed in foster care with strangers.  There are far too many ways in which gay-parented families are disadvantaged by being denied equal civil rights which are granted as a part of civil marriage to list them all here, or even a tiny fraction of them.  But suffice to say that THESE are the ways in which children of same-gender parents are disadvantaged as compared to children of opposite-gender parents -- not because their parents love them any less or cannot parent them as well as opposite-gender parents.

Using this justification, any religious group that denies gays participation or clergy or marriage will be branded as persecuting homosexuals. The scary thing is that there are some people reading this right now and thinking ""yes, that would be discrimination and homophobia and should be stopped."" I just read a quote:'Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown University law professor and gay activist who helps draft federal legislation related to sexual orientation, says that, when religious liberty conflicts with gay rights, ÒIÕm having a hard time coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.Ó'   (an altogether fetching article which says this entire thing much better than I have)Gay marriage is an immediate threat to our freedoms AS IT IS CURRENTLY being pursued.

Christians   believe that accepting Jesus Christ as God's Son and the forgiveness of their sin by grace (which is free to us, not earned - Jesus Christ died for us because he didn't want us to die for eternity, which is the inevitable consequence of sin) is what enables them to go to heaven.  What we do with grace only proves whether or not we understand and value it.  We will sin at times.  We are not perfect in this life, but we are forgiven, and because we are grateful for that, and with the power that realization gives us, we can choose to   change   how we act and treat others.  Christians acknowledge the damaging effects of sin in our lives and in   society  .  Pretending that each person has the wisdom and rational/impartial judgment to decide what is right and wrong based on their own opinions of their behavior doesn't make sense.  In other words, we would obviously have a strong bias in our own favor.  We believe the definition of sin was put in place by God through the Bible in part to illustrate that we are actually incapable of living up to any real code of conduct on our own because we naturally want sin, and need God in our lives to change those desires.  We are all born with sinful desires but also a desire to be good... but God made a way for us to acknowledge the sinful desires (includes envy, greed, gossip, hate, homosexuality, drunkenness, lying, selfishness, pride, etc.), ask God for forgiveness (because our sin is rebellion to his authority over his creation - us), and commit to changing by the power of Jesus' grace and love.  Jesus' example was to love everyone, and that's my personal standard.  Sometimes I fall short, but Jesus is helping me to do better.  Just because you love someone doesn't mean you have to tell them they are perfect, or that everything they do is good.  Acknowledging sin leads us to the only one who can help, and that is its own reward.  Recognizing sin isn't about judging, it's about offering hope.Not everyone will choose to believe this, but God gave us choice.  If he just forced everyone to do what He wanted there would be no value in our compliance.  I obey because He loves me and I love Him.  Unlike us, he is perfection, but loves us enough to forgive our imperfections. My answer should have been ""SOMETIMES.""

My brother, Michael was a year and a half younger than me. But we were best friends. We did everything together. From the time he was about five I remember people in my family making comments about how  Michael was going to be gay when he grew up. At 5, people could tell. He didn't even know what   sex   or being gay even meant.  To make a long story short, I came home from   school   one day. Michael had stayed home sick. My parents were at work. I walked into the room that we shared together and found my brother, my best friend, hanging from the rafter. He was only 13 and he committed   suicide  . The reason? Well the note he had left on his pillow, which was very obviously stained in his tears, said, and I quote ""I just cant take this life anymore. I have been trying to pretend that I was not gay since I first knew what gay meant. I've tried for years, but I am. Everyone knows it. I hate it. Im afraid people will beat me up or worse. Every morning i cry in the shower knowing I have to go to school again and spend my day being laughed at by girls and insulted by the guys. I wished to God not to be gay.  But God didn't answer. For the few people in my life who know Im gay and still arent disgusted by me, Im sorry if I hurt you. But it hurts too much and gay boys are weaklings. Im 13 and every second of my life is consumed by feelings of guilt, shame, fear, and disgust for myself. The average life span is somewhere in the 70's. That thought of knowing I may have another 60 years of this was just more than I could bare. Mom, dad, and Caleb (that's me) I love you guys and I don't want you guys to have to explain to people that you are related to a fag. I should have done this sooner for you guys..I love you.

1686	gayRights	"""If there's a gene that randomly causes homosexuality in 10% of it's carriers, and it turns out that homosexuality is a benefit to the population as a whole, then evolution applies.""I believe the ""what's good for the group"" model of evolution has been firmly discredited, and is a common misunderstanding of evolutionary behaviour.Firstly, let me address the concept of a gene. What constitues a gene is very subjective, so it is better for us to talk of ""units of evolution"" so we don't confuse ourselves with thinking about genes as a single entity that controls a single operation. Now, in order for homosexuality to be genetic rather than a simple hormone disbalance, we would have to show that there is a significant grouping of genes into a single homosexual unit of evolution, and that this unit of evolution strives to save itself through purely altruistic methods.Now, the general idea of ""what is good for the group"" seems at first to be a possible intepretation of evolution in a larger scale. However, the correct interpretation is what is good for the unit of evolution. Altruistic behaviour appears to be of no benefit to an individual, but obviously the trait to do something altruistic would find it very hard to saturate a gene pool; therefore there is absolutely no benefit in saving another over you. If, however, we think purely at the level of the unit of evolution, then we see that apparently unhelpful behaviours (such as an animal informing other animals of an approaching predetor, whilst also making itself more visible to said predator) can saturate a gene pool if the gene is geared up for saving itself.This means realistically that there are two ways for a unit to saturate the gene pool for a certain unit space; it benefits the individual carrying it, or it causes the individual to benefit other individuals who are most likely carrying the same unit of evolution. As homosexuality lends to a lack of saving ""itself"" (as it wont be passed on), it can only realistically become an evolved trait if it causes altruistic behavior that causes other carriers to be more likely to survive.I know about evolution and I understand all these concepts. The point I'm making is that homosexuality doesn't appear to lend itself to any altruistic behaviour that would benefit people carrying the homosexual unit of evolution. Infact, recognition of other homosexual people in order to better select those to benefit would mean that the other person is also homosexual and therefore less likely to pass on their gene. The main point being made is thus: Altruistic behaviour by a unit of evolution that hunders itself towards units of evolution that also actually hinder their own reproductive potential would be extremely unlikely to saturate the gene pool."

1693	gayRights	I am sorry to say but since the beginning of time the fruit of love between a man and a woman comes out as a child. It is not a question of being for procreation or trying to save the environment through homosexuality. That is way to intellectual of an explanationThe child is from both parents, looks like both parents. The child is in the father and the father is in the child. Same as for the mother. Anyone who go through that experience feels that it is a miracle.For me the issue of homosexuality is wrong. It is no about being different. I do not think that there is a person on the face of the earth who has not stuggled with her or his sexuality. It is not an exclusivity of people dealing with same sex attactions.In my personal beliefs, I do have a reason for this situation. That is not the subject of this post.I do beliefs that men (masculin) and women (feminin) express their love different for their children in a complementary way. We all experience that. Women can see from early age that boys and girls are different.Gender roles are affected by the culture people live in but they are real. People who ignore them suffer a lot in their marriages and learn it the hard way. You can recreate the world to fit you personal views.I think that you are fighting the universe itself, not me.I do not have ill feelings towards homosexuals. It does not mean that I have to agree with you just to please you.On the issue of adoption, it is not on top of the list of the causes celebre like breast cancer or aids and others. The study on the increase in homosexual behaviors if someone was raised in a ss home was made available by focus on the family. I do not have a copy with me. It is available on the web. It does make a lot of common sense since children do imitate what they parents do.  	AGAINST

1695	gayRights	Thanks for the discussion.There are a host of inherent differences, many of which we are only able to specify now with advanced genetic and biological techniques.  Some many blame some of them on society, such as the fact that there just aren't as many women in the hard sciences and engineering as men, even though women make up 55% of the college population.  The differences in how men and women look at the world and evolutionarily have developed is massive, and denying those differences to a child when there is another option is wrong.  While the real world sometimes makes a same-sex couple the best option, removing the ability of society to prefer that optimal partnership for raising children over alternatives is the travesty.The framing of this argument is very important.  One side claims it is one of the last big hurdles to achieving equal rights for homosexuals.  I feel compassion for them and that is a very difficult decision.  The other side, though, doesn't get their frame heard in the media.  I am not against same-sex marriage, per se, but FOR traditional marriage and holding it up as the optimal situation in society.  If society can no longer prefer traditional marriage over any other form, be it same-sex marriage or polygamy, etc, society can no longer prefer the optimal situation for raising children.I appreciate the discussion.John Haidt, a Social Psychology PHD, has a great lecture on TED about the moral differences between Left and Right.  It may help to shed some light on the place that half of Americans come from.  In the end, it is all a framing issue, and having both frames understood is extremely important.      /talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html	AGAINST

It pops up in the people who walk by and ignore one person physically hurting another person. "".  I disagree.  ""Live and Let Live"" does not preclude stopping one person from hurting another.  There is no moral law that says one must tolerate gross immorality.  ""Live and Let Live"" is a universal principle, not just my personal one.  It applies not just to myself, but to other as well.  When I accept it as my principle, I acknowledge that EVERYONE has the right to ""Live"", as well as the responsibility to ""Let Live"".  If someone harms another without justification, then they violate the social contract and may be stopped/punished.  Granted, on an individual level, one is not morally REQUIRED to intervene (If one fears for one's own safety, for example), but one is morally PERMITTED to do so.  But on a social level, a civil society is both permitted and required to intervene.  It is for this reason that invading Iraq was a moral thing to do (although not handled particularly well).  But that's another topic.  I reiterate.  If everyone swore the following oath, we would need no other moral law.  ""Everyone has the right to do whatever they want.""

Kids cannot escape either.Kids are hit when they see other parents that consist of male and a female.  Kids at school, once they know the child has same sex parents, will tease and belittle them.Kids in most situations do not have someone they can go for comfort and understanding.  Most humans do not have the capacity to express themselves well enough to help themselves, let alone help others, and this has been with us since the beginning of man kind.Kids have enough problems growing without increasing their burden by forcing them into a situation that isn't normal.  The kids end up suffering, and like most family settings, when done wrong,   society   also pays.Have we had a chance to actually see these   children   in homsexual settings?  No!

1705	gayRights	I have no objection to same sex marriage. People should be left alone and be allowed to do whatever they think will make them happy as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.I do, however, strongly oppose adoption by same sex couples. In that case, you're taking a unique individual and placing that individual in a situation in which they have no say in the matter.I'll put this question to those with an opposing view: How many of you have ever regretted NOT being raised by a same sex couple? If you were making the choice for yourself, is it what you would have chosen?My parents were divorced when I was 7. There were many times growing up I wished they had stayed together. Never once growing up did it even cross my mind to wish either would find a member of their own sex so the two could raise me together. In fact, I wasn't all that crazy about most of their opposite sex partners.With that said, the greatest advantage comes from growing up in a loving home, with the two people who gave you life in the first place. Anything else is a disadvantage by definition. From there, the argument becomes one of assiging a value to the degree of disadvantage. That's no easy task and involves infinite shades of gray.Never the less, if it's possible to identify the best solution, it should also be possible to say the farther alternate and lesser solutions deviate from the ideal model, the greater the resulting disadvantage.You can say society should be more accepting of alternate lifestyles, and no doubt it should. That does not change the fact that it does not. You can say a child's peers shouldn't haze them for being part of an alternate lifestyle, and no doubt they should not. That doesn't change the fact that they do.It is irrefutable that it is only possible to produce children through heterosexual means. Millions of years of   evolution   has defined heterosexuality as having the highest advantage for every life form higher than bacteria. In the game of survival of the fittest, that's what works best. A child raised with the tools to form a lasting bond with members of the opposite sex has the greatest advantage, by the only definition that matters. It is what works best in terms of both survival of the individual and of the species.	AGAINST

But, Periannath, there is an obvious question that lots of people will be asking you right now - ""Do you eat pork?""If the answer is positive, should you not then admit that something certainly has changed between the Old and New Testaments? Also, is it is vital for you as a teacher to find out what that thing is?I, like you, believe in the inspiration of Holy Scripture. But I also see something dramtic happening at Pentecost, when God's people were placed under a new covenant, and released from the ""tutors and govenors"" of the Mosaic Law (Galations 4v1-5).In Acts 15, the apostles acted decisively against a ""sect of the Pharisees who had believed, saying that it was needful to circumcise them (Christians), and to command them to keep the Law of Moses."" (V5) I have the whole weight of New Testament scripture behind me when I say that Christians no longer need to keep the Mosaic Law.So how then does any Christian explain Jesus' words in Matthew 5v17-20. For me, the answer lies in verse 19, and the phrase, ""the least of these commandments,"" because Jesus wasn't actually referring directly to the Law of Moses with this phrase. Instead, he was referring to the commandments that he was about to utter-  v22, v28, v34, v40, v44; Chapter 6v3, v7, v14, 20, 25; Chapter 7v1. Finally, Jesus sums up the morality that underpins the Mosaic Law, by saying-""So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."" (Chapter 7v12)Jesus didn't come to ""destroy"" the Mosaic Law- that is certain. He came to ensure that the morality that underpins that Law is fulfilled in the believers life. And what is that morality? I have just quoted what Jesus taught about that morality. It correlated exactly with the ""Royal Law"" - ""Love you neighbour as yourself.""How do you think that I break this Royal Law?Lots of love,gaychristian"	FAVOR

The lack of a clear and agreed definition of a word makes it impossible for people to have a reasonable debate on the subject pertaining to that word.Indeed by confusing the meaning of the word ""marriage"", it makes it impossible for people to rationally discuss it.A new word or phrase should be chosen so as not to do harm to the existing meaning of words, while at the same time recognizing the essential characteristics of what is to be described by the word or phrase.The new practice of what may be called a ""homosexual union"" is new, because it carries with it recognition under the law, which is unprecedented. But separate from whatever legal definitions may be ascribed to it, the failure to adequately name the practice does harm to the established language and its meaning.In particular, the practice of calling this ""gay marriage"" does harm both to the word ""gay"", and to the word ""marriage"", both of which have established meanings in language, and are widely used. Indeed the word ""marriage"" has no synonym which can be used in its place, unlike the word ""gay"" which can be replaced in usage by the word ""happy""; So the destruction or redefinition of the word ""marriage"" is hurtful to the language in a way that can not be easily mended.It is precisely the confusion over the definition of the words which has caused so much apparent disagreement which could have been avoided with adequate clarity and agreement over the definitions of the words which they are arguing over.In conclusion, the phrase ""gay marriage"" hurts users of language by confusing the established meaning of words, making rational discussion impossible. The phrase ""gay marriage"" is describing something new in that it claims legal status. Therefore, one should pick another set of words that do not harm the established meaning of words in use. In particular, the word ""marriage"" has an established meaning, and cannot be easily replaced. The phrase should instead be ""homosexual union"" or some other phrase that recognizes the nature of the relationship, while at the same time not doing harm to the long established meaning of the word ""marriage"".

You think he would talk about two men in response to this question?  Or two women?  Ridiculous.He went on, though, later in that same chapter, to discuss ""Eunuchs who were born that way,"" which many scholars believe was a common manner of referring to men who did not prefer to have sexual relations with women.

1735	gayRights	For background's sake. I was raised a Christian and my credentials are excellent. I am very well versed on the 10 commandments, old and new testament, as well as most things Christian. My family has many members who have devoted their lives to serve their   religion   and are placed very highly in the Church. Now that this is established, please be careful when you attack people for their ignorance. What comes out when you attack like this is that it reveals your ignorance and anger. Clarity of mind only comes when calm. I wanted to comment that although our Western   society   has based its legal system on the Judeo-Christian faiths, it does not mean that it was right or that it should be so or be imposed on citizens. We live in a world of many belief systems and we cannot choose one   faith   over another. The best choice for civil society is to choose laws based on   tolerance   and respect. Individuals can choose their gods and live by their belief systems at home. No one will impede on those rights. At least it gives an equal chance for everyone to live free from fear.As for God being written into our constitutions and courts of law. I believe it is a grave error. It is a North American and not a European tradition. The French revolution got rid of God in its civil society to create a clear separation of church and state. The state doe snot have any allegiances other than to its citizens. So to put the debate back to same sex marriages, if one desires to be married to a partner of same sex than by all means please do. You don't have too. That is true freedom. God will one judge you. You are not God so please do not judge others. You are not responsible for the   soul   of others. 	FAVOR

When it is pointed out that Adam and Eve (one man with one woman for life) did NOT indicate God's prohibition of polygamy (notice Genesis 4:19 where the first polygamous marriage occurs and Deuteronomy 21:15 where God makes provision for inheritance in polygamous marriage situations) anti-gay Christians then ping pong back to the clobber passages and opine that it is ""clear"" that God is talking about homosexuality, even though they previously admitted that the context is shrine prostitution, NOT a committed, faithful, non-cultic same sex partnership.Ah, the joys of debating the Bible with the brethren...Rick Brentlinger    "	FAVOR

1741	gayRights	 I was very active in the gay comminity for 14 years. There was 4 years I didn't care who I took home from the gay bars.I marched in the gay pride parade, I attended Metropolitian Community Church In time their sunday school department asked me to teach some of their kids. During thids time I met a woman who was willing to help me in the gay sunday school class. Our relationship lasted nine years. We even had the gay marriage. I thought I had the best of everything I could worship God in a gay church, teach kids about Jesus, and love a woman. While I taught SUnday School at the gay church, I asked God to remove my alcohol problem that I had. He took the desire to drink away from me. Later  my lover and I moved from Ca. to Ill. We told the  church we attended we were just sisters. After attending a Louis Palau Cursade in the early '90's, my partner told me she thought our relationship was wrong in God' eyes. I was really taken by surprise,and didn't know what to do. She made plans to move out. I had a choice, but going back to the bars would have been like dying. In my belief that God is bigger than me I began reading the Bible, and asking Him for help.  I met Jesus at the well, in John 4-The Samaritian Woman. I continued to read and seek God's will, I came to the conclusion that homosexuality was a sin in God's eyes, and I asked him to remove it from me, and I repented of my sinful ways. There was peace and healing when I let God be in control. All of us have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God, only when we repent of the sin and ask God for forgiveness can we have peace. In 1 Corinthians 6 there are a list of things that God calls sin. There is also hope, because that is what some of us were. 	AGAINST

In Jesus Christ a new word is spoken, a word of freedom, a word of healing, a word of restoration, a word that calls us back to move forward, to become who we already are in the dreams and love of God.  It is not a freedom that permits sin but rather frees us from it to be the people of God, the people of the church, followers of Christ, Christians.  Thank God I have found this freedom.

The usual objections to homosexual marriage is from a religious point of view, not one of protecting individual rights and liberties. Government recognition of marriage has nothing at all to do with religion and everything to do with social contracts. Turning every existing marriage, at least for legal purposes, into a civil union removes any religious prejudices. It becomes mere legal recognition of a voluntary union of two or more human beings. This last part I say because objections to marriages of more than two individuals are also religiously motivated and has nothing at all to do with legal protections of individual rights.""Sanctity of marriage"" is tribalism that must not be tolerated in a culture that purportedly values individual rights and liberties above all else. Tribalism is socialism is communism is, in any event, contrary to the nature of all life which is to seek its own way in the interest of its own survival and happiness. Civilization merely inserts the proviso that one can have all of that provided one allows the same for others. Marriage traditionalists wish to establish and maintain and members-only club.As I pointed out, they may perhaps prevent recognition of homosexual marriages among themselves, however, homosexuals genuinely desiring marriage to another or others will find a way to do so regardless of irrational barriers to official sanction. In any event, a true marriage is an emotional bond - not an administrative status - of which no one can prevent or dissolve except those involved in the relationship. This is why it is true there are authentic marriages without official sanction and officially sanctioned marriages that are an emotional fraud. Human beings must and, I believe, will progress to a more genuine kind of marriage much less focused if at all on official sanction, i.e., official marriage or even civil union, and more importantly focused on the existence or non-existence of emotional bonding.It is the only kind of marriage that genuinely matters.

1764	gayRights	"Dear friend, peace to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.I write to you to convince you of the soundness of the Word of God from its begining to its end beacause it is the word of life and sound truth from God for all men.  ""All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."" (2 Timothy 3:16,17 NIV).  Remember that when this was written to Timothy the only cannonized Scripture available was the Hebrew Tanak and Torah, or Law.  The Apostle Paul clearly considered it inspiried and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteiousness... and so on.  Furthermore, Jesus himself said he did not come to abolish the law but to fufill it.  ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them.  I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.  Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practises and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven."" (Matthew 5:17-20, NIV).  Jesus didn't do away with the law but rather fufilled it.  There could be a whole sermon on this but it speaks for itself that the law is not done away with.  As believers in Christ you are right in saying that we are no longer judged by the law but that is not because it is not relavent or useful, but like the Apostle Paul said it is useful and to the Romans wrote: ""So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good. Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful."" (Romans 6:12-13, NIV).  The law still reveals what is sinful and as a Christ follower it is not ok to keep on sinning.  THe reality that we live by the Royal law, or the Law of the Spirit of life is that we are free from our sinful nature to yield and follow the Spirit of God who leads us into the way of righteousness, which the Law (Mosaic) defines.  We are not saved by or through the law but by grace through faith but faith is demonstrated in obeidienace and obeidience to God is done through obeying his law.  Jesus said ""If you love me you will obey my commands.""  And remember, Jesus didn't nulify or do away with any of God's law (as given through Moses) but rather fufilled it.  The commands in both the Old and New testaments (covenenents) against the practice of homosexuality are still binding for Christ followers as they were in the beginging of the church.  The good news is that Jesus frees us from our sinful nature and gives us the power through the Spirit of God to put to death the misdeeds of the body and live by the Spirit.  Those who live according to the sinful nature reep death but those who live according to the Spirit, by his power (that is God does it) reep eternal life.  Peace to you, and may the peace of Christ come into every area of the life and convict you of your need for God's help in restoring your whole person and sexuality.  God loves you!"	AGAINST

Nobody can argue that  foster care or an orphanage is better than a loving home, whether the parents are straight, gay, black, white, religious atheist or anything else.They also argue that divorce is bad for children.  No kidding!  Again, that has no bearing on the argument.  Since we won't let same sex partners marry they can't possibly get divorced.

For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.  And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed."" (Genesis 2:22-25, NASB)  Here we see that the one flesh union (which is sexual union, 1 Co 6:16) has an intrinsic desgin between the one man and one woman.  This also is the design and beginning of marriage for we see that they are now husband and wife.  No marriage in Scripture is never anything but heterosexual and although at times polegomy is practiced by peoople in the Bible that does not mean it is God's favor.  We see here from the begining and from the teachings of Jesus and the church that clearly practices were tolerated because of hardness of heart, not because God favored them.  As for complementarianism, it is supported by St. Paul- or should we accuse him of basing his view off of Plato too?  ""For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man; for indeed man was not created for the woman's sake, but woman for the man's sake."" (1 Corinthians 11:8-9, NASB)Also notice that prior to woman being taken from man man is always reffered to as Hb. Adam, man as in mankind, human kind.  However, as the man declairs that woman is taken from man he no longer uses the word Adam, as Adam no longer sufices as a description of himself becasue he is no mankind in this sense without woman who is taken from him, he is (Hb.)'iysh, that is, man, male, husband, servant in contrast to the female.  Earlier in the first chapter we can also see that marraige is connected to procreation (which is obviosly not possible in a homosexual context).  Plato and the Bible actually agree on one point, homosexuality is against nature as it is against God's created design both for marraige and for the nature of marraige which is built in the complentary aspects of the male and female, masculine and femminine.  argument 2: God doesn't mention in Scripture that he will only bless heterosexual marriages. Actually it does.  Since marriage by nature is heterosexual and God only blesses sexual union in the context of marriage this is taken for granted.  In any case, where does it say he will bless a homosexual union?  It doesn't, rather He calls it an abomination (not a blessing).  "	AGAINST

It is absurd that a very small group of people thinks that because the misinterpreted what the Constitution provides, that they can change history over night.  By the way, this is not one of them.  Marriage has always been and should never be changed from between man and woman.  This is natural.  During hard times in our history, with the lack of a partner of the opposite sex, genders have come together for the comfort and contact experienced from birth.  It helps keep us sane: humans need contact.  But to make this as ligitimate as mariage between a man and a woman is naive, arrogant, selfish.  	AGAINST

1780	gayRights	"to often persons attempt to consider procreation as the only reasonable assertion to prove that homosexuality is genetically a ""dead end"".  to make your investigation on this topic quick and easy, read last months Scientific American, that issue was completely devoted to the topic of   evolution  .  you will find a broad group of disscussions which cover topics of the multiple ways that genetics of a species are fortified for continuation....not all being limited to mere procreation.  for one, there is the success of the population being aided by ""unselfish"" genes....these are traits held by individuals of a group that tend to make the group in which they live survive better than those without them.  studies (they are cited here....do your homework yourself) show that even though individuals have a trait not shared by all which can save the group, those populations which gave rise to them not only just survive, but tend to create larger numbers of those with the ""unselfish"" genes in there future populations, beyond those created by those who have already expressed the gene.many species survive as a result of the variable genetics of it's population at a given time.  one could quite easily say (merely as conjecture) that gay persons assist the community without the ""expense"" of having added another mouth to feed to compete for resources.  Since there has been nearly no protracted period in our evolutionary history where resources have NOT been often strained, this little example alone is enough to give substantial reason for gay persons to exist.  A gay person would work, be able to share in the groups defense, could kill more bison or harvest more grain than he or she would consume and thus assist in the survival of the group.  here...any group which created gay persons would perhaps out survive one where there were none or....to be fair one where the entire population was gay (a certain and only example of a genetic ""dead end"").in addition, regarding the gay vrs. straight ratio;  there are thousands of papers which have been written that put the population of persons that are born slightly to severely hermaphodidic at about 11%.  the now defunct magazine THE SCIENCES by the New York Academy of Science had a very major article which disscussed that before the surgical technology to ""correct"" elements of hermaphadism in children existed, this population had to be counciled as to how to get through our society.  the regularity of this was well documented and was readily a part of psychiatric training. the narrow man/woman catagories we often argue about are just a portion of the human reality.It is only in the human mind that ""this"" or ""that"" exists.  nature attempts and continually demonstrates that nearly everything is on the table at all times.  and it is in the fact that the ratio of homosexual to heterosexual is pretty much a heterogeneous ratio across all societies (when verified to account for societal suppression of admition of homosexuality) that shows that it is a genetic creation, and one that the species has found to be of bennifit eons before culture existed as we now experience it."

History cannot be the interpriter of God's word any more than God's word can be the intrepriter of history.   They are separate and distinct and both, while valuable, have nothing to do with one another, at least secular history.  God's word is inspired; history is not.

1792	gayRights	"     Lets first start with a working and shared definintion of ""rational."" Rational: ""Having or exercising the ability to reason.  Consistent with or based on reason; logical: rational behavior."" (American Heritage Dictionary)     You ask where I am getting my info; where are you getting yours?  There is some controversy as to whether   animals   are capable of rational throught, however, the vast majority of people including scientists do accept an animal as a rational creature.  For example, recently there was a women in CA who had a   pet   chimp.  Without warning and without rational basis the chimp went ""ape"" on her girl friend and almost killed her.  Professionals in the field, including zoologists, vets, other biologits etc. often reference that these types of things happen because they are ""wild animals.""  To expect rational behavior from an animal is absurd.       Furthermore, from a Biblical point of view, regardless of how literaly one interpreates the   creation   accounts there is a clear distinction between man and the animals.  Namely they alone were made in the image and likeness of God, recieved from a him a rational that is in likeness to him (which animals do not) and were given dominion over the earth (including the animal kingdomm).       Philosophically we can know that animals are not capable of considering sylogistic reasoning, understand logic.  A dog does not think about where it would go to   college   or what it wants to do with its life.  The earliest philosophers and through the present age have noticed a distinction from animals and humankind.  To argue that because an animal does something means it is ok for humans is ludicrist.  Animals eat there own kind, commit acts of aggression including   murder   and many other atrocious behavior if we tried to understand this rationaly.   However, we know that they are animals and they do that kind of thing based on instict and conditioning.  Yes Leviticus is Old Testements.  Leviticus is not just a rule book for Hebrew males it was given to the whole people of Israel as with the rest of the Torah.

1794	gayRights	In my experience people who have feelings for the same or opposite sex often wish they did not.

There are men who just find other men more attractive even whilst they fear what their friends will say. They just dont find women attarctive enough.

The   law  , public opinion, persecution or persuasion are as unlikely to change sexual inclination as preventing drug or   alcohol   use.

1817	gayRights	Since children for the last few thousand years have been a key aspect of carrying on the bloodlines, holding onto the property in the family, and providing much needed extra hands and income, its fairly logical.  I'm rather surprised that you even challenge the assertion that children are a main reason for traditional marriage throughout history, I'd be glad to look up some research at a later date.Adoption agencies, for example, and sperm/egg banks are private agencies, but that doesn't mean they are not regulated.  Massachusetts is a famous example of a Catholic adoption agency that, because of the same-sex ruling by the judges by fiat over the will of the people there, cannot prefer a traditional married couple to a same-sex one.  While I disagree with the agency for shutting down at that point, I am strongly opposed to the government forcing that upon a religion, which is happening and will continue to happen as the government forces same-sex marriage on society.  If it were a laissez-faire, that'd be one thing, but the government recognizing it overrules religious beliefs (so much for separation of church and state) and forces everyone to abide by its rulings.Same-sex marriage being exactly the same in status in society forces society to accept the falsity that men and women are the same.  If two moms or dads is just as good (because, remember, we can no longer prefer a traditional couple to a same-sex one or refuse based on our beliefs to give eggs, etc, from a bank) as a mom and a dad for children, then having two dads MUST give children all of the same benefits of a mom and a dad.

The particular historical context of Romans 1:26-27 is shrine prostitution, not committed, faithful, same sex partnerships. In the first century AD, the Cybele cult was one of the most powerful in the Roman Empire. Cybele worship included orgiastic sexual rites and ritual bloodletting by priests and priestesses, similar to the practice of Baal worshipers in the Old Testament. ÒAnd they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.Ó I Kings 18:28. In first century Rome, religious festivals honoring Cybele were celebrated in one of the five Cybele temples or in the streets. Castrated, long haired priests of Cybele preceded the image of the goddess, beating drums and cymbals, showing off their colorful clothing.   The priests of Cybele were called galli, referring to their castrated eunuch status. Female priestesses and castrated, male eunuch priests functioned as representatives of the goddess, offering themselves sexually to male worshipers. These religious practices flourished in first century Rome and this is what Paul prohibited in Romans 1:26-27.        	FAVOR

It is false that if gay marriage were legal, that would mean that polygamy would be legal.  The reason that polygamy would not be permitted if gay marriage were legal is that polygamy is illegal under separate laws.  I believe you are trying to say that you think that if gay marriage becomes legal, that automatically means that polygamy will become legal.  This is a straw man fallacy, because you have presented no evidence that this is true.  I do not believe any such evidence exists, unless you have the ability to see the future, in which case surely you have something better to do with your time than argue with me :)  Finally, you say ""there is a reason"" that gay marriage is illegal, but you do not specify what it is.  If there is a reason, name it.  Your assertion that the current situation is automatically best because ""thousands of years of human history have evolved to this point"" is laughable.  I'm sorry, but it is.  In the 1940s, thousands of years of human history had evolved to the Holocaust.  Does that mean the Holocaust was good?  The true history of humanity is a tale of ups and downs, of progress and regress.  Humanity has made some serious bad calls, but they seemed like good ideas to the people of the time.

Really what the question at hand is about is whether or not there is a definitive genetic make-up for a gay person that will inevitably lead them to a homosexual lifestyle. I struggle to find this to be even a slightly defensible position.""MY RESPONSE: Hopefully by now you have come to realize (assuming you are familiar with the fable of ""The Blind Men and the Elephant,"" that my analogy is not nearly so nonsensical as you thought.  My point was that, while each of us lands somewhere upon the continuum between ""gay"" and ""straight,"" and cannot change our orientation, still some of us, as a function of where we land, experience sexual attraction as something which is primarily directed towards people of the opposite gender to our own, while some of us experience it as something which is primarily directed towards people of our own gender, and still others experience it as a ""choice"" in that they find themselves attracted to people of either gender.  That being the case, each of us, in relation to the continuum of sexual orientation, is like one of the old blind men in relation to the elephant in the story.  If we land near the the trunk, we believe that an elephant is a lot like a snake.  If we land near the tail, we are certain the elephant is most like a rope, etc.  In the same way, if we are born straight, we most likely assume that anyone who does not manifest heterosexual attractions and behavior is somehow simply a pervert.  If we are born bisexual to one degree or another, we assume that everyone has a choice, since we seem to have a choice, being attracted to one degree or another to people of both genders.  If we are born gay, I think most of us do understand quite clearly that the rest of the world does not easily identify with our sexual orientation, however, we understand their version of sexuality only by what we see in the culture around us, not by our own experience. We are, perhaps, best equipped of any group to understand the reality of others' experience, since we are surrounded by it, can clearly see that it exists and that it is real, and know without a doubt that it does not match our own."

1847	gayRights	All homosexuals, male or female, who would adopt a child, are acting in a manner that is contrary to the nature and consequences of homosexuality. For by reason of their supposed natural, sexual orientation, as they call it, their actions negate the possibility of becoming progenitors as a consequence. Moreover, the homosexual nature also axiomatically negates the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors as parents as well as negating the necessary and natural predisposition of progenitors to place their well-being as secondary and a childÕs primary. However, before they have attempted to adopt a child, all homosexuals have already, in life, demonstrated the predispositional consequences of their sexual orientation which evidence the fact that they cannot put the well-being of anyone before their own subjective well-being. For donÕt all homosexuals act contrary to the heterosexuality of their parents from which, as a consequence, they were born into this world? Moreover, do they not solely seek to please themselves at the expense of the sorrow of their parents and families? So it should be understood that any homosexual male or female who wants to adopt a child is both, acting contrary to his/her sexuality, and is attempting to make the well-being of a child secondary; for homosexuals who want to adopt a child are choosing to do so for themselves and never because a child wants to be raised by homosexual males or females. In conclusion: if adoption is acceptable in a society, the choice as to whom the child can be adopted by must remain the sole authority of the progenitors of the child or relatives and never the public or an institution. For neither the public nor any institution can be held accountable for sorry decisions that ill-affect a child; whereas a parent who gives up itsÕ child for adoption must live with the consequences of that decision and will therefore choose as wisely as is possible in a manner that agrees with the nature of the parent.Homosexual males and females refuse to be parents. And therefore no rational person ought to give their child to a person who is incapable of acting against his or own nature.	AGAINST

The feelings in my heart became a vortex of battling conflicts. I hated his touch and I longed for his touch. I hated liking his attention and I hated not having his attention.Over the next three years, I was forced to bear ""Ray's"" relentless obsession with me. Thankfully, we never had sex. When I finally left the church in disgust, I left home and plunged headlong into the gay lifestyle. The sight of men dancing with each other and publicly kissing made me feel so good. I felt like I was finally in a place where I belonged. In 1980, my first year of   college   I dove headlong into   homosexuality   and all it had to offer. I was new on the gay scene; soon everyone was asking who I was and who I was dating. I went to house parties, orgies, got hooked on ""poppers"" and started drinking. I was like a kid in a candy store with no parents around! In 1982, I hid my homosexuality so I could join the Army. I traveled all over the world and everywhere I could always find another man to have sex with. I went through periods of deep depression, when I felt so lonely I wanted to die. When I came out of my depression, I had to have sex to make me feel powerful and secure. I developed a hard attitude toward others, even my lovers. People existed to give me pleasure; when I was finished, I simply discarded them. At the height of my life as a gay man I felt invincible! No one could stop me, not even God. ""I don't care if I go to hell!"" I told God when I felt convicted about my sexuality. But I  was still unhappy and unfulfilled. Thoughts tormented me that I now believe came from satan: You can find sex partners anytime you want, but none of them love you. It was an attempt to push me further along the path of self destruction. After years of homosexual sex in all its devaluing forms, I still felt unloved and worthless. That was over 14 years ago. Of course, there were many issues to confront as I started down the road to total healing.  Healing was and is a process that I embrace with all my heart. God directed me to a church, where I stayed for five years, rising to become second assistant pastor. I was moving away from the residual issues of anger, hatred, and improper sexual passions. Yet I still had to deal with new challenges. Would I be accepted in the church? Would the men sense my homosexual past? Was I really free? Over the next few years, God proved his faithfulness by allowing me to build healthy relationships with godly men who loved me without prejudice. They didn't realize it, but God was using them to heal me of feelings of self-worthlessness. Eventually, I met a young woman who had begun attending the same church and we became friends. Over the next year, God confirmed in many ways that we belonged together. My passions changed and I knew God had created me to love a woman, not a man.  Before I proposed to Dee, I told her about my past. ""Honey"" she responded, ""if God has forgiven you, so do I.""  We were married and began our life together. Today, almost 12 years later that woman, DeeÑ is still my wife, and is still the most beautiful woman in the  world.

1858	gayRights	You bring up a very interesting point DaWolfman. Would gay adoption be unfair for the child? From my point-of-view, I would say no. If the parents were loving and caring, and the child was raised in a good household, then I would imagine it would be more of a benefit than a hindrance. As for the bullies on the playground picking on the kid, it is unfair but it happens. Children are picked on for a plethora of reasons: for their intelligence, hair, freckles, deformities, you name it. But I don't think that means they should compromise to fit the social norm (especially the social norm of a playground bully, whatever age that may be).

There is more in the Bible about the Jonathan and David partnership than about the creation of the universe.Scripture vividly contrasts the loving, committed partnership of Jonathan and David with the failed marriage of David and Princess Michal and with the violent, murderous relationship between King Saul, David and Jonathan. Saul tried to kill both David and Jonathan.Certainly you are correct that two men can have an intimate friendship without being sexual.

If that's the question you want to ask, why don't we also ask whether people are ""born believing in Christianity"" and whether ""belief in Christianity can be overcome or even cured""?  We could eliminate all this hand-wringing about   homosexuality   if the right wing Christians would simply abandon their wicked ways and convert to a more reasonable   religion  .  But they don't want to, do they?The simple fact is that most gay men and women are happy the way they are and don't want to change.  Whether it's a choice or whether they can change really doesn't matter.

I'm not an expert (it's obvious if you read my other comments on things) but that doesn't stop me from having my own theories. Research shows   children   who are raised by   homosexual   couples are more likely to be   gay   themselves. That seems to me not an indication of increased   tolerance   but an affirmation that the social aspect is a lot more influential in a person's sexual orientation than is given credit for. That's the only theory based on evidence now hear one on experience if you would. Part I think is due to what I would call the ""under dog"" complex, or a separate term ""emotional masochism"". Take this all with a grain of salt if you would. Here in America the under dog is idolized. The valiant struggle for rights, the strength of will to be the downtrodden of   society   and emerge a ""better"" person than before is portrayed in hundreds of movies and real life stories.

If you look at where I'm going to school you might be surprised to learn that even here being ""responsible"" is a rarity. As for the emotional masochism my last roommate was the perfect test case example. Allow me to explain, Up all night ""studying"" listening to rock music on his head phones he complains that he can't remember anything he ""learns"". No duh. With the same situation he complains it takes him an hour to do a math problem. No duh. (What does he do during the day you ask? Watches TV) He complains that he can't keep a steady girlfriend for some unknown reason. (He's cheated on the last 3 and news travels fast). Is there a cure to his ills? Yes there is. Have we told him when he's asked us what to do? Yes we have. Did he listen? No. Why not? The only conclusion I can find is that he likes to have this ""right"" to complain about how rough his life is. Although she may not like me quoting her ""Livvy"" had a point when she said, ""Yeah...and...who hasn't?"" Life is rough.

1875	gayRights	"I know this is a discussion on gay marriage but I felt like I had to jump in here. I am gay and I think I should have the same rights and resposibilities as everyone else. I am also a child protection worker and have some experience as part of the government you rail against. I think you would agree there has to be intervention from our government and society when you see a child that was not merely spanked but beaten, burned and emotionally scared from abuse. What people don't realize is that no one is going to go after them if a child is spanked once in awhile or disciplined harshly. If there was a mark left, then there is a problem. Trust me, no one is going to tell you how to parent your child unless you are hurting your child which is against the law of our land and agreed upon by our society. It is incredibly hard to balance laws and acceptable society norms when investigating child neglect. ""The government"" or child protective services is often caught in the untenable position of ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" when either a child has been found to be severely abused or child protection investigates parents that did nothing wrong. To make matters worse very little information about any case can be released to the public because people have privacy rights as they should. I suppose this will always be an arguement with folks that have had no experience or bad experiences with protective services. The fact is protective services investigates and works with hundreds of thousands of cases a year where families were helped and given resources or kids were saved from further abuse and neglect. I will tell you one thing, I love my job because I get to work with families to make thier lives better and I wouldn't trade it for the world. I am not the monster that wants to steal your children as is often portrayed in the media. I also have been a parent and stood on that line where the three year old pushes you to your limits and you stand there in a haze of anger and you want to hit him. Some people hit him, some people don't and then some people beat him to within an inch of his life or further. There are choices and then there are consequences for those choices. By the way, I am no longer a parent because my kids could only be adopted by one same-sex parent and she took them out of state when we split up. I have no legal recourse. No marriage or civil-union, no parental rights or joint adoptions."	AGAINST

They shouldn't be in politics either. Religion bases their rules on faith, not on morality. Politics should create laws based on common sense, morality, and trends, not on religious views and traditions that become ""institutionalized"" by the state over time."	FAVOR
1877	gayRights	"Where did   the law   come from?  I don't know, and I appreciate your thoughtful explanation, but you have made a large number of assumptions in your argument.  Unfortunately, my profound skepticism and love for the truth prevents me from accepting your assumptions outright without any evidence or explanation of why you think it's safe to make them.  So if you truly want to convince me, and I honestly am open-minded, you will need to give me some more information about these assumptions.  For clarity's sake, I will go through each of your paragraphs in order and ask questions where I need more clarification.  1.  First of all, I was not aware that the concept of marriage would not exist without   religion  .  Can you please give me some more information about which religion invented the concept of marriage, or perhaps point me in the direction of where you learned this?  I have not learned this in my studies, which admittedly have not been exhaustive.  As for birth rates, I am familiar about the low birth rates in some countries, but I do not see what that has to do with gay marriage.  If I had to guess, I would think that you mean to say that countries that are less religious have fewer   children  , but I do not see how that relates to the legality of gay marriage.  Remember, this debate is about whether gay marriage should be   legal  , not about religious views on gay marriage.  If you want to argue that laws should be based on religion you are welcome to do so, but I'm not a huge fan of theocracy myself.  I am a huge fan of the US Constitution, personally.  2.  I am not familiar with the shocking violation of   religious freedom   that you mention here, and would like to read more about it.  Could you provide a little more detail so I can do some research?  Names of the agencies involved, name of a court case, which state/time period... any of these things would help me to find more detail about the cases involved.  3.  ""Confusing children at an early age as to whether they should marry a boy or a girl is not good for children still in the development stages.""  In this statement you have assumed two things a) if it is legal for homosexuals to marry, children will be confused about who they want to marry, and b) such confusion is harmful to the child in a way that you did not specify.  This may be correct, but again I have not seen the evidence, could you tell me where I could read more about these claims?  ""Claiming that it doesn't matter whether a child marries a boy or a girl is equivalent to   society   saying that girls are the SAME as boys.""  Here, you have inadvertantly committed a logical fallacy.  The two claims are not equivalent.  Here, I'll show you:  ""It doesn't matter if a business owner is a woman or a man.  Therefore, women and men are the same.""  The two are not equivalent.  If you think they are, do you mean to suggest that women should not be allowed to own small businesses?  Of course not, you made no such claim because the scientific that men and women are not biologically identical is not the same thing as a society standard about what men and women should or should not be allowed to do.  4.  I'm sorry, I did not say that changes in societal attitudes are required.  I do not think that I have the right to dictate what others are allowed to believe.  I do have personal standards which differ from the most common societal views, but I do not really feel compelled to demand that others change their views to be like me.  As much as I'd love for us to agree about something :)  Your notion that something being legal means that society ""endorses"" it confuses me, if you care to clarify this position I'd love to hear it.  And the rest of this paragraph appears to be your complaints about   adoption     law  .  As I mentioned in my original post, if you think the adoption laws should be changed, then you're in the wrong place.  This debate is about whether homosexual couples should be allowed to get married, not about whether they should be allowed to adopt children.  If you feel that's a problem, why aren't you against gay adoption?  Why gay marriage?  And finally, it's great that you care about the rights of children, but all children do have a mother and father, as far as I know... maybe I missed human cloning coming into vogue?  I think you mean to say that you think all children have the right to be raised the way that you think is most appropriate.  Do you also feel that we should enact laws dictating how parents are allowed to raise children?  It's fine with me if you do, I'm just trying to understand your argument.

Sin is the human depravity that causes us to live and do things outside of health limits. I find that like myself and many others I knew, something in our lives led us to making the choice to live gay. Usually it was abuse, molestation, rejection, or parents speaking things over our lives that caused us to become confused about who we were made to be.

The author's reasoning was because their taking jobs unseated social order, caused breakdown in the class system, and caused woes to women that in turn drove them to feminism and caused men to disrespect the gentler sex.

On the other hand linking homosexuality to same sex marriage may seem like an acceptable leap but as someone else proved in a comment before it is a false analogy. Episcopalian churches are known to be advocates of gay rights - including gay marriage- although they do not think homosexuality is necessarily ""right."" It is easy to use faith as a crutch to an argument against something; it is also easy to manipulate words to form an argument as well. I would like to see an argument against same-sex marriage that does not rely on these methods and uses logic and proof as the foundation, instead."	FAVOR
1893	gayRights	"I read your post and thank you for writing. Not too many people take the time to listen and care for others, but I believe your conclusion is incomplete. Although indeed homosexuals may be from birth and it is not their fault, (that is my personal belief), it does not answer the fundamental question of is it correct behavior or ""good behavior"" for themselves or anyone else. If you determine what is good as doing as you feel compelled, well what if someone felt compelled to murder, or have sex with children since birth? What if they act on that compulsion, and truly many of these sociopaths are that way from birth. Are we to judge them? Yes, their actions are wrong. Do we condemn them? If they commit crimes, yes. But are the actions of homosexuals wrong in some sense? Absolutely. I can say that because I believe in an absolute moral law, someone who does not belive in a moral law beyond themselves cannot use the word absolute. Do we condemn them? No. Why? Have they taken the rights of another in their actions? No. So they are not doing illegal activity. So what do we as a society do? We love them, we treat them as equals, and we decide for ourselves what is morally correct. I believe it is immoral behavior, do I have that right to believe that, who is to tell me my philosophical beliefs , who is to tell them theirs? To ask a question is it a sin, unfortunately sets up both sides for a fight, it may be better to ask, should we live in the context of our own conciences having a view to the liberties of those in our society.

1894	gayRights	It is this fact that led me to the logical conclusion that being Gay is generally not a choice. The ones that make a choice are the few, especially women from my experience, that enjoy sexual experimentation. They are the exception and don't truly classify as Gay IMO.	FAVOR
1895	gayRights	"I'm not going to bash the question, because it's an interesting one. However, the question of ""is someone born gay"" deserves a ""no"" response because in my opinion, nobody can be born gay because that makes it seem like being gay is genetic which I don't think is true. It's a way of life that someone chooses by influences like people in their lives, cultural icons, personal decision, and quite possibly a psychological issue(s).The way of life has gay people ""down there"" and straight as ""up there"". In other words, it's taboo to be gay in some people's point of view. Religious   bible   thumpers say it goes against everything in the Good Book that   marriage   is a sacred unity between a man and a woman. Whatever the case may be, the person already in ""confusion"" about him/herself will only be feeling more confused. The influence of a celebrity, person in their life, or another icon will make them feel like ""Yeah... I can be just like them. Free."" This is a matter of choice.Another way someone may become gay is by personal decision. Following up on influences, someone may just decide for themselves because they may think it's best for them. The person may just have no desire for females or males, but may have desire for those of their own gender. Of course, if the person is a total worshipper of celebrities and outside influences, this is a decision made on their own.One last way a person may become gay is because he/ she might have a psychological problem. I know this paragraph will spark controversy, but I do believe this is a way that someone might become gay. The child growing up might not have had much of a male/ female influence around them growing up, and they may have ""turned"" at an early age because of it. And yes when I say ""turned"" I say that they swayed sexually. I do believe that too much male influence on a female side at a young age, can program the girls' brain into being more ""male-oriented"" in result making her a lesbian and making her attracted to other gay females. And vice versa on the male side making him ""gay"" attracted to other gay males. The thinking that someone is born gay isn't preposterous, but just not correct in my opinion. If being gay was in fact genetic, I'm pretty sure that discovery would have been discovered by now. I lean towards no because I strongly believe it is a personal decision made by the person to become gay."	AGAINST

This year public funding to deal with HIV/AIDS has risen by $500,000. Citing Òthe right to marryÓ as one of the Òimportant challengesÓ in a place where ÒitÕs a great time to be gayÓ, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health helped produce The Little Black Book, Queer in the 21st Century, a hideous work of obscene   pornography   which was given to   kids   at Brookline High School on April 30, 2005. Among other things, it gives ÒtipsÓ to boys on how to perform oral sex on other males, masturbate other males, and how to ÒsafelyÓ have someone urinate on you for sexual pleasure. It also included a directory of bars in Boston where young men meet for anonymous sex. Given the extreme dysfunctional nature of homosexual relationships, the Massachusetts Legislature has felt the need to spend more   money   every year to deal with skyrocketing homosexual domestic violence. This year $350,000 was budgeted, up $100,000 from last year.At my own   children  's high school there was a school-wide assembly to celebrate same-sex ÒmarriageÓ in early December, 2003.

Literature on   same-sex marriage   Ð how it is now a normal part of   society   Ð was handed out to the students.At a school in Mass. a class was held in March of 2000 that is down right criminal.

In September, 2004, an 8th-grade teacher in Brookline, MA, told National Public Radio that the marriage ruling had opened up the floodgates for teaching homosexuality. ÒIn my mind, I know that, `OK, this is legal now.' If somebody wants to challenge me, I'll say, `Give me a break. It's legal now,'Ó she told NPR. She added that she now discusses gay sex with her students as explicitly as she desires. For example, she said she tells the kids that lesbians can have vaginal intercourse using sex toys.In 2005, when David Parker of Lexington, MA Ð a parent of a kindergartner Ð strongly insisted on being notified when teachers were discussing homosexuality or transgenderism with his son, the school had him arrested and put in jail overnight.Second graders at the same school were read a book, ÒKing and KingÓ, about two men who have a romance and marry each other, with a picture of them kissing. When parents Rob and Robin Wirthlin complained, they were told that the school had no obligation to notify them or allow them to opt-out their child. In 2006 the Parkers and Wirthlins filed a federal Civil Rights lawsuit to force the schools to notify parents and allow them to opt-out their elementary-school children when homosexual-related subjects were taught. The federal judges dismissed the case. The judges ruled that because same-sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts, the school actually had a duty to normalize homosexual relationships to children, and that schools have no obligation to notify parents or let them opt-out their children! Acceptance of homosexuality had become a matter of good   citizenship  !In 2006, in the elementary school where my daughter went to Kindergarten, the parents of a third-grader were forced to take their child out of school because a man undergoing a sex-change operation and cross-dressing was being brought into class to teach the children that there are now Òdifferent kinds of families.Ó School officials told the mother that her complaints to the principal were considered Òinappropriate behavior.Ó	AGAINST
1906	gayRights	"The design argument is a valid, compeling argument. It is also very simple: Life clearly speaks of design. From a scientific view, it is extreemly improbable that life is here by any other means except a designer. For that fact, is it so improbable that life is here by any other means than a designer, that from an engieering perspective, it is a certainty that a designer behind life exists.Given this, it is extreemly clear that male and female sexual organs are ""desgined"" for each other. Therefore, we as humans, are designed to engage is sexual realtions with the opposite sex. We are NOT desgined to engage in sexual realtions with the same sex.Now to the argument that other species engage is same-sexual relations: The last time I looked, I'm a human. I'm not a giraffe, I'm not an insect, etc... I'm a human. It is also clear that we live in a world that has significant problems. These problems are clearly seem in bad and destructive behariour of man, deseases, etc... The who reason phycologists and counselaors can make a living is that we, as humans have problems. Not only do humans have behavior problems, but there is behavior problems in the animal kingdom as well. In order to show that homosexual behavior in the animal kingdom validates human homosexual behavior, you will need to show that the designer has intended this as normal behavior in the animal kingdom as a whole. Excluding the species that can actually propogate themselves with this kind of behaviour, there is no basis to belive that the designer behind life intends for this to be normative. the further a species is from humans, the less the analogy applies logically."

1907	gayRights	"You should, perhaps, question your assumptions that a child ""needs"" two parents. For the reasons I stated before - the variable personality of the child and variable personality of the parent(s), one can make general statements of what is common to all children and common to all parents, but one really can't say definitively that the specific needs of one child are the same specific needs of another. You will no doubt find individuals in all cutlures who got along just fine with only one parent - of either gender - and likely will find individuals who had more than two who profited from that arrangement. You will also find plenty of individuals who had what is considered by some to be the ""optimum parental arrangement"" - two parents of opposite genders who are permanently scarred by that experience.All of this to say - the assumption that a child needs two parents of opposite gender to grow up happy and well-adjusted is likely as false as the assumption the child needs two.

1908	gayRights	"""Only people who believe in the Christian ""God"" are moral, is what you're saying.""Actually, I am not saying this.  Nothing I said should have given this conclusion however I apologize if it did.  Realativly speaking, all people are capable of morality.  However, we are only capable in as much as we respond to the Good given to us, not out of our own selves since man is by nature sinful (Romans 5).  Though I understand you may not agree with the Scriptures totally pherhaps we can share the common ground that no person is perfect, people are selfish and are not 100% good.  This is comparable to what the Scriptures talk about that people have a sin nature that we have inherited through Adam by which we have an innate tendency to bend toward sin, e.g. selfishness, unloving heart and behavior etc.  Since the Scriptures teach that God is reaching out to all people everywhere I actually believe that people may be able to act morally good in the true sense if they are responding out of grace given them and by the activity of the Holy Spirit in their soul whether they are Christian or not.  There is even the posiblity of man acting morally good out of an original goodness of man that has not been totaly corrupted by the marr of sin.  Even beside this sinful people may act morally good at a civil level, though not neccsarily in accordance with absolute good.  That is why I say realativly speaking there is moral good that people who are not believrs can do.  Even the good that Christians do, that nonbelievers supposdly cannot due, is the result of the goodness of God at work in them and not any more claimable by that person then any other.  If it wasn't for God they wouldn't be any different.  I hope that wasn't too confusing.  In your second argument you assume many things.  You assume that homosexuals are a class of people that have biological cause to their homosexuality.  In other words, they are ""born with it.""  Not only is this unverifiable it is not were good science is pointing.  Obviously it is not a choice.  As I have wresteled with my own homosexuality I will be the first to say ""I did not choose this."" But there is not way I was born this way.  You say: ""Who the crap are you to know better than ""God"" how a person is supposed to be made?""Can't we I ask you the same question?  How do you know someone living a homosexual lifestyle is living according to God's design?  We know that it is not so because God has told us so through his Word. (1 Timothy 3:16, Leviticus 18:22)  You say: ""If that person was made by ""God"" then it was ""God"" who created that sinful cocktail mix of chemicals that dictates to that person whom he or she will be sexually attracted to. That would make the act of ""God"" a sinful act... which, if you believe in ""God""... you know can't happen.""First off, God created sex and that ""mix of chemicals"" that all are a part of our sexuality are not sinful.  God created sex and he created it good.  The falleness of human nature lends what was originally good to all sorts of deviations.  The Catholic church (although I am not Roman Catholic) does not teach that a homosexual orientation is sinful but acting on it is, you are correct.  But, they do teach that it is an ""intrinsic disorder"" even an evil. Not that the person is responsible to that sin or evil but that the homosexual orientation is a manifestation of human falleness just like all sin is including deviations such as alcholisim and sexual addicition.  The homosexul is a victim to sin like all of us are.  Thanks be to God that he has provided a way out of this and brought life to us anew (Romans 5).  The Scriptures teach:""As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath. But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressionsÑit is by grace you have been saved.""  (Ephesians 2:1-5, NIV) We were by natures objects of wrath but God still loved and loves us.  This is preciesly why he gave his son to us that if we believe in him we shall not perish but have everlasting, full life now and later.  The fact that all people are imperfect and have inclinations to sin is not a product of God's creative work but of Satan's twisting of the good creation through sin.  God did not sin in making any of us but all of us have falleness.  Homosexuality is just one of many manifestations of this falleness and like all mankind homosexuals are in need of a savior.

1909	gayRights	 I read this article at the citizen link web site calling for the APA to acknowledge and respect personal autonomy and religious diversity. Stating that the APA has not acknowledged that personal decision or self determination of ones sexual orientation is possible and has even said it is dangerous. This article dispells those fears and shows through actual scientifc study and research that one can change their sexual attractions and decide for themselves whom they will be attracted to and respond. Apparently in 1973 the APA adopted a principle to always have public declartions backed up by research and not follow public opinion but some how according to Dr. Jones has forgone that directive to bow to cultural pressures in regards to many things including sexual orientation. This lack of professionalism has caused quite a rift in the scientific world regarding the APA making any public pronouncements.

1910	gayRights	"Nice try at a cut and past job, but your argument does not hold water as the analogy between interracial marriage and homosexual unions does not carry over.As I stated in my previous argument the practice of legal recognition of aspects of homosexual unions is new and unprecedented. Indeed it is unprecedented everywhere in the history of the world. This is quite unlike interracial marriage which has been practiced in many times in many places throughout history, and in most cases without any special legal opinion on the matter. Homosexual unions are different and are new in their established recognition under law.But that aside, i would point out that my original argument was addressing the issue of the curruption of language, and of the importance of preserving the long standing meaning of words, especially when there are no easy alternatives; such as in the case of the word ""marriage"". By attempting to broaden or slightly redefine the meaning of a word, you neccessarily dilute its original meaning.If proponents of non-sex-specific unions had rallied for civil unions, or same sex unions recognition under the law, we would not be having this conversation. What proponents of the phrase ""gay marriage"" demand is that the rest of society be forced to accept their own standard of the meaning of those words. And they seek to force this by attempting to enshrine their own particular minority definition upon the majority. This is form of calculated aggression against long standing traditional meaning of language, and should not be tolerated by a civil society.In this Republican form of government, the minority should be protected from the majority, but the majority should also be protected from the minority. Even at their peak, the Nazis never had a majority of political affiliation, they took power as a political minority, but look what havok they wreaked upon their own citizenry and the values which they imposed by force upon the majority!When language is eroded by degrees, then it ceases to have meaning; communication, and even thought itself become impossible. And society is brought unto a state of total decay and ruin. What once were men are then little more than animals. Read a page out of Orwell's 1984. The government's new speak is double ungood."

I grew up with a single mother, and while she certainly did her best, she couldn't answer all my questions as a boy. That's why I had a grandfather, uncles, family friends, teachers, coaches and others who I could rely on. Every situation is unique (in my case I was likely better off without my father in my home), but I absolutely feel that their collective help but me at no disadvantage.

Few creatures on this earth do not look out for the wellfare their offsprings.  However, the primary premise of raising children is not to make us feel good, but to promote procreation and continuation of the species.  As childern grow up they see their parents as role models whether good or bad.  Homosexual households are simply sending the wrong message to the maturing child.	AGAINST
1914	gayRights	"It is not clear your claim that the context in which Romans was written has to do exclusively with the Cybele cult. Paul wrote that letter to explain his view of the gospel to the romans, and not as a corrective to specific problems as he did on the epistles to the corinthians. He begins explaining how idolatry and pride, led humanity to other sins when their hearts separated from God, including homosexuality.And I think you're being imprecise too in the other passages you quote in the arguments:1. With respect to Adam and Eve, he created them as sexual beings who could fulfill his purpose of 'filling the earth and increase in number' (and the problem of over population doesn't invalidate the command, it was caused by not managing sexuality as God established it) And though later came poligamy, it occurred after fall, and then on the new testament is explicit that godly people should be married to one woman.2. When you quote Lev 18:22 as referred to the cult of Molech, is not precise. When you read the whole chapter, Moses writes a series of sins that include unlawful sexual relationships, amongst homosexuality is found. The fact that the previous verse condemned the parents who offered their sons to Molech, doesn't mean the next verse is related. In fact on every mention of Molech in the bible is related to the child sacrifices (which, by the way, also violate the command to fill the earth and increase in number).Is so clear that two chapters ahead he repeats the command in Leviticus 20:13 ""'If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable."" and in this occasion there is no sign it is directly related to the cult of Molech.I think the people at Exodus, as well as you, share the same general goal: to bring those with wanted or unwanted same sex attraction close to God. But in that path the means are as important as the ends. And sadly, one of both positions is wrong, and therefore is sinning (if it were Exodus, in not accepting that is God's will that people have same sex attraction; if it is you and the churches that accept homsexuality as normal, the sin will be of encouraging people to accept a sin as a way of life).I stay with the side that it is a sin."

1919	gayRights	I have found that there are a few argument tactics that are used to get people to agree with the point being defended. One of those tactics is to associate the opposing point to something that is almost universally despised. This tactics works because a lot of people are passionate beings that are too lazy to analyze the argument and realize that there was an association made (not an comparison).For example, associating civil unions with slavery and no suffrage for women is not a comparison.Civil unions are the same thing as marriage, only with a different name (this is a comparison). Slavery was not the same thing as freedom, only with a different name. Women not allowed to vote was not the same as women suffrage, only with a different name. Therefore one cannot make the comparison between civil unions and slavery (or civil unions and suffrage) and show that they are similar. In both slavery and not allowing women to vote, people were losing rights. In civil unions, they are given marriage rights (but a different word is used).	AGAINST

This partitioning did not exist at all in scripture""<<<< I submit that scripture does differentiate (partition) same sex sexual activity and that this differentiation/partition was recognized by the authors of scripture who wrote about Sodom, by the authors of scripture who alluded to Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 and by Jewish rabbis and philosophers like Philo of Alexandria. All of them focused on shrine prostitution when discoursing on these verses, as did the rabbis whose human wisdom fills the Babylonian Talmud.    Further, Dr. Gagnon (THE most ardent anti-gay evangelical alive today) contradicts your assertion on pages 100-110 and 130 of his book when he asserts the primacy of shrine prostitution in ancient Israel and remarks that shrine prostitution was the primary manifestation of homosexual activity in ancient Israel.Gagnon, the anti-gay crusader, differentiates committed faithful, non-cultic same sex partnerships from the shrine prostitution against which Moses and God inveigh in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13.Second, EVERY human author of scripture who mentions Sodom fails to link Sodom to homosexuality.    Third, EVERY human author of scripture who alludes to Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13 links the verses to shrine prostitution or the qadesha (shrine prostitutes).

In addition, we found no differences as a function of family type in measures of personal adjustment, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety; in measures of school adjustment, such as academic achievement, trouble in school, or feelings of school connectedness; or in measures of the qualities of family relationships, such as autonomy, care from adults and peers, neighborhood integration, or parental warmth. The clarity of results from this broad array of assessments strengthens our confidence that adolescents living with same-sex parents were functioning well in many domains, both at home and at school.Ó p. 1895ÒMost adolescents in our sample reported having had a romantic relationship in recent months, but only a minority reported having had sexual intercourse; there were no significant differences in this regard as a function of family type.Ó p. 1895ÒAn unexpected aspect of our results was the finding that adolescents' feelings of connectedness at school varied as a function of family type. Adolescents living with same-sex parents reported feeling more connected to school than did those living with opposite-sex parents. Inasmuch as school connectedness among adolescents has been associated with fewer problem behaviors and greater emotional well-being (Resnick et al., 1997), this finding suggests that adolescents with same-sex parents might be expected to show more favorable adjustment. For measures of adjustment such as self-esteem and depressive symptoms, however, we found no effects of family type. Consequently, the best interpretation of this intriguing finding remains unclear.Ó p. 1896However, we cannot conclusively say here that (1) same-sex parents are just as good for their children (due to small population size and the fact that ""good parents"" might be a result of other things like community, etc.) or (2) same-sex parents are just as mentally stable as opposite-sex parents.

Yes, it is true that same-sex parents all have step-families by default, but many (most?) times these are step-families since the time of the child's birth.

If people wish to get married or divorced, why does Uncle Sam or any of the 50 states really care?So to summarize, Gay marriage does hurt us. It hurts us by allowing the government to further violate the constitution by respecting the beliefs of established religion.

1951	gayRights	Rick,Thank you for your comments, which are quite well thought out. I have to say that even though they are well thought out, I disagree with them. I've found that your arguments ignore a common theme in scripture. I've also noted that you've not mentioned key passages about sexual relationships and marriage in their appropriate context. But before doing so, let me be specific about my views.Before I say anything else, I'd like to say that I am a former homosexual. I believe that the Bible dictates sin as sin, but does not condemn the person. What do I mean? John 3:16 writes that God loved the world (humans) and sent his son to die. God doesn't say that sin is acceptable, but provides the solution for it. God loves every person, and wants the best for them. In the same way whether a person is gay or not should not have a bearing on how God loves them, this according to scripture. However, at the same time, Scripture is crystal clear that homosexuality is a sin, and all sin needs to be dealt with, just as I have dealt with mine(1 John 1:8-10).In your Seven Flawed Arguments you have not mentioned Jesus sayings in their correct form: (Mark 10:6-9 NIV)	AGAINST

Marriage is a cultural construct that transcends religions, whose requirements and structure vary from religion to religion, culture to culture, period to period.Marriage as understood in western society arose from property issues, particularly inheritance for legitimate male offspring.  For a signficant part of Christian history, the Christian church did not participate in marriages.  Marriage in the U.S. is not contingent on having any religious allegiance, nor does it require adherence to the rules and beliefs of one's chosen religion.  The marriage contract in the U.S. is a civil contract, and the clergy's religious role in weddings is ancillary to the civil authority they are granted by the state to recognize the civil contract of marriage."

1958	gayRights	"If rational truth is not subjective and it can be validated by this faith, a faith which requires God, then it is dependent on a spiritual truth.  If this spiritual truth is merely subjective than anything built on its foundation must also be subjective.  In this case there is again, no objective rational truth.  However, if it is objective than rational truth can also be objective.  Therefore, if rational truth is objective so must be spiritual truth.  This is not to disregard the reality that each human does have different experiences and phenomenon and that our minds make sense often with our language and other systems of the world around us.  However, there is an objective reality we can know because of God.  God is just an abstract exterior concept that as a principle guarantees our true witness of reality but he himself is involved in this world.  He was involved as its Creator, sustains all things and came into it most definitively in the person of Jesus Christ.  Spiritual truth has a basis in reality.  It is not just human belief but human belief in a real God, in the real person of Jesus Christ.  ""Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.""- (Hebrews 11:1, KJV)Faith is evidence.  It is evidence not of that which is not real but that which, though unseen, is real.  Notice that I have stated that rational truth, if it is able to be objective, can be objective.  It is not always.  By the nature of reason it should be sound but by the nature of the humans who reason we know it is often not.  We are limited.  Rational truth cannot be limited to only materialism or scientisim.  That is rational truth is based in the real but that does not mean it is only based in matter or in the stuff we can see, taste, hear, touch etc.  Nor is it limited to only being correct if it is scientific and is discerned through the scientific method.  Spiritual truth can be perfectly rational but cannot be demanded to bow to the narrow views of materialism or scientisim or naturalism or other human philosophies.  This does not mean that spiritual truth is automatically right because it is spiritual but it does mean that spiritual truth can be rational.  You are correct in asserting that anything humans do is flawed.  Including our rational minds.  Why is it logical that our flawed system of rational should pluck out our flaws when it in itself is flawed. The Word of God however, is from God and through written through men is from him and perfect. Furthermore, faith is also a gift from God.   Truth comes from God, without him there is not truth. Truth begins with him not with man.  Man is not the measure, God is.  That God has spoken to us is how truth comes to us, in the Bible.  This truth came through the real, in real societies, in real men and woman in time and history.  Likewise did Christ, the Word made flesh.  This is the difference between Christianity and all other religions.  As Bishop Fulten Sheen said, ""If religion is mans search for God Christianity is God's search for man.""  We can't assume that all religions have the same origin as if they are all essentially the same when in reality they are not.  The Bible did not come from man but from God.  The pain, unrest and warfare that has spurred from religious conflict is truly tragic.  We should be able to be rational but that does not mean that faith is irrational.  The Ten Commandments are not the opposite of the U.S. Constitution, it historically undeniable fact of their and other Biblical influence on the U.S. Constitution.  The summary of the commandments is not do not but do, do love God and do love your neighbor.  They are laws that deal with God and people.  To kill or murder is wrong in Christian faith because it is a sin against God and against that persons humanity.  God does stuff with purpose, including give his laws.  God hates murder because he loves all people.  He wants us to trust him and obey him out of faith and trust but that doesn't mean that because we should obey him because we love and trust him that his laws have not reason, quite the opposite.  God is definer of justice itself and he is the source of every reason for justice as he is the source of reason.  Biblical faith is not irrational or foolhardy.

Dont even try to say it isnt there is way to much proof otherwise!AP) WASHINGTON - A Duke University official has been arrested and charged with offering his adopted 5-year-old son for sex.Frank Lombard, the school's associate director of the Center for Health Policy, was arrested after an Internet sting, according to the FBI's Washington field office and the city's   police   department.According to an affidavit by District of Columbia Police Det. Timothy Palchak, an unnamed informant facing charges in his own child sex case led authorities to Lombard.Authorities said that Lombard tried to persuade a person -who he did not know was a police officer -to travel to North Carolina to have sex with Lombard's child.The detective's affidavit charges Lombard identified himself online as ""perv dad for fun,"" and says that in an online chat with the detective, Lombard said he had sexually molested his son, whom he adopted as an infant.The court papers say Lombard also invited the undercover detective to North Carolina to have sex with the young boy, and even suggested which hotel he should use.""In response to the AP report, which most of the newspapers used almost verbatim, Mike Adams of Townhall made the observation that ""The Associate Press (AP) did not mention the fact that the five-year old offered up for molestation was black. Bringing that fact to light might be damaging to the political coalition that exists between blacks and gays. Nor did the AP mention that the adopted child is being raised by a homosexual couple.

Whether if be a man and a man or a women and a women as a couple having the opportunity to raise a child. Also, the topic makes mention of human interaction with the child, during the raising and nurturing, from a male and a female. Can the same be done with two of the same sex? I would argue that you cannot compare apples to oranges. That is why I was interested in the specific points of nurture and the ability to raise. Which you so eloquently wrote out and felt the need to go into an extreme situation. While I do understand what you are stating, that is why we have a legal system in place. This is to prevent what US society would not consider a suitable parent. What you fail to address is how a Gay couple would not make a suitable parental unit.

(Oh yeah, and you have comments waiting in the other place you made this post.)""Perhaps the people polled were -not- chosen at random. Perhaps the people polled were pulled from parts of the country where promiscuity, drug use, alcohol, etc. were already rampant. Did the study report their findings on opposite-sex couples within their sample?Furthermore, promiscuity, drug use, alcohol, etc. could very well have been the result of homosexuality being perceived as a social stigma, in which case -homosexuality- is not causing the promiscuity, etc. but -social stigmas-.Or perhaps those are linked to lacking marriage. Are there studies that report these same variables with married and unmarried opposite-sex couples? I don't find this one to be a far cry from the truth either, because homosexuals would be promiscuous as a result of not needing to stay in a marriage.I -will- be satisfied with data once the data is sufficient and can counterbalance some of the data I've found. Until then, I don't think you can draw your conclusions without sticking the word ""premature"" in front of them.""Furthermore, it was demonstrated that some of the studies cited actually came from people polled within AIDS clinics and the like.Personally, I think hate crimes are a decent measure of how society responds to homosexuality:      (Table 1 for each year under Hate Crimes section) As you'll notice, hate crimes have neither had a dramatic increase or drop since 1995, suggesting that tolerance may only be getting -slightly- better (if we account for the population increase, though we have to counterbalance for cities lost within the samples). Furthermore, you and I both know that there's going to be a time-lag in the feedback system here. Information isn't spread instantaneously; people don't change their perception of themselves overnight.As for the data I've collected, it revolves around -parenting-, and to infer that -parenting- is closely enough related to -mental stability-... I don't think there's a close enough connection. In any case, I pulled the information from here: Psychosocial Adjustment, School Outcomes, and Romantic Relationships of Adolescents With Same-Sex Parents. Jennifer L. Wainright, Stephen T. Russell, and Charlotte J. Patterson. Child Development, 2004, Volume 75, Number 6, Pages 1886-1898.In the introduction, the author cites various other studies which I'm not particularly interested in, though the studies contend that same-sex parents have no effect on children's self esteem.I believe that the study only used forty-four families, though, so you'll have to realize that the sample might be too small and not representative of the community.ÒThe results of the present study, which is the first based on a large national sample of adolescents living with same-sex couples, revealed that on nearly all of a large array of variables related to school and personal adjustment, adolescents with same-sex parents did not differ significantly from a matched group of adolescents living with opposite-sex parents. Regardless of family type, adolescents were more likely to show favorable adjustment when they perceived more caring from adults and when parents described close relationships with them. Thus, as has been reported in studies of children with lesbian mothers (e.g., Chan et al., 1998), it was the qualities of adolescent-parent relationships rather than the structural features of families (e.g., same vs. opposite-sex parents) that were significantly associated with adolescent adjustment (Golombok, 1999; Patterson, 2000).Ó p. 1895"	FAVOR

""Don't ask don't tell"" is fair in the sense that commanders and officers alike are barred from asking about the sexuality of soldiers. This levels the playing field to a certain extent.

This was the compromise that was struck when Bill Clinton sought to enable gays in the military, but was met with heavy resistance. Restrictions on officers and commanders inquiring about the orientation of members of the military was an improvement over the previous policy, which forbid gays and allowed overt inquires and persecutions.

Here Jesus establishes the obligation for a man to marry and be faithful to one wife. 9: And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.      This reaffirms the requirement of monogamy. 10: His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.     The disciples find this rule difficult to accept. 11: But he said unto them, All (men) cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.     Jesus gives them an option. In this option he says that there are those that cannot accept this rule (to marry a woman and be monogamous). It is important to note here that he does not say Òwill notÓ, Òwould rather notÓ, Òchose not toÓ, but he said ÒcannotÓ. This would imply that he was referring to people incapable (mentally, physically, or both) from living by the rules of men. 12A (first category): For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb:     I suspect this means all those incapable of consummating a relationship with a woman for whatever reason. (hermaphrodite or gay). 12B (second category):  and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men:     We pretty well all agree that these are actual eunuchs.   12C (third category):  and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.      The church insists that these are simply celibate priests.    Logically neither of the first two groups would have any interest in women, so they would by their very nature be celibate.    The problem is that there is nothing said or done up to the moment that Christ said this that would indicate that celibacy was a requirement or even a virtue in priests. In fact, all indications are that it was disallowed. How do you Òmake yourself a EunuchÓ?  To be a eunuch 2000 years ago meant more than simple celibacy.    What Jesus said in Mathew 19 is completely self contained and can only be read literally. Well once again lets look at verse: 5: And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?     No doubt about it, if you were capable of consummating a relationship with a woman, you were required to be married. More importantly, if you were a man you were required to be married. To declare yourself a eunuch was to declare yourself uninterested in women, a eunuch, a non man. This was understood readily 2000 years ago, but modern society has a hard time grasping it.    Having said this there were eunuchs that were allowed into the temple (natural eunuchs who were anatomically correct).     If Jesus was not married he was a eunuch by his own definition. He was anatomically correct because he regularly entered the temple. He had to be a natural eunuch (or married, one or the other).    Only by declaring themselves eunuchs were they exempt from the requirement of marriage. In fact, they were exempt from all rules pertaining only to ÒmenÓ. The reason was that they were not considered to be ÒmenÓ. Rules quoted about man being with man did not apply to eunuchs because eunuchs were not considered to be men. The sin was not being gay, but pretending to be men while engaging in gay behavior.     It is most likely that the natural eunuch was the first category: 12A: For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb:and likely included homosexuals.   This group: 12C:  and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.      If Jesus was not married, then he was a eunuch. If his genitalia was mutilated he could not enter the temple. If the churchÕs definition of Òborn that way"" was hermaphrodites, then Jesus could not be either Òborn that wayÓ or Òmade that wayÓ.

Sure, some people may be unfamiliar with the facts and consider homosexuality to be not natural, but surely we have outgrown such primitive logic and come to realize that homosexuality is not only commonly found in nature but also seems to have a (significant) genetic component.As to the divine part, it seems that God managed to create something in which homosexuality was all but unnatural, although perhaps poorly understood by some.

Russell, and Charlotte J. Patterson.  Child Development, 2004, Volume 75, Number 6, Pages 1886-1898.ÒThe small body of research that has focused on adolescent offspring of families headed by same-sex couples includes Huggins's (1989) study of 36 adolescents, ages 13 to 19, 18 with divorced heterosexual and 18 with divorced lesbian mothers.  In this study, Huggins reported no differences in adolescent self-esteem as a function of mothers' sexual orientation.  Daughters of lesbian mothers also had higher self-esteem if their mother had a romantic partner who lived in the home, if their fathers did not display negative attitudes about the mother's sexual orientation, and if they learned of their mother's sexual orientation at an early age.  Huggins also reported that one adolescent with a heterosexual mother, but none with the lesbian mothers, identified as nonheterosexual.Ó p. 1887ÒO'Connor (1993) studied 11 young men and women, ages 16 to 23, who were the children of divorced or separated lesbian mothers.  Qualitative findings suggested that participants expressed strong love, loyalty, and protectiveness toward their mothers, and a desire for others to understand the benefits of having a lesbian mother, such as increased sensitivity to prejudice.  Informants, however, described worries about losing friends or being judged by others and their need to keep their mothers' sexual orientation a secret from at least some people external to the family.Ó p. 1887ÒGershon, Tschann, and Jemerin (1999) studied self-esteem, perception of stigma, and coping skills among adolescent offspring of lesbian mothers.  They conducted interviews with 76 adolescents, ages 11 to 18, and examined the impact of societal factors on self-esteem.  The participants had either been born to women who identified as lesbians (25 adolescents) or had been born in the context of their mother's earlier heterosexual marriage (51 adolescents).  Gershon et al. found that adolescents who perceived more stigma related to having a lesbian mother had lower self-esteem in five of seven areas, including social acceptance, self-worth, behavioral conduct, physical appearance, and close friendship.  They hypothesized that the presence of various types of coping skills would moderate this relationship between perceived stigma and self-esteem.  However, their results showed that only good decision making had a moderating effect: In the face of high perceived stigma, adolescents possessing better decision-making skills had higher self-concept in the area of behavioral conduct.ÓÒA slightly older population was studied in Tasker and Golombok's (1997) longitudinal study of young adult offspring of lesbian mothers.  Forty-six young adults, ages 17 to 35, were interviewed in this follow-up to Golombok et al.'s (1983) study of children raised in divorced lesbian mother or divorced heterosexual mother families.  In this generally well-adjusted sample, young men and women who were raised by lesbian mothers were no more likely than those raised by heterosexual mothers to experience depression or anxiety.  Adult children from lesbian mother families were also no more likely than those from other families to have sought professional help for psychiatric problems.  They reported having close friendships during adolescence and were no more likely to remember peer group hostility than were those from other families.  Offspring of lesbian mothers were also no more likely to report same-sex sexual attraction or a gay, lesbian, or bisexual identity than were those from heterosexual families.  They were, however, more likely to have considered a gay or lesbian relationship as a possibility for themselves and to have been involved in a same-sex relationship, suggesting that although sexual attraction and identity may not be related to parental sexual orientation, the likelihood of considering or entering a same-sex relationship may be associated with parents' sexual orientation.Ó p. 1887"	FAVOR
1984	gayRights	" The LAMBDA argument sounds rehearsed or practiced. I do not support ssm, its wrong on so many levels. But I guess one of many of my concerns with this absurd phenomenon is the fact that we know that NAMBLA has very strong and documented ties to mainstream homosexual organizations and ssm is only a front to their attempts to rape little boys. I know you will deny it but the evidence is clear and it does not support you it supports the fact that   children   will be put into harms way if ssm is allowed to be normalized by using traditional legacys ie Holy Matrimony for one man and one woman. FBI agent infiltrates NAMBLA and writes book, "" THE LAST UNDERCOVER "" where he exposes link between homosexual activists and NAMBLA.  I guess the next concern I have which also is documented that ssm if its allowed to take on the name of Holy Matrimony vs Civil Unions would only be an attempt to force   Christians   into accepting the act of   homosexuality   as pleasing to Gd and we do not beleive that it is and we beleive that ssm is only about destroying Christian foundations. We only have to look as far as the latest caper pulled by homosexual activists ie the big kiss-in orgy in front of churches to know that they are about destruction not about building anything.

As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each otherÕs bodies. 25 They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the Creator himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen. 26 That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires.

Even though He loved them, His prescence wasn't dwelling with them so there was no sense of truth or conviction. Second it says that they were abandoned to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired and that because of that they did vile things regarding their bodies.  Then it goes on to say that they exchanged the truth for a lie and so they started to worship idols rather than God. Now this is where he addresses homosexuality. Notice how it says that homosexuality is not normal in verse 26 ""Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.""

Let's look at the definition of sanctity: the quality or state of being holy or sacred. That tells me: you cannot preserve the holiness of an act that is governed by the law. That is a violation of church and state. If someone, a Christian or other religious person, wants to get married under the eyes of God in their church, then fine. But it is not our place to impede upon the rights of others that want to be married under the eyes of the law. Or even God, for that matter. I know many gay Christians. It is not our place to judge others or take away from them. Prop 8 is threatening to take away the rights of 18,000 ALREADY MARRIED couples.

1998	gayRights	"The question attempts to disguise in a kinder and gentler way a very ugly assertion - homosexual individuals are unfit to parent. That assertion has little or nothing to do with children and everything to do with unsubstantiated prejudice and brutal politics. Those who ask it believe homosexuals to be somehow sub-human or dysfunctional in their abilities and lesser in value to the heterosexual and then set out to find trivialities to support their prejudices. The problem with this thinking is its generalities which cannot fit every single specific case - homosexual OR heterosexual. It is an elementary thing to show that any single heterosexual can be every bit as dysfunctional in parenting as any single homosexual. I believe it also elementary to show that any single heterosexual couple or group to be every bit as dysfunctional in parenting as any single homosexual couple or group. Of course, the opposite of this is also likely true: there are very capable heterosexual  AND homosexual couples or groups when it comes to parenting.What matters most in a parent-child relationship isn't who the parent has sexual relations with but whether or not there is mutual love and support and healthy relations between parent and child. Is the parent an adequate guardian? Are the child's emotional needs fulfilled? If one's concern is with the child, then ask questions regarding the child's state of happiness, not whether or not the parent is sleeping with who you believe they ought to be sleeping with. One's true focus is revealed in the question itself.Those who attempt to make a very ugly value statement about homosexuals without, in their minds, being obvious about it wish there to be some truth to their generalities and ""on averages"". A human being is not a generality. A human being is an average. A human being is not a label, or class, or category. A human being is a specific with truths applicable to them and them alone. What is true of one is not necessarily true of another unless that truth has been substantiated in close examination. The mean-spirited will find something true of one or a few individuals and then wash thousands with that isolated truth to advance their agenda of meanness. Those genuinely interested in the truth will seek fact and apply whatever truth can be extracted from those facts to those examined and they alone. To apply those truths in general ways to those you perceive to be members of a class can only be a tentative exercise. Substantiation is required before one can justify acting on what one believes to be true.Why not ask such generalities as - are children with heterosexual parents at a disadvantage? The question as stated is unanswerable. Some children are and will be, some will not. It depends as much on the qualities of the child as it does on the qualities of the parent or parents. Are heterosexual parents at a disadvantage with same-sex children? Some believe they are, others do not. Again, it depends on the qualities of parent(s) and child. Are homosexual parents at a disadvantage with same-sex children? Same conclusion. Aggressive generalities will treat some individuals too kindly and some too savagely.Keep your prejudices all you like. Dressing your ugly prejudices to make them appear as unbiased scientific inquiry works with some, not with others. You believe homosexuals to be sub-human? I'm convinced you'll never prove it and will do yourself and others more harm than good in the process.Do you authentically want the truth or do you wish to comfort your own mean spirit?What one should ask is: Is this child happy and cared for adequately? The answers necessarily depend on specifics belonging to no one else but the child in question. As we all know, happiness is only an individual assessment. It cannot be made for you or by you for another."	FAVOR

Whether or not they have children is strictly up to each individual marriage.

I'm fairly neutral on that score because, in today's society, being gay is, while less difficult than it was 30 years ago when I came out, still very painful and difficult for most of us.  But I believe that being gay is morally neutral, and do not wish to see a slice of genetic diversity eliminated from the ""whole pie.""  If the presumptive sequence of ""gay genes"" does provide some other adaptive qualities to humanity, then eliminating them could have untold disastrous consequences.Consider ""stereotypically gay"" behaviors -- an interest in (and often, impressive talent for) the arts, painting, design, music, philosophy, literature.  If it is true that these genes are linked to those characteristics, as might seem plausible, how many great works of music would never be composed, great works of art never painted, great treatises never written if the genetic make-up which could play a part in enabling these abilities were destroyed in the name of ""curing gay""? Perhaps the creativity in each of us is linked to our personal complement of one or more of these theoretical ""gay genes.""

2019	gayRights	I appreciate your points, Aegiltheugly, and I could accept the union, civil union, or household designation -- except for one thing.  To yield the point would be to allow the religious right to claim a word out of the English language as belonging solely to them.  According the Websters Dictionary, 1996, marriage is defined as the taking of another person as husband or wife.  It says nothing about a husband taking a wife.  Two women can just as easily take each other as wife, or two men take each other as husband.  I feel it would be wrong to make that sort of concession to any group.

2028	gayRights	"Thanks E223, I'm getting so bored of replying to these. Tallblondguy - whether people ""turn gay"" or are born gay, is not a matter of opinion. 1+1=2 is not a matter of opinion. It's a fact. People are born gay, straight, or bi. Any change is due to chemical composition of the brain. People take forever coming out of the closet (often) because gays are discriminated against. The next paragraph where you say my response is an example of how society tells people to be gay... I think you miss read. It was an ironic diatribe of Jake's senseless response to gay marriage. You see, ironic because he though not intentional, was giving a bigoted response, so I pointed out how his response made it appear he was one of the people himself that he was being a bigot against... I know confusing. What's even more confusing is that infact the response would not have even worked had it been, as you said, me encouraging him to be gay... I don't, from your arguements, expect you to understand that.Okay, your entire right to vote arguement boggles the mind. According to your own arguement, (this is called a parody, it helps people like you who can't understand stuff, understand stuff. I'm waiting though for your literal response, since I'm sure you won't get the nuance) if 51% of Americans say we should reinstate slavery, then we didn't, then that means some great travesty had taken place, enough said.Uh... okay, now to where you twisted around my arguement to mean something completely and obviously different than what I said. you said that gay people were not discriminated against. I gave an example of how they were. Then you went all ""black people this"" and ""fear"" that, and went on a rant about losing your job.You seem to think I live in some state of fear? You're aware that I'm not gay right? If not, now you are, not that it matters in the least in any of my arguements. So I'm not sure why you think I may be afraid of something, but from my profile you can actually follow a link to my site, which has my name, David Heintzelman, it even has a map of exactly where I live for shits and giggles. Again, where you got the idea I was afraid is beyond me. You though... first you accuse me of being afraid, then you say how you post anonymously because... you're scared. It seems a bit schitzo.As for Mormons and Catholics not giving money to the cause of denying a group of people their rights... Last paragraph; you make the point earlier in your arguement (albeit the point was completely out of context of the arguement you were then debating) that just because ""African American people have killed white people before. Does that make all black people murderers?"" And so I would say the same of any of the vandalism you're implying is the work of the gay hordes - of which I have heard of none, a link wouldn't hurt your arguement there.And there's a whole debate already devoted to whether religions should pay taxes, where I posted I think a couple times at least. But for the record, they should. Any group that tries to influence policies of a nation, should than have to participate as a member of that society, hence pay taxes. If religious groups want to maintain their tax exempt status, they should excuse themselves from influencing policy. You can't have your cake and eat it to."	FAVOR

While I agree that ""Party A"" and ""Party B"" are unromantic and absurdly bureaucratic designations, this seems more like a matter of taste than of fundamental values. ""Cold, contractual"" language? Well, yes. To the extent that marriage is a legal issue, it is in fact a contract - it involves two people making a commitment, in exchange for which they will receive certain rights and benefits. In New York it is possible for a gay couple to enter into such a contract, only they have to call it a domestic partnership rather than a marriage. In theory, this protects their rights, giving them access to the same benefits associated with heterosexual marriage.My question is this: why do we need a legal distinction between marriage and domestic partnership? If domestic partnership truly protects gay rights, the contract should be equivalent to a marriage contract. If this is the case, what is the significance of the label ""marriage?""

Also many gays who choose a partner of their own sex claim that there are alot of advantages, such as the feelings of love are deeper and feel more real, their desire for sex with that person rather than with someone of the opposite sex is stronger and the sex more satisfying, and I could keep going on and on. Also in certain fields of work, such as fashion design or interior design, the gay guy is usually assumed as going to be good before even showing any other credentials.

2037	gayRights	"Before I begin, the following reminder is in order :In biology, evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. These changes are caused by a combination of three main processes: variation, reproduction, and natural selection.  suppose your reply is an attempt to rebut my assertions: ""Bare in mind that homosexuals that adhere to the theory of evolution must also necessarily adhere to the principle of the theory which posits the propagation of the fittest sexually reproductive species; and consequently has damned the homosexual, for the homosexual doesn't propagate its species.""; And that your reply is in favor of: ""Homosexuals do not pass on their genes directly, however many studies have shown that they may make reproduction more likely for their siblings. In fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. In addition, studies with humans have shown that those people with more older brothers are more likely to be homosexual.The problem with your argument is that you look at evolution from simplistic perspective. Evolution works on helping the individual survive, however in those organisms that reproduce sexually, species evolve in groups. Therefore any characteristic that allows the group to survive will be passed on. There is no definitive proof that homosexuality is one of these characteristics, but the possibility is a strong one.My response:Consider the consequences of supporting the oppositionÕs argument.If homosexuality is a consequence of evolution and such a consequence is for the purpose of the survival of a species; how does homosexuality benefit the survival of a group of its species? We can immediately infer that evolution has removed the homosexual from genetically contributing to its own species. And thus, the genetics of the homosexual are not conducive to the survival of the species, but are destructive of the survival of the species. Therefore, the answer to the question is: Evolution excludes certain individuals from genetic contribution to its species through homosexuality for the survival of the group for the survival of the species. Furthermore, evolution has eliminated certain genetic consequences from genetically multiplying with members of its own species.We can also infer that all groups of species are beneficiaries of the homosexuality of the individuals of their group. Is the author implying that in order for sexual reproduction to propagate the species more effectively, certain individuals must be homosexual so that others will not be homosexual? The author invalidly reasons: ÒIn fact, the prevalence of homosexuality in other species makes it fairly obvious that homosexuality among a portion of the (human) population, must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.Either the author is attempting to insult the intelligence of the audience of this debate or is guilty of granting that which is unreasonable. (I donÕt think the author intentionally does either one, but unintentionally accomplishes both.) If we were to reason according to the example by the author we can arrive at some very interesting conclusions. For example:The prevalence of inbreeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that inbreeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of cannibalism in other species makes it fairly obvious that cannibalism among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of random breeding in other species makes it fairly obvious that random breeding among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of vomit consumption in other species makes it fairly obvious that the consumption of vomit among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole.The prevalence of butt-licking in other species makes it fairly obvious that butt-licking among a portion of the (human) population must be beneficial to the survival of a species as a whole. Just because certain things are true of many other species doesnÕt allow any man or woman to validly infer the same is true of another species. This is called in layman terms: jumping to conclusions.  If you were to reread and carefully consider the assertions of my original argument as re-posted above, you will see that the assertions are subjective on the behalf of the proponents of evolution. The propositions only indicate the inescapable conclusions that the theory supports. I did not assert that the theory of evolution accounts for all that is known of the processes of lifeÕs continuity. Nor did I suggest one should embrace the theory.  I have simplistically explained some of the consequences of some of the supposed complexity of the theory of evolution. And by doing such, I have demonstrated that wherein I reference evolution, I can reduce the supposed complexity of that subject of the theory of evolution to its simple illogical conclusions. And for this reason I am not troubled by an accusation that I view evolution simplistically. (Albeit, my argument is particular, yet I was accused of an universal argument.) Another issue that I must address, before I am accused of neglecting it, is the matter of social contributions made by homosexuals, both tangible and intellectual. Whether a homosexual or any other person has made any tangible or intellectual contribution that enabled/s the survival of a species is purely fallacious. Speculations of what one person has or has not done that conclusively contributed to the survival or destruction of a species are of the fallacy, argumentum ad speculum. We can indefinitely speculate by hypothetical reasoning that which may have been or should have been. Yet, until there is conclusive evidence that would lend itself to the scrutiny of sound reasoning that concludes that any member, or group of any species is a necessary cause or consequence of/for the survival or death of a species, we should not speculate that it is obvious. Can we speculate that we would be ignorant of the law of gravity if Kepler and Newton were never born? Can we speculate that we are alive today because of that knowledge? Yes, we can speculate about anything, but we cannot rationally speculate unto a definitive conclusion that is reasonably useful.One last thing before I end this rebuttal; my rebuttals explain the wherefore of my propositions. Your rebuttals on the other hand evidence nothing that supports your argument. Your arguments seem to always come in the form of either a straw-man, ad hominem, or red-herring fallacy. In fact, there is no argument in your rebuttals. You simply assert whatever you think is ad populum. A little advice: if you are unwillingly to take the time to support your case, I suggest that you forego rebutting the arguments of someone who will take the time. However, I welcome your legitimate attempts to support your views that are contrary or contradictory to my arguments."	AGAINST

2045	gayRights	As this article points out, one cannot reduce the intricacy of our physiological makeup such that we assume social constructs are defined so completely by our genes. Despite various research studies, with findings such as heightened serotonin metabolism in exclusively homosexual males, sexuality is at best a social construct haphazardly linked to one's sense of self and concept of body.Throughout human history, society has undergone such perversions from the natural that the act of copulation has been pathologised to such an extent that most people consider the resulting neuroses a physical drive. If we take a psychoanalytic view of socialisation, we will see that 'sexuality' is constructed and not inherited. From birth, it is drilled into us that the erogenous zones are to be repressed and hidden, this causes an unnatural psychological reaction, resulting in a neurotic fixation with copulation, and genital organs. The repression that occurs is so great, that the manifestation is what we refer to as sexuality. The magnitide of the repression is directly proportional to the societal weight of this 'topic', as is obvious from media content. In nature, such a distortion of copulation does not exist.In conclusion, it is not a case of 'are people born gay?'. For homosexuality is simply a variation on the theme. It should not be pathologised to any greater extent than heterosexuality. 	AGAINST

It would also have helped you realize your last sentence isn't even a sentence.To put more care into rebutting your argument than was put into framing it:A parent can't marry their child because it would be psychologically abusive; the parent is in a position of authority over their child. This is not comparable to relationships between consenting adults.Two- to three-partner marriages have died out not because of wisdom, but because of social equality between the sexes and the rise of industrialization, which means money is no longer represented in land, families are more mobile socially and geographically, and marriages have lost diplomatic value. It means that a rich man no longer needs to collect wives as representatives of the land he's acquired and tokens gathered to assure good relations with his neighbors. Polygamy and polyandry are also usually inequal-power relationships. None of this has anything to do with two unrelated adults who are in love, want to marry, and cannot based purely on the laws of the society they live in. 	FAVOR

2059	gayRights	Certainly, all that you like and dislike is the result of genetic predisposition, however, it is not a result of genetics alone. There is no true question of whether a behavior is genetic or environmentally induced - all human behavior is necessarily a product of both. Genetics establishes which choices are open to you given the context you find yourself in. Naturally, if you have a predisposition to sex with those of your same gender but there are only choices among those of the OPPOSITE gender, if you wish to have sex, you MUST choose among those available to you OR choose not to have sex at all. The same is true of heterosexuals. That you prefer sex with the opposite gender in no way implies you MUST engage in only that type or cannot choose otherwise given different circumstances.That I am genetically predisposed for talent in drawing, painting, or carpentry doesn't imply I MUST engage those talents. So too, that I am genetically handicapped in my ability to understand and perform in mathematics or music or languages in no way implies I CAN'T at least try and enjoy those experiences. One has no choice in one's genetics, however, one always has choice in the expression of those predispositions.That one is born with the sexual organs of a female in no way implies one must have sex with a male and vice versa. It also does not imply one cannot alter one's anatomy to live the life of a different gender or no specific gender at all. Indeed, there are persons who are conceived and born with precisely that non-polar form. My hair is predisposed to grow until the day I die, however, I choose to cut it from time to time. Genetics gave me brown hair, however, I can choose to die it red. Genetics gave me two legs of a specific length, however, I can choose to medically lengthen or shorten them or choose not to use them at all. Genetics establishes the parameters for choice but it does not make the choices themselves.	FAVOR

2063	gayRights	"Does anybody actually read philosophy? Does anyone study ANYTHING anymore? First of all, ""sin"" is far too subjective a word to be used in this case. It is easily confused with notions such as right and wrong, good and evil. Sin implies an act prohibited by a particular religion. There are lots of religions. What is considered a sin in one is not in another. What was considered a sin in antiquity is now considered acceptable. If you want to pick and choose your sins, which many people do, fine. Just know that you have done so and be capable of understanding that as well as applying as much meaning as is reasonable to any act. Or, to be clearer, call homosexuality a sin all you want, but remember that wearing clothes of two different kinds of fiber, interacting with women who are menstruating, eating shellfish, doing work on Saturday, and working for a credit card company are also pretty sinful. If you're going to disregard your own sins and focus on the ones you like, fine, just be aware of your choice to do so.As for right and wrong, the major moral systems, like deontology, founded by Immanual Kant, a staunch Christian, really forms no valid argument against homosexuality other than, ""I don't really like it, it's gross."" Well, you know what, I think eating beef is gross, but I'd hardly call it a sin. Let alone Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, founders of Utilitarianism, who have nothing much at all to say about homosexuality.So, is homosexuality a sin? It depends strongly on who you ask and their biases, which they aren't likely trying to control. Is homosexuality wrong? Well, try taking ethics 101."	FAVOR

The bottom line for Believers and followers of Christ is that sin is what God says it is. Therefore, as far as the question of sin is concerned, it does not matter if gays and lesbians are monogamous or promiscuous, whether they are abusive or kind to one another. Obviously one is worse than the other in a practical sense, but since we can agree promiscuity and other misbehaviors are not characteristic of homosexuality, their presence or absence is not what makes homosexuality right or wrong.If you are a follower of Christ, in order to believe that homosexual behavior is not a sin, you must believe that the Bible is fundamentally flawed and that this secret has been hidden from God's people for all of recorded history. Every mention of homosexuality in the Scriptures clearly calls it a sin--both in the Old and New Testaments. There is no example of a homosexual relationship or behavior that is  not  called sin. No one can say that homosexuality is an expression of God's design without contradicting God's Word.You'd have to accept that despite the revelations God gave to the Biblical authors, He was never able to get past their homophobia throughout thousands of years--until this enlightened generation came along and discovered what God  really  said--nevermind that it happens to be perfectly in line with the direction of secular Western culture.

He isn't even capable of sacrifice. Even seeing his so-called son on the cross didn't cause him any displeasure. He's not human, after all, and cannot suffer. It's not possible.

Since he DID, in fact, apparently coin the word (there IS no concurrent usage of this word in unrelated Greek texts), there is no reason to assume that it refers to gay people as we know them.  There was certainly plenty of objectionable behavior going on in the culture surrounding Paul at the time he coined this word involving ""men"" and ""beds.""  The likelihood is that he was referring to male prostitutes, boy sex-slaves, or temple orgies.  The likelihood is that he was NOT referring to loving, committed, monogamous, covenantal relationships between two people of the same gender, anymore than the male rape discussed in re Sodom and Gomorrah was referring to loving, committed, monogamous, covenantal relationships between two people of the same gender.

2117	guns	"Adam, I appreciate and respect your reasoned and polite discourse.  If I may, I'll work through some of your comments.  Forgive me in advance if I get long-winded.First regarding your 5th paragraph statement ""older interpretation.""  Among constitutional scholars, the older interpretation is the ""standard model"" (individual right to arms), which is similar to the majority opinion in Heller.  The newer interpretations are called the ""collective rights"" (similar to the Rakove, Cornell et al. brief)and the even-newer ""sophisticated collective rights"" (similar to the Brady Center brief) models.  Regarding these newer, ""sophisticated"" interpretations, a statement from Alan Gura's brief (Respondent's brief in Heller) is germane here:  ""Petitioners plainly disagree with the FramersÕ Second Amendment policy choices. PetitionersÕ remedy must be found within the ConstitutionÕs Fifth Article, not with linguistic sophistries or an anemic standard of review that would deprive the right of any real force.""  In other words, if you don't like it, you can repeal it.  But you cannot simply make it go away with sophisticated fabrications of the history and intent of the amendment. Refering to the right to own military small arms as a ""grey area"" (your 2nd paragraph), I argue that it seems grey today mostly because we have made it so over time.  I will get into this more in the next paragraph, but the justification (lawful defense of ""good"" - self, home, community, and nation) for the framers' protecting the right to arms is the same today as it was then.  And the arms they protected then certainly included military small arms.  Thus I would argue that the militia purpose of the second amendment (like you, I don't think the two clauses can be decoupled as perfectly as Scalia suggested) makes clear that the arms most precisely protected by the amendment are military small arms.Getting back to your 5th paragraph, regarding what is to be made of the ""well-regulated militia.""  For one, it is necessary to the security of a free state (state with a small ""s"").  So the SCOTUS (and many amici) argues that it is necessary to our free state, but then the majority pretty strongly decouples that purpose from the operative clause.  That is, even if the militia was not necessary, they argue, the guarantee ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms"" would mean the very same thing.  Generally, I agree with this, but personally feel the two cannot be decoupled quite so perfectly.  Why?  Because the militia IS fundamentally important, and arms are in part what fulfill the militia (and the modern legal mandate of the militia clauses in 10 USCode 311)."	FAVOR

2119	guns	"You brought up a lot of points so I am going to try and discuss each one separately and in order.First of all the Supreme Court decided that the second amendment is an individual right after looking at what the founding fathers wrote in letters, memos, etc.. at the time not to mention the state constitutions that were written at the time. Is it crappy language? Possibly but since the militia is any citizen from 17-45 that includes most everyone anyways so I am not going to say anything else about that.You can purchase a firearm from any person legally able to own a firearm at any time gun shows have nothing to do with it. Also you have to be residents of the same state to make a private purchase of a firearm. So leave the gun shows out of it all the vendors selling there are federally licensed and bound by law to do background checks. Guns in a home are not more likely to injure or kill another person in the home the USDOJ estimates guns are used 2.5 million times a year to prevent a violent crime. since there are only about 1000 accidental deaths a year caused by firearms I fail to see how that correlates to being more likely to get injured or die. Gun owners must know something they have a better shooting record than cops according to the Journal of Quantitative Criminology. This limits it down to concealed weapon permit holders but according to all of the ones I have met all permit holders are gun guys who practice a lot but not all cops I have met are gun guys and some have admitted to only going to the range once a year to qualify. As for the rest of your discussion I agree completely that the biggest problem in the US is the perception of firearms specially the problem with how they are portrayed in the media. I think that a firearms education class would be a wonderful idea and it wouldn't be to hard to teach along side sex-ed(since most kids go through that about then, well at least I did). I am aware that shooting tests are not required to purchase a gun that would completely overload the system and probably make the class so short it would be pointless, but most states do require a class with a shooting test to get your concealed weapons permit. I doubt asking questions would get you anywhere people would just lie that's human nature. But I completely agree with the education part that is why I am getting my instructor certification this summer and I attempt to take as many people out to the range as possible to teach them about firearms and the safe ways to handle them. As for your statement that handguns are cowardly I wholly resent that remark. It is your choice to say you will never own or carry one but to say those that do are cowardly is crossing the line. So that makes every cop in America a coward because they carry a handgun. I admit I carry a handgun on a daily basis because I accept the responsibility for my personal safety I don't leave it up to someone else and I also accept the fact that bad things can happen. I also carry because I will do anything and everything in my power to protect those that I love so why not be able to carry and use the best weapon at your disposal instead of carrying something that might work(such as mace) or study a martial art for years that is completely negated when some punk walks up with a gun of his own and is out of arms reach(right now I know you are saying ""you wouldn't have time to draw or drawing a gun on a drawn gun is stupid which is very true but if you see the attacker coming and you cant get away then you have time to draw and yes I have drawn my handgun in self defense against an attempted car jacking with a knife.) So all in all I really wish we could better educated the kids in this country about firearms but sadly instead of taking a proactive approach the politicians decide to attempt to ban them instead, which you said yourself wont work not to mention its been proven not to work in several countries including England and Australia.

2120	guns	The first article is a very good, unbiased presentation of facts about   guns   in general. It does a pretty fair job of just laying out a few facts without trying to push an agenda either way. I have had it bookmarked for quite some time. In it, they use the smallest finding among 9 studies that show at least 764,000 defensive uses of guns per year. It also states that in 1995 there were a total of 1,400 accidental   firearms     deaths   of persons of any age. Now, assuming (incorrectly, but for the sake of argument) that every single one of those accidental deaths was someone being shot with their own gun, that would still mean you were more than 11 times more likely to be killed by someone else than shot with your own gun. And that is all homicides (16,400). 70.3% of all homicides in 2004 were killed with guns (11,529). (See links below)And that is leaving out attempted murders, which you also included. If you want to include attempted murders (described as aggravated assaults by the FBI studies linked below) then you're talking a whole new ball game. Now the number (  murder   + attempted murder) skyrockets to over 870,000, meaning that you are now over 600 times more likely to be killed or have an attempt on your life than to be shot with your own gun (again, assuming that all accidental gun deaths are someone being shot with their own gun).        The second link you provided didn't really address the question, so I won't make any comments one way or the other about the information in it, if that is OK with you.	FAVOR

College students may be more likely to be influenced by alcohol, drugs, or stress as well.  Personally, those characteristics depend on the person.  However, the more people that have guns, the more people there are that have the means to do damage whether it be accidental or intentional.Guns can misfire.  Someone can accidentally pull the trigger.  Someone may think the gun is not loaded.  A gun could fall into the hands of someone irresponsible. A person influenced by alcohol or drugs may pick up a gun and react to a situation that they would normally ignore.  One way to commit suicide would be easily accessible to those depressed individuals who feel they no longer have a purpose in this world.

(That's probably why you are safer in China -- if they're caught using _anything_ to commit robberies, criminals are swiftly put to death.)Of course, if we put criminals to death with as much fervor as the Chinese do, we could be safe in the streets even _without_ controlling firearm possession.As an aside, I don't think ""Do guns make you safer?"" is the relevant question.  I don't _want_ to be robbed on the street more safely.  I want not to be robbed on the street -- PERIOD!  In _our_ society, letting lots of people carry guns and use them to shoot down robbers seems to be more effective in suppressing abductions, muggings, and carjackings than anything we can expect from the police."

2151	guns	Some of your examples make perfect sense. Banning barrel shrouds seems excessive. Perhaps you are not a gun extremist, after all, just a reasonable gun enthusiast.  But what about one of the more key provisions of the lapsed 1994 federal assault weapons ban - what's so wrong about banning private use of clips with more than 10 rounds?  And with respect to gun shows, it's true that licensed dealers at gun shows must conduct background checks, but individuals not routinely involved in the gun trade ARE allowed to sell their guns without conducting background checks.  It is certainly possible to place additional restrictions on private sellers at gun shows, and thereby to reduce the availability of guns to criminals, etc., without invading private homes.  Yes, illegal gun sales would still occur, but it would be harder.You say you only oppose stupid stuff, and I applaud you for that.  But there are plenty of advocates who oppose all restrictions on gun ownership, just in principle.  That stifles healthy debate, just as much as those who support every restriction they see without thinking about whether it's stupid.	AGAINST

2154	guns	UrsrMajor: Thank you for your explanation of the arms lockers at yourplace of employment. A few years ago I wrote to NRA and proposed a pos-sible answer to the problem faced by   law   and company rules-abiding em-ployees who need to keep arms in their private vehicles when at work be-cause they hunt or proficiency-shoot before or after work and [due todistance] cannot 'double back' to drop or pick up their arms at home...Understadably, most managements have a 'no weapons on company property'rule as they fear a disturbed employee may report to work and shoot theother people there. My idea was to offer employees an 'agreement' inwhich they wud:1. Apply for and agree with the rules regarding arms-in-parking lot.2. Never remove a locked-up arm from their vehicle, carry it into any      building onsite, or 'show it to others' [prospective buyers, etc.]3. Park in a reserved part of the lot that is lit up and watched by se-      curity CCTV cameras [to protect the vehicles from break-in as       well as any sign of agreement-violation. The employee shud al-      ways park there [closer to bldgs?] whether they happen to have      their arms aboard--or not. No one need know and it shudn't be an      issue...4. Any violation of the agreement wud result it loss of the agreement      up to termination...I hoped that such an agreement wud satisfy the arm-owning employees and nervous management. Also, I felt [and still believe] that this lotrule wud be something all cud accept. Want to go   hunting  ,   shooting  , orto show an arm to a fellow employee who is interested in buying it? Gooffsite after work to a lawful place [range, gunshop, private property,etc.] and shoot/demo your arms properly...Aaron Allen..	FAVOR

If you look at the links below, you will see that property crime has been trending downwards in the last few years (    /), while only Assault has risen among violent crimes (    /). Irrespective of the statistical aspects, the fact remains that gun related violence is really very rare in Australia. When people do commit violent crimes, they use   firearms   in only around 15% of cases (    ). In any case, even before the bans of 1996 and 2001 (which applied to automatics, semi-automatic rifles, pump-action shotguns, and high capacity semi-automatic pistols),  there has never been a   law   permitting private citizens to carry firearms of any sort on their person for any reason, so it isn't as if people stopped carrying   guns   or keeping them in their homes to not having them at all.

2158	guns	"My ""no"" response is related to guns and any other body-harming weapon used specifically as defensive weapons. I'm quite in favor of individual defensive devices of some sort - stun guns, tasers, pepper sprays, etc. - insofar as these weapons can theoretically neutralize a perpetrator without permanent damage. I certainly understand the history of weapon carrying and do not have specific criticism of it. It is simply my preference that a dangerous assailant be neutralized - if at all possible - without causing them permanent harm. I believe there is a better way of controlling violence - armed or unarmed - without the injuries inherent to guns and knives or other like tools. It seems to me these alternate devices are at least a hint at substitutes. Certainly others can be developed. It always seems preferable to defend oneself in a way befitting of one who believes there is no place for physical violence in a civilized culture. The nature of guns and other dangerous tools used even for defensive purposes seems to contradict the spirit of such a society. If we cannot show compassion toward our violent assailants, what right have we to the claim of civility?In any event, I fully support the right of a voting american to own and carry a firearm regardless of the lethality issues. It is a guaranteed liberty, but I would hope the majority of americans would choose a non-violent path when practical."	AGAINST

I'm neither 100% one way or the other BUT I did have to research and debate this topic in college...  />   /> It's undeniable crimes are higher in countries with lots of guns.  Yet there's also a grain of truth to the simple claim that when you ban guns only the criminal will have guns.  What you need is a careful middle ground.  Personally I say 1) Guns should be registered and gun holders should be licensed.  You have to be licensed if you own a car because if the wrong person is driving badly they may kill someone, the same should be true with having a gun.  2) Procuring the gun should require some sort of background check and/or waiting period.  Look if you're truly legit you've got nothing to fear from be checked out or waiting a bit longer.  3) Gun training should be mandatory for gun owners and include awareness of the law, gun safety including lock-up and anti-theft, as well as basic gun maintenance and practice shooting.  If you're going to have the gun you should do it right.  4) Military weapons are for the military.  The right to keep and bear arms does not mean any and every type of gun that can ever possibly exist is yours to have.  Ordinary guns - rifles, shotguns, even some pistols, those are fair game.  But the common citizen has no business owning 50mm machine guns, rocket launchers, armor piercing bullets, etc.  />   /> So, I'm saying ""against"" because I don't think it's as simple as make them illegal.

He states that the citizens with no previous criminal records would surrender their guns to officials, leaving them helpless and at a higher risk for being injured.Eggleston further explains that ""Criminals will always continue to break the law and prey on the law-abiding but disarmed citizens.""For the previous arguements that claim ""there are almost no cases where an innocent person has defended themselves with a gun.""Thats bull. According to Eggleston and other statistics, ""every 13 seconds, an American uses a legal firearm in defense against a criminal.""So, for self-protection, guns should remain legal. It prevents overcrowding of prisons, riots, and decreases many injuries. In return health costs are not forced to sky-rocket.To suit the people that believe guns should be completely illegal....I do feel that stricter laws need to be enforced to acquire such equipment.According to the National Rifle Association (NRAILA), in the state of Texas, an individual does not need a permit to buy a hangun, and they are not required to carry registration or a license.This lack of legislation is one of the main reasons for the decrease in gun safety, so if we fix this, Americans can be on their way to a happy, gun legal society.=] "	FAVOR

The NRA position seems to be ""some   guns   are dangerous, but others are not, we should ban the dangerous ones and strictly enforce those bans, but keep sporting   firearms     legal  .""  This is wrong for two reasons.  The first is that all guns are dangerous.  It is not difficult to ruin someone's day with a .22.  This rhetoric leads to a flippant attitude around deadly weapons.  The second reason is that some guns are REALLY dangerous, and that's exactly why we need them.  (Surprised you, didn't I?)  The Founding Fathers didn't consider sport shooting and hunting to be of such value that it required a Constitutional Amendment.  They felt no need to similarly protect other passtimes.  That Amendment was passed because they realized that without arms the people would have no means by which to overthrow the government, and no means to force them to follow the rest of the Constitution.  It's not about safety, or hunting, or sport.  It's about protecting the right of the people to armed insurrection against a tyrranical government.  As such, the ""...Right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.""

How about you actually look up a few of the studies on Concealed Carry (I will leave a few at the end of this for you).

I do restrict this to people who have permits only and are not also   police   officers I found a few instances of officers being drunk with a gun and causing trouble but not an average citizen and officers are allowed to carry guns everywhere and are not seen as dangerous. I canÕt seem to find one and I currently live in Idaho for school, where it is legal to carry into a Bar and to a certain point drink while carrying (the law is fuzzy).  ItÕs the same thing with the whole jealous rage ploy. It doesnÕt happen now so why would carrying onto a public park change that? Do we someone become different people in National Parks and we want to kill everything?? You are just regurgitating the same pathetic ranting that was brought up ten years ago when Concealed Carry Laws where first passed even after ten years there is still no basis to this argument. Do you really believe that if that ever did happen the news would be all over that, they would be eating that up. It would be plastered on every major news station how some idiot with a permit got drunk and shot up some place and he had a permit to carry the firearm legally. Also I ask that you leave out stories with people who happen to live in a state that requires you to have a permit to own a firearm (blatantly against the 2nd I might   add  )  it is not the same thing and does not give a person a right to carry only to own.I am glad you are thinking of buying a few weapons but I do suggest going to range for the proper training first so you donÕt become a danger to yourself and others like you assume everyone else to be. I also thoroughly resent your last statement I am neither an NRA member nor a criminal, you are stereotyping an entire group by the actions of a few which is a very narrow minded way to look at the world.

2200	guns	"Let's examine this from an historical point of view, rather than as an artificial construction.  From U.S. vs. Miller 1939:""...The Militia which the States were expected to maintain and train is set in contrast with Troops which they were forbidden to keep without the consent of Congress. The sentiment of the time strongly disfavored standing armies; the common view was that adequate defense of country and laws could be secured through the Militia- civilians primarily, soldiers on occasion.The signification attributed to the term Militia appears from the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators. These show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. 'A body of citizens enrolled for military discipline.' And further, that ordinarily when called for service these men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time...""From the National Guard Charter:""In addition to the definitions in sections 1-5 of title 1, the    following definitions apply in this title:        (1) ""Territory"" means any Territory organized after this title      is enacted, so long as it remains a Territory. However, for      purposes of this title and other laws relating to the militia,      the National Guard, the Army National Guard of the United States,      and the Air National Guard of the United States, ""Territory""      includes Guam and the Virgin Islands.        (2) ""Armed forces"" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine      Corps, and Coast Guard.        (3) ""National Guard"" means the Army National Guard and the Air      National Guard.        (4) ""Army National Guard"" means that part of the organized      militia of the several States and Territories, Puerto Rico, and      the District of Columbia, active and inactive, that -           (A) is a land force;          (B) is trained, and has its officers appointed, under the        sixteenth clause of section 8, article I, of the Constitution;          (C) is organized, armed, and equipped wholly or partly at        Federal expense; and          (D) is federally recognized...""This last means that the Militia are not the National Guard, but that the National Guard will train and equip the members of the militia.  This law changes where the militia acquire military equipment but does not negate both the duty and right to keep and maintain arms ""...of the kind in common use at the time...""I don't know if you are familiar with the case or not, but the Supreme Court recently delved in depth with these very subjects: the militia and the individual right to keep and bear arms.  The location is:    The reasoning is quite good. Also, this decision left open the government's power to regulate the right, but not negate it."	FAVOR

By allowing CCW or CHP holders (usually 21 and older, not students) to carry at school, you do two things. 1 - you eliminate the safe zone that would have otherwise existed FOR the bad guy. 2 - You take his control of the situation away, by eliminating his knowlege of those that could resist and end his rampage earlier than expected.

First off it has been proven on many occasions that guns are not the problem and that more guns in the hands of Law Abiding citizens actually deters crime. You don't have to take my word for it, do your due diligence and go no further than the FBI crime statistics and right to carry states.Your fear of guns stems from ignorance of facts which is readily displayed in your column. It would behoove you to actually do some research on the subject at hand before your write something that will be published for public scrutiny.[B]Fact 1[/B]. People will still commit murder and rape, regardless if they have guns or not. People will still kill themselves even without guns.[B]Fact 2[/B]. I refer to actual crime statistics and right to carry comparisons. Every state, county, city that has restrictive gun control has a higher violent crime rate than those that exercise right to carry. And again that is based on facts in evidence from the FBI, not some emotional knee jerk reaction... as 99% of the anti-gun rhetoric is wont to be.[B]Fact 3[/B]. Gun control does not solve the problem, education does.Watch these three clips and begin to understand your stance is one of ignorant fear.-      - John Stossel 20/20-      - Canada's failed gun control-      - England's failed gun control|-      Ð Ask Ryan Lee Bergner what she thinks of the idea of disarming the law abiding citizen.-      - Suzanna Gratia Hupp this woman is dead on with her argument[B]Fact 4[/B]. Over 2,000,000 crimes are deterred annually by legally armed citizens. Again these facts can be verified by FBI crime data.I am not going to provide you with the links to the FBI crime data because you can easily find it yourself. Also because you won't pay attention to facts as they are presented. I can pretty much with a 99% certainty guarantee you won't even watch any of the videos provided either No you will continue to cower in fear due to ignorance while good honest law abiding citizens are out there protecting you by exercising their right to carry.The bottom line is you and your agenda are not the solution, you are part of the problem. But you are incapable of admitting or seeing that since you use emotion instead of logic, reason and intelligence guide your through life. Too bad too, you are in a position to actually provide a solution through education, but you chose instead to use fear and ignorance.

Quite frankly, if you are handling a firearm and not using the standard safety techniques, you're asking for trouble.The gross majority of legitimate gun owners respect the potential of their weapons, and things like that don't happen.  The few who don't, however, are the ones who make the news for being stupid.  I'd rather not be lumped in with them.  I know what I'm doing with mine.In real life, having a handgun DOES help.  There have been many stories of defense from a handgun that would not be afforded by any other means.  I just read an article about a man who was stalking a woman for over a year.  She bought a gun.  He broke in.  She called 911 and hid in her bedroom, and he broke down the door.  He then tried to strangle her, and then HIS funeral was planned for that weekend.  Without the gun, it would have been hers.As for the right to own a handgun, that will never   change  .  Or, better yet, if it does, it will very literally cause an armed rebellion.

2250	guns	"True there are other alternatives for students the best and most powerful is situational awareness which includes paying attention to your surroundings and the people close to you. Staying out of a confrontation is always the best solution. But you must remember once you are in a confrontation to be able to use any of the solutions you advised you would have to be very very close as in within armÕs reach which could be too close. Even if you are trained in self defense you still need to be very close when the attack happens, be on steady ground with firm footing, not have anything between yourself and the attacker, and be able for a short time overpower your attacker. If you are that close you risk much more injury to yourself as much as injury to your attacker. Why is it when you draw a firearm the person would overpower and disarm you but you fail to mention that is much more likely when you have to get close as with the weapons you advised. I have taken some of these classes because the last thing I ever want to do is fire on another human being, I am well aware that a gun is not the end all solution to every problem but it is the most powerful last resort and average person can carry. Also it should be noted that pepper spray effects everyone differently and it doesn't always work. I do carry it in my car and in doing so I have been hit with it before to make sure I can still see if I ever have to deploy it close to myself and form personal experience it didn't have that much effect on me other than make me very angry and agitated not immobilized by any means. Also what makes a security officer more highly trained that an average citizen with a concealed weapons permit (cwp)? In most states the same class is required for both licenses. I would also like to know where you got the stat that average citizens are more likely to ""irrationally or accidentally"" shoot an innocent person when according to the GOA fact sheet(    )only 2 percent of civilian shootings involve an innocent person being mistaken for a criminal but the error rate for police is more than 11% thats more than 5 times the civilian rate. Your possibility of ""everyone carrying a gun"" is also not even close to the average in shall issue states is that there is one person out of a hundred who carries a firearm for self defense. This means there might be one in your class or possibly one on your dorm hall. I would also like to know what state you live in because I don't see people getting scared when people carry concealed weapons in malls, grocery stores, restaurants, or movie theaters. Why would allowing law abiding citizens their right to carry on campuses be any different?  Also if a student is arrested twice a month as you put it they would not pass the background check necessary to obtain a cwp in most states.  "	FAVOR

However, if one reads the Bill of Rights starting with the First Amendment, skips the Second Amendment, and reads the remainder, you will see that all of the rights guaranteed are specifically aimed at preventing abuse of the rights of individuals. It would be quite a stretch to imagine the founding fathers would write a document that starts out defining an individual right to freedom of religion, speech, press and assembly; next defines a right that is only collective to a specific group (the militia) and then reverts back to defining the rights of individuals to not have troops quartered in their homes or be subject to unreasonable search and seizure of property.

If someone can be brought down without permanently hurting them, while also keeping the person who is being threatened safe, that's fine by me. I'm not advocating the police blowing away every whackjob with a knife or a pipe. What I am saying is that if someone has a gun, and is threatening to shoot someone with it, or has already shot someone, trying to use less-than-lethal methods to neutralize him isn't a good idea. To put it simply, a gun is the best way to make bad guys go away. There is no room to be fumbling with a beanbag shotgun when someone is executing people. Take Virginia Tech for example. The shooter was going from classroom to classroom shooting people, ""execution-style"", as the media likes to call it. In this case, trying to get rid of him without hurting or killing him would just allow him to kill more people, while the police try to taser him. Back to the self-defense issue - pepper spray and tasers are for the drunk guy from the bar getting a little too friendly. Not for people who are trying to kill you. Again, I'm not advocating replacing pepper spray with a gun. Pepper spray has it's purpose - and so does a gun. If someone is trying to kill you, you want to get rid of the threat as quickly as possible. Less-lethal options will never be as effective as a gun for this purpose.

The first is that a legally justified shooting is the valid measure to use when making a cost/benefit analysis of them. It is not, because of the simple fact that a law abiding citizen who brandishes his gun in self defense is much less likely to fire in the first place because his objective is to drive the aggressor off which many times will not require an actual discharge of the weapon. The second is that suicides are a valid statistic to include in this debate. As I noted earlier they really aren't. The third is that we must accept the fact's definition of legally-justified shooting. Given that in Chicago, if the shooting is done with the handgun it cannot be legally justifiable, we see that this is a very sloppy 'fact' indeed.""Having a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide fivefold.""Just from reading this statistic I can with 99% certainty guarantee that the study that came up with it is neither scientifically valid or reliable. Firstly, the study certainly does not control for legal or illegal gun ownership. Secondly, the study does not control for illegal drug use on behalf of the suicide.

I felt the worst that could happen was they would say no, in which case I would continue to keep things as it was. They were initially suprised because I asked, but were very supportive of the idea after we talked about my reasoning and intent.  They were glad to have someone step up and ask, who would be willing to protect those, who would not, or could not defend themselves.  I do not encourage violence, and I do not look for trouble, but I am cautious and prepared to deal with problems if they occur.  They understood my concern that over the increased attacks on people in ""gun free zones"" AKA: Victim Preserves in the last couple years.

An individual's misbehavior was only ofconcern to the State when other citizens had been harmed by it.      On the other side of the divide were the puritanical republicanslike the autocratic clergyman, Cotton Mather. These men believed allcitizens to be innate sinners, irresistibly driven to dastardly deedsunless rigidly restrained by the State. Their puritan republic, theirCity of God, was like a brittle chain, which a single weak link wouldsunder. In their world, even the slightest mis-step from pious purityhad to be prevented at all cost. Countless detailed laws and regulationswere devised, and then constantly revised, in order to eliminate everypossibility of straying.

Are we to kill our attackers because killing them is the most convenient approach?I'm saying only that all life - threatening to us or not - is precious and we ought not be so casual in the taking of it. In a violent attack upon our person or property, our main goal is to end the violent attack. We can do so by any means possible without regard for any life but our own, or we can put an end to violence in an intelligent way that preserves not only our own life but the life of one's attacker.In any violent event, you can fight savagery with more savagery or with intelligence. I'm saying we ought to choose an intelligent end to violence rather than fall to the very savagery threatening us. By doing so, we in fact advocate the very thing we wish to defend ourselves against.

2387	guns	"Ses asks a few questions:""1. Where does the present day fear of government come from?""It came from a careful reading of history.  Our founders studied ancient and recent (18th century) history, and realized clearly that the most serious threats to life and liberty ALWAYS come from one's own government, rather than from local criminals or foreign states. Think about all the great atrocities of history.  Most (not all) are committed by governments against their own people.  2. Is it a realistic fear (given the various constitutional mechanisms to prevent the misuse of power)? Constitutional republics like the US go a long way to ameliorating those threats.  We've gone 230 years without major governmental threats to our liberties, and have achieved prosperity unimaginable even a century ago.  But complacency is the enemy.  No one ever worries about a fire until their house burns down.  Besides, one of the constitutional mechanisms to which you allude is the Second Amendment.  You can't praise the Constitution and all it's accomplished and then argue that those accomplishments justify changing the document.  3. Is being armed against hypothetical government oppression worth all the harm caused by the misuse of   firearms   ?""This is the true price of living in a free   society   (and it's high).  Many today argue illogically that the price of living in a free society is that we can't be truly free...that we have to sacrifice certain freedoms (like   guns  ) in order to enjoy the other freedoms without fear.  This is a false choice.  Freedom requires constant vigilance, and never becomes something to be taken for granted.  It we must always be willing to pay for it.  The cost of MY freedom is that I must acknowledge yours, even when you do things I don't like with it (like owning guns).  And please remember.  The VAST majority of gun owners NEVER hurt anyone.  To take away our right just because a few abuse that right would be like repealing the First Amendment because some people abuse their right to speak freely.  It would be to treat ALL gun owners as if we were guilty until proved innocent.  And that is anathema in a free society...no matter the practical benefit.  "	FAVOR

2389	guns	First off- thank you for your citation. Now that we are both looking at the same data I think we can be on the same page more. I hope you don't mind- but I went straight to the CDC website for the original data- I could not find 2005? anyway- all the stuff I'll be referencing will be 2004. I guess I couldn't find the 05 data on their site.first look at this- its a study by the CDC re: the effectiveness of Gun Laws (Including concealed carry)        all their research boils down to 'inconsistent results' continuing on with the CDC- less than 1% of all homicides and suicides of school age persons (age 10-24) occur in or on school grounds.also according to the CDC between 1992 and 2006, school homicide rate was on the decline, and school related homicides were perpetrated with a firearm 65 or so % of the time.        Obviously that data is missing VT, NIU, and some other major tragedies, but  the channel to purchase firearms legally is not where the 'violence problem' is coming from.I'll have to dig out the research- I think you can find it in 'gunfacts' (google gunfacts and you'll find a free webbook on it)but you mention assault rifles- prior to the brady bill they were used in less than 1.5% of crimes involving guns. 1.5% They have legitimate sporting and self defense purposes. I'm going to give you a quick sidebar here to help my point- as I don't mean to call you ignorant (I don't think you are) but I think firearms may be a bit foreign to you in their capabilities.Lets look at an AR-15 , the civilian version of the m16 that our soldiers carry. It is legal in many parts of the country, but not all- and fires 1 round per 1 trigger pull (that is semi-automatic)the most standard caliber is 223 remington, which has a military counterpart called 5.56x45- they aren't identical- but for the sake of this conversation we will assume they are- as a 5.56 gun can fire 223 without any issues.it fires a 55gr projectile around 3000 FPS. That sounds fast and powerful- but, did you know that the 55gr projectile going that fast will have less power to penetrate walls and homes than a many pistol rounds? its a function of physics- and again i'll try to find the data- I'm on my way to class right now and don't have time to run through all the numbers but maybe I can paint a picture for you anyway-a smaller  lighter projectile loses energy faster than a slower, heavier one. Its inertia. Like a semi going 35 miles an hour hitting a honda civic going 85. the semi still wins.so what is the point of all that? legislation, though often enacted with seemingly good intentions- is often done by people who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. as me and you both seem very pro-civil liberties, I'd rather they not mess anything else up, and instead focus more on proven methods of crime prevention- like more police.of the handguns you reference- the vast majority are obtained ILLEGALLY- I see what your aiming for here- you want to choke off the supply and the problem will smother itself.Think of prohibition- we choked off the supply of alcohol, and what happened? it became so profitable to deal in it illegally that we gave rise to a massive crime syndicate in the US. The criminals still had booze, they still had guns, and now they had immense amounts of cash to finance whatever they needed.if you outlaw handguns and assault rifles the same thing will happen again. Good people will not have them, and criminals still will- because they exist outside the law. it'll become so profitable that a huge black market (a huger I should say- guns for crime are often dealt illegally anyway) where a situation is created where only criminals can get guns.Penn and Teller had a show called bullshit- or something to that effect, and they did a show on the effects of gun control. one of the things they did, was to go interview violent criminals in prison, and ask if any of the anti-gun laws in place choked supply of guns for them- the answer? no. alls it did was ensure that the people they intended to hurt (assuming not another criminal) was most likely unarmed.In my experience, many people who are anti-gun are so because they are not familiar with firearms and their actual capabilities. If we demystify what they are capable of, I think you, and many other people who feel the same way, will feel far more comfortable around them.	FAVOR

2397	guns	In the grand scheme of things does it really matter? I mean, if someone wants to carry one concealed they will, permit or not. Just like getting a gun to begin with, the laws mean nothing to a criminal and they will carry one regardless of any   law   on the books. Its   the law   abiding citizens that end up getting screwed, or killed because they could not defend themselves against the criminal that could care less. So, lets quit having fear of the unknown. I myself have a conceal and carry(but hardly ever carry it) and part of the process is to take an   education   class and at that point it is the instructors duty to pass/fail as applicable. After this class, the individual should at least know how to handle the weapon safely and responsibly.I feel that if any criminal had any intentions of going into a classroom to do ill will and he knew that it was   legal   and very possible that he could be outnumbered and out gunned by the students themselves, I believe the criminal would think twice if he knew what he was going up against in the beginning. Just like terrorists will probably not hijack a plane again for the fear of the passengers turning on them. Same principal.Then there is the other point. In order to get a permit, the first requirement is that the person be 21. Now, if I am not mistaken people that are 21 and in   college   are pretty much a minority and about ready to graduate anyways, the majority would be the ones under 21 and they cannot get a carry conceal to begin with. So allowing students to carry conceal on campus would be relatively a very small number in consideration to the entire student population.	FAVOR

In a chart compairing Conservitive and Liberal views, there was the following quote; ""The Second Amendment gives no individual the right to own a gun, but allows the state to keep a militia (National Guard). Guns kill people. Guns kill children.""For example, during a year when over 5,000 teens and children died from gun wounds in the USA, in Great Britain, where gun ownership is very restricted, 19 teens and children died from gun wounds. This is very blunt statistic proof that states that gun control thats rectricted to certian personal keep citizens safe and reduces the death by guns. With society and technology proggressing at such a fast speed, the need for barbaric uses of protections such as guns is not nessicary. Guns can be unpredictable and almost 84% of americans have not been trained in gun safety. With the uses of modern day technoloy for individual protection, gun control should only be restriced to select forces of the goverment who are trained in using these weapons.A huge part of american culture is film, and if you were to ask people if violence and special effects involiving guns and other firing weapons were nessicary to a good film, one out of two would say yes. This point gets even more drastic then a 50/50 when i comes to videos games, once you past rated ""E"" there it is almost impossible to find a game with no use of guns. Taking gun use as a ""game"" only provokes the wrong use of these weapons and teaches the brian that guns can be an ""easy way or"" or a ""simple defense"". Not only do adults play games, so do children. My 11 year old brother is a avid player of the new first person shooter Modern Warfare2. This game is fast paced and above all violent, take a look in the video below.Modern Warefare may ahve the rating M but its very common for children to play these games. Some may argue that these ""train to be future military member"" but how does jamming down the ""x"" button until 2 in the moring make you a good soilder in training? Simple anwser, it doesn't. We cannot have guns in the same enviorment as play. Teaching people that firing a gun gives you points is not what they should know. Firing that gun kills another human being and will haunt you for the rest of your life.Infact you may have heard about how many soilders who come back from the war suffer from many phycological issues that in many cases cannot be completely cured. We should leave the guns to the people who need to use them. We as citizens need to be protected, not be armed.

2417	guns	"So it's OK to defend my home with a rifle or a shotgun, but not a handgun? So my 30.06 rifle, which when fired at an intruder would likely go through him, a couple of walls and possibly one of my   children   is a more sensible choice for personal defense than a .40 caliber handgun with jacketed hollow points that are designed not to go through a person? Not to mention the fact that rifles and shotguns require two hands to shoot and I might need one of those hands or may sustain an injury to one of my hands. So how exactly is a rifle or shotgun a better choice again? How does it make more sense?The fact is you are basing your opinion on possibly fear and definitely ignorance of handguns and the tactics involved with their use. They are without a doubt the best defense against a violent attacker for the very same reason they are the number one choice of them. They are small, easy to operate, lightweight, and can fire several rounds in succession with the need to cycle the action to load another round. If you fire at a criminal and miss with a shotgun or rifle and have to load another round, chances are he is going to have that weapon and use it against you in no time. On the other hand, with my gun, I have 17 chances to hit that bastard before he has a chance to get my gun. And it only takes me about 1.5 seconds to load another 16 round magazine and try again - about the same amount of time it takes to chamber another round in a shotgun or bolt action rifle.And to respond to the title of your last thread: ""But who wants to live in Kennesaw?""

Okay, they're round, but that's about all they have in common.    So you live in an area with medium traffic.   Again, at three in the morning, there shouldn't be anyone in your lawn, nor at your door.  Your dogs barking ARE a great deal of protection, regardless of the fact that they bark at you when you pull in the drive, and pee with delight at the mail man.  Not that I'm saying they actually do.     You're missing the point that without warning - a gun is just another item that is laying around.   About as useful as a shoe horn if you have no way of getting to it BEFORE you need it. That story?  Not exactly gives all the facts, nor are they accurate.  In fact, it's really hard to get a straight story.  One article says they came through the front.  Another says they burst through the patio. Some stories are posted on May 4th. Others later, and others earlier.    Not that it means it's not true.  But how did Tom get to his back pack and open it without arousing the suspicion of the gun-man?   Second, if someone bursts through a patio door at a party, do you think it wise to stand there like cows?   Third, why was Tom carrying a loaded gun around in his back pack where he could just whip it out and start firing?Fourth: If two gunmen separate the men and women and keep them in separate rooms, and Tom walks in to find the other guy about to rape his   girlfriend   - what were the other women doing?  A gun requires one hand, at the least. Of course you're going to say ""Having a gun saved ten peoples lives!!!""   You're going to be screaming inwardly that of course it made those people safer.  IF that story is even true.  We don't know.  But.  What happens if Tom had accidentally left that back pack on a bus?  The very point of having a gun is for the ""what if""s"" according to you, yet this is what you say gun control advocates use.   It works both ways, foamy.  I have guns for entirely different reasons.  They don't actually include the ""what if"" scenarios.  Nor does fear of death rule my life so completely that I ignore what common sense (which isn't exactly common) says and the rules of safety and carry my weapons around with me in a backpack.

2425	guns	Kelly,You need to do some research on the origins and the meaning of words when they were written into the Bill of Rights.  You also need to read the newspaper to keep track of current Supreme Court Decisions specifically Heller V District of Colombia where the Supreme Court decided the Second Amendment is an individual right and not reserved for the states so called militias.  Even if we didnÕt have that ruling if you looked up the definition of militia in US Law you would find that it is defined as any able bodied person between 17 and 45 that can be called on in times of crises to repel invasion or enforce the laws of the United States, so we could still carry weapons even with your incorrect interpretation. Going even farther if that didnÕt basically include everyone all ready and you looked into the 1770Õs definition of Òwell regulatedÓ you would find that it is defined as being well equipped/supplied and has nothing to do with regulations or training. You should also look into who actually carries concealed weapons because you donÕt seem to understand who these people are. You would be surprised to find that itÕs not usually who you think. Doctors, Lawyers, Businessmen/women, Judges, College Students, Small business owners and other upstanding members of the community all carry concealed weapons because they recognize that the world is not a perfect place and that the cops arenÕt under any   legal   statute to protect any individual citizen (Warren Vs District of Colombia).  Remember to get a permit in most states you need to go through training, in all states pass a state and federal background check and be over the age of 21(also depending on the state) In the United States the ratio is close to one concealed weapon permit holder to every one hundred citizens.  All of the people I know that are concealed weapon carriers donÕt want to be lone wolf one person swat teams they would rather go about their business in a peaceful manner. They recognize that it might be better to stand by and be a good witness than try and pull some heroic crap and get themselves or others killed but when need be they have come to terms with the fact that they may have to kill another human being (or animal in this case) to defend their lives or the lives of those they care about. So sorry to burst your bubble that you believe that no   crime   can touch you but it can and those that wish to protect themselves are the only ones you are trying to hurt. The verbiage used in the previous comment is absolutely correct, the 2nd Amendment was written to keep the citizens of the United States free of Tyranny from any government including our own according to the Supreme Court and founding fathers. So please before telling someone else they are wrong or made something up do some research and then come debate, we will be more than happy to discuss any other issues you see with this piece of legislation that finally gives citizens the legal standing to uphold a right we already had.

Why do you say ""More than likely they would have been less safe""?  Every day, ordinary Americans defend themselves from criminal attack through the display or use of a firearm.  It's a fact that if a criminal knows his prey is armed, he moves on and looks for easier prey.  It's another fact that if you ban guns, only the criminals will have guns.   And another thought in closing - when seconds count, the police are only minutes away.   Wake up, buy a gun and take responsibility for your own personal safety."	FAVOR

2454	guns	"This is a tough decision for me, but I would have to say students should not be allowed to carry concealed firearms on campus. Let me qualify that by saying I strongly support the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms. In this case, however, there are too many potential problems to warrant such a policy being enacted. First, most people simply lack the proper training to carry weapons. There would inevitably be people who would show off their shiny new pistols, and someone would get hurt. Then, not many people are expert marksmen. If a firefight ensued, I'd wager that some individual would ""go Rambo"" and start shooting everything in sight. If not that, then the stress of being shot at would relegate most people's training to the scrapheap, making them dangerous. In a firefight, one must make a split-second decision to acquire and fire. The stress might cause people to shoot the wrong person. Then you have the issue that possessing a weapon might actually turn someone into a target. Having that weapon might make someone feel invincible and heroic. They may stand their ground in hopes of ""saving the day,"" instead of retreating when doing so might make more sense. this definitely increases the likelihood of the attacker focusing on the individual pointing a weapon at him/her, and killing them.Probably the worst thing about allowing concealed weapons on campus is that it is a double-edged sword. Just like someone can carry for defense, someone else can carry for offensive purposes! Concealed carry could actually make it easier to get a weapon on campus in order to carry out a massacre. I guess the only thing that concerns me about this line of reasoning is that it isn't too hard to sneak a weapon on to most college campuses to begin with...still, I think allowing concealed carry on college campuses is a bad idea."

At NIU the officers responded in under 3 minutes and still 6 people died. That is a phenomenal response time and people still were killed and injured. Not to mention according to the supreme court case Warren v. District of Columbia the police are under know legal responsibility to protect any specific citizen. So actually it is YOUR responsibility to protect yourself so no blaming the government for this one its all on you.These students are also adults you can only obtain a permit in most states if you are over the age of 21. I don't recall any stories where permit holders got mad and pulled their firearms to scare or intimidate off campus so why would it happen on campus.  That is already illegal to do so why does this scenario happen on campus if it doesn't happen off campus when these adults carry everyday. You are right college students have a lot on their plates but since we already proved it is their responsibility to protect themselves i guess they will have to deal. We don't advocate a permit holder to act as a one man/women police force and go after an assailant we just want the opportunity to defend ourselves when we are directly threatened. Also since you have to be 21 in almost all of the states I am not aware of many 21 year-olds that are just out on their own most are college juniors and seniors and they are adults who can already carry in malls, movie theaters, restaurants and in some states bars. They dont cause problems there so why is it that college campuses automatically make every permit holder a deranged killer.  	FAVOR

In plain and simple words, the Second Amendment allows American citizens the option of overthrowing a corrupt government if the need ever arises. The Founding Fathers saw how England tried to disarm the Colonials in order to control them. The wanted to ensure that American citizens would always have the right to own and bare arms, thus the words, ""..shall not be infringed"". The government should always fear the people, not the other way around. Other checks and balances were written in the Constitution for the people to use, but the Founding Fathers knew from experience that only citizens with   firearms   could truely be free. There are many elected people today that would have been hung for treason in the late 1700's. Many citizens today are fed up with the government restricting their freedoms. Treaties being made that are not in accord with our Bill of Rights and laws create ""permits"" and ""licenses"" to exercise our Rights go against preserving our freedoms. Laws are needed to punish citizens who abuse their Rights. Not laws that punish citizens for exercising their Rights. We've seen a great increase in firearm and ammuniton purchases. I don't believe that people are in fear of   crime   as much as loosing their freedom.

2466	guns	  I recently had an epiphany of sorts, thanks to a video I watched by Penn & Teller called Bull$#it! 309 Gun Control.  I have read the Second Amendment and I thought I understood the meaning of the Second Amendment. I have listened to people, so-called experts on both sides of the   gun control   argument, express their ideas as to the meaning of the Second Amendment.  Now, IÕve always understood that the need for and the purpose of the Second Amendment was for the PEOPLE to be able to rise up and defend themselves from a federal government becoming tyrannical and turning against the people.  Anti-gun people contend that the MILITIA referred to in the Second Amendment is a standing federal army or the National Guard and that the Second Amendment provides for same.  The MILITIA, in this case, is viewed by gun proponents the same as an armed populace that can be deployed along with a standing army (just as occurred during the recent Revolutionary War) in the event of attack from without.  However, I would suggest that the MILITIA refers to a standing army that the PEOPLE would have to defend against.  It is the comma after the phrase ÒA well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State,Ó that is at the center of the dispute.  That comma has caused a lot of misunderstanding, in addition to the brief wording of the Second Amendment. Two hundred years later, we donÕt understand the Second Amendment, in part because we have not recently fought a war of independence from an oppressive government.  Additionally, there is the fact that our use and understanding of certain words has changed during the last 200 years.  For example, consider the phrase, Òwell regulated.Ó We may think regulated means Òcontrolled.Ó At the time the Second Amendment was written, regulated meant organized and/or properly trained.  Further, since that time, a well regulated militia of the people, organized and properly trained has not been maintained. On the other hand, the federal government has maintained a well regulated military.  Therefore, consider this interpretation of the Second Amendment:In order for the Unites States to be able to defend itself against foreign attack, a standing army is necessary that the people of the United States may remain a free people, a free state. However, because we are fearful that a central, Federal government, with command and control of said standing army, may, at some point in time become an oppressive government just as the one that we recently threw off, and may deploy said standing army against the civilian population, said civilian population, the PEOPLE, shall have the right to keep and bear arms and that right shall not be infringed by the Federal government.  I cannot ascertain the reason the founders chose to write the Second Amendment the way they did, however, I believe I now know exactly what they meant.  I suggest that you view Penn & TellerÕs video and you will too.  While some people may say that it would be fruitless to go up against our modern military with the small arms available to us, an idea that I may address at a later date, the fact is, the Second Amendment was written for such a purpose at that time and is still in place today. I will say that I find it hard to believe that the founders would have imagined that our military would possess weapons that the people would not have access to, either by denial or impractical to possess.  The fact remains that the government, by   law  , cannot infringe upon our right to keep and bear arms. 	FAVOR

I would extend that to a city, state or nation. Guns allow people to perpetrate violence and kill other people on a large scale and with little effort. Their utility to   society   is negligible compared to anything else that kills at the same rate and yes, I'm assuming the ""millions"" of self-assessed crimes prevented by gun owners are in fact not real and that the true number is much, much lower. Since the most significant effect of your gun is on the people around you I think they get to make the call.My analogy of arming everybody was to refute your logic that we need a new approach to stop school shootings and that approach is to allow students to be armed at school. At some point funding the   police   better was also raised but didn't seem to get much airtime so I focused on why arming a civilian population, especially   college   students, was a bad idea. In general most people's judgment, even those people that pass a background check, shouldn't be used to decide who gets shot. There are alot of people I'd like to see use their drivers license as well, but luckily   cars   have been designed to not kill people. The exact opposite is true of   guns  . The ""cars kill alot of people so why not ban them?"" argument also tries to make an object with high social utility and some harmful side effects like a car equivalent to an object designed to kill people. All the drivers I've ever encountered have never tried to argue that the lethal ability of their car will deter   crime   and everyone should rest easier knowing they can run over anyone they sense is a criminal threat. Yet somehow you argue your personal ability to kill people with a gun should be protected because it involves the same level of judgment as operating a car.Please take the foreign country examples to their logical conclusion. No developed country (those with a reasonable chance to enforce things like a ban on   gun sales  ) has a gun or violent crime rate even approaching the US. The UK, Germany and Australia are all good examples. In the short term economic factors drive crime much more than gun ownership rates. And I'm sure stabbings went up as gun availability went down. I'd have to argue India, Mexico and South Africa are all developing countries where the rule of   law   is still evolving.

I can only find statistics that show that permit holders are at least 100 times less likely to commit violent crimes, including those with guns.And if   gun control   is a   crime   and safety issue, then why does the anti-gun agenda continuously ignore credible statistics (not from the NRA) that show that gun control does not lead to a decline in violent crime? In fact, FBI statistics show a tendency in the opposite direction. Despite hundreds of federal and state laws, criminals continue to find ways to get guns. But you want me to give mine up so that only the criminals can be armed? I think I'll pass, thank you very much. Can you also provide the questions that were asked that pointed to the ""fact"" that the majority of Americans do not want guns on our streets? My guess is the question had nothing to do with legal gun ownership by law-abiding citizens who were subjected to background checks, state-mandated training, and hundreds of dollars in fees to obtain a legal carry permit.""No matter how many malls, schools, churches and public gatherings get attacked by gun wielding maniacs...""Gun wielding maniacs is right. There are approximately 1.5 million defensive uses of   firearms   every year. There are a couple of mass killings per year by ""gun wielding maniacs."" And these gun wielding maniacs will acquire their guns legally or illegally, whether you strip me of my right or not. But I should be left completely defenseless? I can't see a sane argument for that. "	FAVOR
2501	guns	I have a couple of questions on the statistics here, as it is not clear to me. First, does the DOJ include the 1.5M defensive uses in their calculations even if the   crime   is prevented, but still reported? For example, a gun owner pulls his gun in self defense, the perp runs, but the gun owner still reports it? Also, what about the   legal   use of a firearm to that injures or kills a perp, so the crime doesn't actually get committed? This would affect the overall statistics. I didn't read the whole PDF, so I'm not sure.Second, if there are 360M people in the U.S., how does 1.5M defensive uses per year equate to one use by every citizen every five years? (1.5M X 5 = 7.5M, unless my calculator is broke). You can't include the entire population in one statistic and only a portion in another and then try to compare them. You are saying that 62.64M people are victims of crime, but forgetting that not all of them use their weapon in defense.The actual percentage of victims that use their   firearms   in defense is around 2%, according the statistics you quoted (1.5M defensive uses / 62.64M crimes committed = 0.0239 or approximately 2%). That is, of course, assuming that all defensive uses are reported and included in the statistic of crimes committed. The assumption that gun possession keeps you safer is not false. 40% of criminals say they would not attack someone they believe to be armed. That equates to   guns   being a deterrent.And if there are 1500 accidental gun deaths per year on average but there are 1.5M (or approximately 1,000 times more) defensive gun uses per year, how exactly am I more likely kill myself or a loved one with my gun? I admit I was poor at math in school, so maybe you can help me there.And according to CDC statistics accidental deaths of ALL types rank 5th in the U.S. as a cause of death, with firearms being 8th among accidental deaths. That's pretty far down the chain. How about we focus on the first 4 causes of death, and then the first 7 causes of accidental death? That would reduce the mortality rate in this country significantly, while focusing on   gun control   would barely be a drop in the bucket.At the risk of repeating myself, don't confuse LEGAL gun ownership and use with ILLEGAL gun ownership and use. Those that possess a carry permit in the U.S. commit crimes at a much lower rate than the general population, even lower than   police  . For example, Florida has 1.5M carry permit holders, and have revoked 166 of them since 1996. That's about 0.01%. If only the rest of the general population was that   law  -abiding. The statistics for the rest of the country are similar, but this is one I knew off the top of my head.	FAVOR

(I would prefer a civil war to UHC however)Obama was indeed elected by a vast majority... a vast majority of easily convinced sheep people who went along with the trend for various reasons.  This   election   was easily the most intense and divisive I have ever lived through.  Many Americans voted for a socialist president (yes, I can rightly call Obama a socialist) against their true values.  Laziness or hatred of Bush or race caused a lot of people to vote against what they really wanted and valued in our country's leader.  That is why people are starting to go against him now, after following through with a few of his socialist promises (UHC).Personally, I wouldn't say the federal government turned on me. I would say America turned on me.  I am fighting to keep my rights and still people support socialism in America.  If anyone wants socialism, please feel free to move to a country that already has it in place.  Here, socialism is unconstitutional.  Yet I stand by and watch my freedoms disappear.As far as Obama and Pelosi not being out to control the world... why do people pursue   politics  ?  Oh, right.

Criminals, terrorists, and mentally ill individuals can buy military grade, as opposed to ""style,"" as in, military looking, weapons, in amounts limited only by the amount of cash they have.  This law doesn't show much sign of changing.  Laws requiring background checks and such will drive those killers, and their funds, to the black market, allowing it to expand, rather than allowing growth in the legal economy.  This will increase the power and standing of illegal organizations and increase the amount and variety of goods available.  It's a terrible idea.  It does, however, have a convenient side effect.  It gives the Federal government a list of all legal gun owners in the event that it should ever confiscate all guns.As far as ""temporarily insane,"" untrained teenage lunatics wandering around shooting people, we aren't saying that all students should be allowed to concealed carry at all.  The permit for concealed carry is actually pretty tough to get, requiring actual classes be completed and passed, criminal background checks, etc.  All of that is fine for a concealed carry permit, as opposed to actual ownership, because criminals even though criminals won't bother with the permit, idiots will, and those who would engage in drunken gunfights would be weeded out.  Even tougher permits could be required for concealed carry on campus.  As far as arming teachers, why shouldn't a teacher have the right to defend him/herself?  I don't know the South Africa case, but I'm sure the tension in the classroom had to be pretty high for a teacher to believe a student was pulling a gun out.  Someone who had taken classes to get a concealed carry on campus permit would have known to tell him to freeze and put his hands up before firing.  The gun is for last chance situations, for example if the firearm is being brandished or fired.  You also make the absurd assumption that parents wouldn't want to send their children to a school that gives them the ability to defend themselves, as opposed to sitting helplessly awaiting execution, in the event of an emergency.  That could easily be put to the test.  Give schools the choice to allow or disallow concealed carry, and see which schools attract students and which do not.In your final agrument, you make a feeble attempt to justify a confiscation list, that would allow the government to remove the citizenry's last defense against tyranny."

The pro gun side doesn't want bans and further restrictions. The problem is both are missing the mark. The problem is violence.

For starters if you take the 2nd amendment approach, what part of ""the rights of the people shall not be infringed"" do you fail to understand. Next, States are the authority that regulate the rules for Concealed Carry permit holders, and should apply to all areas not specifically prohibited by each state.  If a National Park is in a state that allows concealed carry then it should include the parks as well.  Aside from the obvious, concealed carry is   legal   in a growing number of states, so for those ""afraid"" of coming into contact with or being exposed to a gun, you already are on a daily basis in about 40 + states the last time I checked. I personally carry during majority of my waking hours, both in my own home and in public, with the exception of when at work or   church  .

I will still carry a gun either openly or concealed depending on the circumstances and location, if for no other reason than I still can, and in my opinion a right not exercised is a right lost by default!

One might use the quote: 'None of the studies can prove causation. They merely examine the statistical association between gun availability and homicide.'  One might use this quote as IF the Hepburn and Hemenway study DID find causation, they would AGREE with that causation, which according to their own POV, they WOULD NOT.  May I suggest that the ""causation"" mentioned is to keep the researchers from having to face endless witch-hunts?  You know, when you disagree, sometimes people tend to get violently 'passionate' with you.Of course when one side uses a document like the Constitution as the basis of their moral arguments, a document written by white slave-owners who imposed martial law to restrict the freedoms of millions... then one will always be correct in their assumptions of safety and freedom behind the barrel and the bullet."

2542	guns	The numbers of   guns   in the United States vastly outnumber the population of the country (300 million).  I am shocked to read news   headlines   mentioning the incidents involving young people and handguns. Nowadays it's not uncommon to read about   teens   killing other teens and adults in gang shootings, robberies gone bad, carjackings, or botched drug deals.   The recent-history murders of   church   officials around the country and   college  -campus massacres of innocent people should serve as a reminder that gun violence in the hands of unstable people has gone too far, and government must do something to at least cut back on this pandemic before it consumes all of us.  I believe that the Second Amendment of the   U.S. Constitution   is not a carte blanche to allow anyone uncontrolled access and use to   firearms  , but rather is a protective measure to ensure the protection of citizens during times of war at home.  In other words, I do not believe that the Constitution writers would have allowed unstable or questionable persons to have access to these weapons of mass destruction.  And neither should we.  	FAVOR

They're not going to whip out their guns and wave them around with the safety lock off. Most legal gun owners have acquired their weapons legally BECAUSE they have the training to show for it, and are psychologically sound individuals who have the ability to stay calm and level-headed in a time of crisis. -In case you haven't noticed, gang members don't bother leveling and shooting. They run around blindly shooting without looking. And you wonder why innocent people get hit by stray bullets. -Did you ever consider the many people whose lives have been saved because they happened to have a gun? A would-be thief is not going to mess with you if you've got your gun trained on him. Hear of the 85-year-old woman who held a gun on a burglar and made him call the police? She could have been injured or killed had she been unarmed.-Virginia Tech -- had there been a student or teacher on campus who had had a gun, they might have been able to stop the killer. But no, everyone had to wait for 33 people to be shot before 'help' arrived. Last but not least, consider the 2nd amendment, which protects the individual's right to own a gun. And in case you people didn't know, the 2nd amendment is an integral part of our Constitution.

2546	guns	" A constitutional right to bear arms is not subject to reasonableness standards A right to bear arms is constitutionally enshrined. As such, it cannot be qualified for the purpose of practical considerations. Legislatures cannot regulate parts of it according to some ""reasonableness"" standard; the right is immutable. The earliest published commentary on the Second Amendment by a major constitutional theorist was by St. George Tucker, also known as The American Blackstone. He authored a set of law books in 1803 that annotated Sir William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England (discussed at length later, under Colonial Rights), for American use, and that formed, in many cases, the sole legal written works read by many early American attorneys.[44] Tucker, the leading Jeffersonian constitutional theorist, was widely read, even by those who rejected his interpretation of the Constitution. In footnotes 40 and 41, he wrote: ""The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4, and this without any qualification as to their condition or degree, as is the case in the British government.""[4]"	FAVOR

2548	guns	For too long, people who have been safely and responsibly carrying   firearms   for personal protection in states containing   national parks   have been required to surrender that right at the park borders.  The newly enacted Coburn amendment allows carrying on national park lands only under the same laws and restrictions as are currently in force in surrounding state lands.  There is absolutely no reason or evidence to expect   law  -abiding gun-carrying people to suddenly become crazed killers or poachers simply because they cross an invisible, imaginary boundary line.  On the other hand, there is every reason to believe that   the law  -breaking people who currently carry illegally off of park lands will give a bit more thought before committing crimes on park lands now that potential victims have the potential of fighting back. If the National Park Rangers truly believe that self defense is not an issue in national parks, why is every Ranger I've met armed?  I know the answer to that and so do the people from Freedom States Alliance.  The only Rangers who opposed the Coburn Amendment were the politically appointed management wonks in Washington, DC.   Two national parks are within an hour's drive from my front door.  I regularly come into contact with Park Service rangers and speak with them on a personal, unofficial basis.

2549	guns	 The question of what they mean to Americans is simple in my experience. It is a matter of taking care of yourself. I do not rely on the government to feed me, drive me to work, tell me what to believe, what to read  or what to say so why should I rely on them to protect me? I grew up in the Long Beach and Los Angeles area and I was in college there during the Rodney King Riots and I can tell you that the people who fared the best were the ones who were armed and made sure the looters knew it! I grew up in a household that had many firearms (some of which were fully automatic as my father was with the Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement for 30 years). Not once were they ever misused. When the night fell and we could see the fires we readied our arms and kept vigil through the night in case the rioters came near. The police could not help us if someone showed up (the police did a valiant job but were horribly outnumbered). It was up to us and we all knew it. The only restriction I agree with is that automatics should be licensed because in the hands of the unskilled they can have unintended consequence. I do not have a problem with hi-cap mags though as they level the playing field when a civilian comes up against full auto firing felons. I do not believe the police should use full auto either as you should only shoot as quickly as you can aim. Criminals do not have to account for every shot they fire but police do. Give them hi-cap semis just like we civilians have. I have had extensive experience with full auto but would prefer a semi in a fire fight. I worry when the government starts telling me what I can and can not have. They say they want to get guns out of the hands of the criminals, well so do I! But how is limiting the rights of law abiding people going to do that? Criminals break the law - that is why they are called criminals. I would rather have everyone in a room be armed than only have the criminals have weapons. 	FAVOR

They'll ""be afraid to visit   national parks   knowing that people can have guns?""  How can they now find the courage to even travel to those parks knowing that they must traverse state lands where people are allowed to carry guns?  How can they manage to control their fear while shopping in local stores, walking local streets, or sitting in local theaters knowing that the state already allows people to have guns.  In my own county in a state which has had   legal   concealed carry for only the past five years, approximately 1.54% of the population has a concealed carry permit.  According to a local deputy, when one subtracts those under age or with criminal records, it's closer to 5% of the eligible population. That means that one out of every twenty adults one meets might be legally carrying a gun.  And no problems are in evidence.

Lynchings and other acts of injustice based upon racial difference occurred well into the twentieth century, so it is a misrepresentation of the facts to say every individual had the right to bear arms for self-defense.

2563	guns	To begin, letÕs look at the issue again. The issue is whether or not students should be allowed to carry handguns on college campuses. Two of the three examples you have cited are of adults carrying handguns to protect the children and two of the three examples are also citing instances on high school campuses, not college campuses. So to take out the two misleading examples, we are left with an example of law school students using their personal guns to stop a ÒrampageÓ. In this one instance cited, personal handguns were of help in a dangerous situation. And this argument is not to say that handguns are not helpful in certain situations. But when students carry handguns on college campuses, the level of danger is increased. In such a manner, any student may pull out their weapon and use it as a threat legally because handguns would be legal. With handguns legal on college campuses, students have the means to shoot and kill, to take away someone elseÕs life, right at their fingertips. Self-defense is one thing. But when does the power of carrying a weapon overcome self-defense?Secondly, a Òresearch pollÓ from 2000 found that 85% of Americans found it appropriate for a principal or teacher to use a gun to defend students. It is true. The majority of Americans want the lives of their students at school protected. But 85% of Americans have stated that they believe it is appropriate for a principal or teacher to do so. Not a student. If the students are the ones with the weapons doing the shootings, is it really sensible for the students to be allowed weapons legally at school?	AGAINST

2566	guns	First off- Kudos to you for commenting on a thread 8 months later. I'm not joking either, that definitely shows your passion for your point of view. I respect that immensely and thank you for input, however much I disagree with it.With all due respect, I won't ask my classmates a damn thing, nor do I care about your suggestion of surveying them. I do not ask them about their activities, and they won't ask me about mine. So long as everyone is operating in a manner that is non damaging to other people and is   legal  , I could care less.And who grants someone the right to shoot at will? are you assuming because you have a gun you'll use it? Do you run pedestrians down with a car when your driving because the opportunity exists? that is a farce of an argument and you know it. If it were true, legal concealed carry permit holders would be committing mass homicides in droves already- and that just does not happen.and who said arm all students? where did that come from? no where. you invented that. No one is advocating arming everyone. it is not a logical conclusion to my argument or any argument I have seen presented on behalf of the pro-gun community. Arming everyone is a setup to your argument about criminals and   guns  . Its leading and you know it. I have more respect for you than that, don't try to slip that by me either- its kind of insulting.Why not let those people who are deemed capable by the state and pass the necessary background checks, classes, and other required steps to arm themselves- as they can everywhere else? that is what I'm suggesting. Your arguing fiercely, but your not arguing against my points. Your fighting points that your making up. and if all this violence would erupt as soon as guns were introduced, why hasn't that happened at the schools that allow students concealed carry? its been years since the students have been able to exercise their rights, and yet no incidents. . .your new approach isn't new. it failed in Australia, England, south Africa, Mexico, India and Germany. Your idea of getting rid of all guns is completely unrealistic and nothing more than an impossible fantasy. Your suggestion will fail as miserably as prohibition did.Self defense by the way, does not remain intact. Nor do my constitutional rights. Your right about criminals still having access to guns- and   military   grade ones. Why not disarm good citizens?  You want me to defend myself with a knife or a   taser   against criminals with long guns and handguns? Really? thats your idea of adequate self defense?Citizens are not going to be armed 'likewise' to the military. another made up argument on your part. You show me where citizens can buy   law   rockets, grenades, claymores, gaos,  c4, and whatever else. If bans worked- Mexico wouldn't be having the violence they have. And I know you followed the news to know that despite what early reports said, most of those guns confiscated did NOT come from US civilian markets. The military stuff came from corrupt officials outside of America doing backdoor deals for weapons given to those countries by us for their national defense. Your suggestion does nothing to fight corruption. I do not think that the availability of guns as you describe it will ever dry up. Corrupt people in key places will always exist- as will human ingenuity. A determined person can make some really nasty weapons pretty easily with things available around the house that can kill or hurt an awful lot of people. You can't legislate away all of these things. It is impossible.lets assume your right- and reducing   gun sales   will limit criminals- then why did fatal stabbings go up in England after a gun ban, when violence across the board ALSO went up? if knives are so much less lethal, why did it kill more officers?Your willing to trade our rights and our lives for a future Utopian dream that will not, i fear, ever happen. I cannot agree with your assessment. We both want the same thing- less criminals committing acts of violence, we just disagree on how to accomplish it. I have yet to see anything that is remotely convincing to show me that guns cause higher levels of violence. Everything that seems to even begin to point that direction has imaginary statistics and completely misleading (intentionally) statements.I feel your assessment shows a lack of trust in your fellow citizens- and one I do not agree with.

2568	guns	I fail to see how this is different then obtaining a concealed weapons permit in most states already? All states require a background check, most require you to have no history of mental illness(I am assuming this is all states but I couldn't find statutes for all 50 states so I am just saying most), you must be 21 or older, and most states require some type of   firearms   safety course before you can get a permit. So the chance of gang members and those that are mentally insane getting a permit anyways are incredibly remote if not impossible already. You are just adding another layer of ridiculous requirements onto something we are supposed to have a right to anyways. You also forget that those who wish to carry a weapon illegally on campus will do it no matter what   the law   says, so those that are going to get permits aren't the ones you need to worry about. Those gang members and/or mentally insane wont go through all those requirements they will just carry on campus anyways, they don't care what the laws are. If they are planning on hurting or killing someone why would they care about the laws saying they aren't allowed to carry a weapon on campus?As for the population numbers you must remember that the ratio of concealed weapon permit carriers and normal citizens is about 1 out of 100. So while I believe campus would be safer if over a 1/4 of campus carried as you propose it would never happen. Also you have to take in account the fact that you have to be 21 to obtain a permit so that takes about 80% of the student population out of the equation to begin with. That doesn't even bring in the part about why you are restricting the rights the other half of teachers (or 3/4 of students). What makes them any different from the others? Also why do you believe teachers deserve their rights more than the student body? Like I have said on here before what makes a 27 year old first year teacher different or more deserving of their right to defend themselves than a 25 year old veteran coming back to school? I am not saying its a completely bad idea its just that everything you stated is already being done at a state level so why repeat it.

Just like someone can carry for defense, someone else can carry for offensive purposes! Concealed carry could actually make it easier to get a weapon on campus in order to carry out a massacre. I guess the only thing that concerns me about this line of reasoning is that it isn't too hard to sneak a weapon on to most college campuses to begin with...still, I think allowing concealed carry on college campuses is a bad idea.Double edged sword?

There has not been one recorded incident of a CCW initiating any type of massacre. Not one, your fear is unfounded. Illegal carriers tend not to pay attention to those things called laws. That's why law abiding citizens with a CCW are so effective a deterrent. Now think about this real hard, you want to ""make a name"" for yourself by killing as many as you can then capping yourself. Now if your intended victims are all unarmed and you know this, then you know that you can succeed and since schools are stupid because they tell students to play dead or not fight back. In other words instead of teaching survival skills they are training students to be lambs at the slaughter. Anyhow so since there is no credible threat, they can go on killing spree and most likely succeed.Now the same scenario but the rules are changed in that the targets you have selected have the right to carry. You don't know who is packing and who isn't. Your odds of getting far are pretty slim. Slaughter is stopped before it even happens, and not one person had to pull a gun. Just the thought that armed resistance was a real possibility would be enough for any rational person.Oh and last bit, almost every massacre in the United States and Europe (Germany just had another one... and they have strict gun control!) has happened in a gun free zone. Think about that next time you go someplace where guns are not allowed..."	FAVOR

Is killing someone with a gun somehow worse than killing them with a rock?  If you ask me, the thought of killing someone by bludgeoning them to a wet and messy death seems far more nefarious and evil than bending a finger at 17 yds. Yet the finger-bending has attached to it a far stiffer sentence.  Yet the opposition calls these laws ""common-sense"".  And we buy into it? Really?""But, what about acquisition laws for felons or the mentally unstable?"" you might ask.I am on the fence here.

I grew up in a house with many firearms, some automatic, and never had an incident where either I, or one of my sisters, ever misused one. We were taught at an early age to respect our folks and obey them and that meant not to touch the firearms without their permission. I am currently a Loss Control/Risk Manager and can tell you that there are many dangers in your home that pose a greater risk to your children than firearms. I remember watching a mother on a talk show talk about how her teenaged stepson broke into the parents locked bedroom and retrieved their pistol and accidentally shot her son and paralyzed him. She said that both of the children were victims and the fact that the pistol was in the house was a tragedy waiting to happen. Is there no personal responsibility anymore? One thing I do not understand about the gun argument is that many of the anti-gun people who would rather see 100 innocent people deprived of the right to a firearm if it could prevent 1 criminal from misusing it are the same people who would rather see 100 criminals go free than see one innocent person go to jail.

Somehow they advocate the need for a stronger state for enforcement but actively work to limit its power through funding. It's becoming clear that no level of reasonable funding can keep   guns   out of the wrong people's hands, so let's be practical and take them off the street altogether.To your point on self-enablement: If you ask your classmates if they want you armed with a handgun in class, in the hallway, in the library and on campus paired up with your personal judgment of who poses a threat to yourself or anyone else AND granted the right to shoot at will, I will bet you a large sum of   money   they will overwhelmingly vote ""no"". A graduate student at UNC-Chapel Hill started picking off pedestrians downtown with his gun and had to be shot dead by the   police  . Good, smart choices were lacking by him.After you lose that vote, go ask your local patrolmen assigned to cover your campus if they prefer all students to be armed. If your logic is sound then they should welcome the wave of deterrence that spreads over campus. Instead, they will envision the fistfights at parties that escalate into gunfights, the drunken arguments that turn into shootings, the accident rate in dorm rooms as guns are accidentally discharged while being shown off, etc. etc. If there's one thing most   college   students lack it's a consistent supply of good, smart choices and the police on campus can cite example after example.So I agree with part of your posting - we need a new approach. That approach is banning handguns and most high powered ""assault"" rifles. Columbine was an example of how easy it is for disturbed people to not be prevented by any reasonably enforceable system from possessing the weapons needed to kill scores of people quickly. So let's stop trying to enforce unrealistic permits and background checks and just admit that it's a bad idea to let the average person possess most deadly weapons and ban their sale altogether.Your right to self-defense, by the way, remains intact. Get all the tasers you want. Load up on pepper spray and knives. You won't have the ability to kill 6 people in quick succession, but you can protect yourself. If you declare that only criminals will have guns under this proposal then I'll say you're right, but currently only criminals have   military  -grade machine guns, grenades and explosive weapons but that doesn't mean we need civilians to be armed accordingly. The trade off under a ban is that fewer criminals will have guns and their use in escalating violence from simply causing injuries to causing multiple deaths will be reduced. The process of getting guns off the street will go faster than I believe most fear - there will be heavy incentives to go after known criminals who haven't been convicted simply to put them away on an easy-to-prove gun possession charge. As black market guns become more valuable, they won't be ""wasted"" on random acts of violence. They will fall into the same category as weapons we currently reserve for the military - and noone would be afraid that common criminals would use them for everyday crimes or that mentally unbalanced people will buy them from a store or steal them from an acquaintance.

Fistfights don't turn into gunfights but rather are avoided entirely--The kind of people who get into fistfights rarely get licenses.

2633	guns	Let me take this point by point:[b]ÒCongress passed dangerous legislationÉÓ[/b]Where is the proof that this is dangerous legislation? There are millions of legally armed citizens in this country. If you are not in one of the few states that refuses to issue carry permits to   law  -abiding citizens, then you have been in line at the grocery store behind someone carrying a firearm legally. You have bumped into them while walking down the street. You have sat next to them at a red light during your commute, or while on vacation. Do they pull out their   guns   and fire shots in the air while screaming, ÒYeeeeee haaaaaaawÓ? No. Why? Because those who choose to legally arm themselves (i.e. carry permit holders) are among the most law-abiding citizens in our nation. The   crime   rate among permit holders is a fraction of the crime rate among the rest of the population. This is a fact, and it is undisputed by the Brady Campaign.[b]ÒThese members weakened   public safety   and stripped Americans of their right to enjoy   national parks   and wilderness areas free from the threat of armed citizens...Ó[/b]This is nothing but fear-mongering and paranoia. Again, people in this country arm themselves on a daily basis all around you, and it is no way affecting your safety. This idea that   legal   carry permit holders walk around with an itchy trigger finger just waiting to blast a hole in the first thing that moves is not only stupid, but in complete contradiction of facts and history. The thing that the anti-gun agenda leaves out of every one of the satements like the one above is that there is a distinct difference between LEGAL carriers of   firearms   and those that do so ILLEGALLY. Banning the legal carry of firearms in our National and State Parks would change nothing. And thatÕs the problem. There are already people who carry in our parks. The problem is that they are doing so illegally. Allowing those who carry legally to do so in our parks will deter crime, not encourage it. [b]ÒOur country was founded on the principal that we are a nation of laws and yet the gun lobby is seemingly advocating anarchy over our own government when it comes to the gun issue.Ó[/b]I hereby challenge Ms. Slovenski to produce one notable instance where the NRA, Gun Owner of America, or another major pro-gun lobby has advocated anarchy. All we ask is that you treat the 2nd Ammendment with the same respect as the 1st, or the 4th, or the 5th. You donÕt want those others trampled on, so why choose the 2nd?[b]ÒIt is absolutely astonishing that while Americans are swamped in   credit card   debt and now have better protections for their economic security, our very own personal safety is at greater risk traveling to our national parks,Ó [/b]See above. There is still no basis in fact. People carry legally every day, with very few instances that warrant concern. You have much more to worry about from gang members and other thugs who will carry everywhere regardless of how many laws and statutes are enacted. YouÕre not preventing crime by limiting access to guns by law-abiding citizens. [b]ÒDespite concerns raised by park rangers, Congress put the safety of national park visitors and wildlife at risk by allowing concealed, loaded firearms at 388 of 391 national park sites. CoburnÕs amendment overturned a Reagan-era regulation that allowed unloaded and safely stowed firearms in national parks.Ó[/b]ThereÕs really not much of a difference here. Guns today are much safer than guns during ReaganÕs administration. My personal carry gun has no less than 4 external safety mechanisms that ensure, even when loaded and a round is chambered, that you do not fire a round unaware, or by accident. And that doesn't include internal safety mechanisms.  [b]ÒGun proponents continue to say that prohibitions against carrying guns in national parks violates their Second Amendment rights. But even Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority in the Heller case that stripped D.C. of its handgun ban, stated conclusively: ÔNothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings.ÕÓ[/b]I donÕt see how a National Park can be included in the definition of Òsensitive places.Ó National Parks are frequented by the same people who are in your neighborhood, that walk next to you on our streets.

2643	guns	Ironman- respectfully- I disagree.As Sevesteen pointed out- purchasing a firearm is a relatively intense process. By me for instance, to purchase a firearm (handgun specifically) I must go, pay for the firearm, pass my NICS check upon completion of my 4473, receive a green certificate, drive to the pistol licensing unit, turn in the ticket and have my permit amended to reflect the additional handgun, then go back and show my dealer that the pistol is now, in fact on my license. Only then can I take possession of the firearm.As a result of working within so many constraints- this often takes several days to accomplish, and as the Licensing unit by me is small, people often are required to miss work to accomplish the task. The hours do not even run a full business day, and are open 4 days a week instead of 5.Waiting periods, and additional steps like the ones I described to not deter the mentally deranged, as you described. Those people are committed. They are, for lack of a better term, fanatical.People who do get deterred are good, everyday Americans who want to take up handgunning for sport or protection.

Shouldn't this study have concluded that a gun in the house, when shot at somebody, is almost always used to shoot a criminal if this was true? How could guns be killing innocent people, even suicidal people, at such a higher rate than criminals? Suicidal people should be a minor blip in the results compared to criminal deaths if the NRA claims are true. But they're not.Ask your insurance company what your life insurance and homeowners rate is once you keep a gun in the house and compare that to no gun. Keep in mind they don't pay out for suicide. They will raise your rate on the impassionate, calculated risk that the gun will be used to hurt/kill someone by accident to a much higher degree than the gun will lower your risk of theft or assault.

2666	guns	First off, have you ever heard of fighting fire with fire? Certainly there are way to many criminals with guns. That is ONE of the reasons I own guns. I have been a gun owner for 39 years, since I was 16 years old. During that time I have owned a couple of guns (all you anti gun folks would probably have apoplexy if you knew how many and I'm a piker as I know people who own 300 and 500 guns). So, would you say my friends and have too many guns? And if so, on what do you base that determination? Further, what gives you the right? I am a former peace officer. I have never used a gun illegally. At the risk of sounding immodest, my expertise with firearms is above that of the average police officer (but less compared to other folks I know). I once knew a federal cop who competed in local shooting matches because the firearms training he received was inadequate. He knew that the rest of the people participating in these matches had training and experience that far surpassed his training. As a private person I have used a firearm to prevent assaults on my person on two occasions and as an off-duty police officer I have stopped one potential assault against me and my companion and I stopped an assault in progress of a neighbor and his friend. Actually, two men were in the process of beating them to death with a gold club and baseball bat. Those two people were defenseless and would have been killed had I not intervened, with a handgun. And guess what, it was not necessary to shoot any of the assailants. All of the assailants saw the wisdom of reconsidering their actions, immediately and without question. I currently have a permit to carry a firearm concealed and I never leave home without my permit and gun. I could continue like this for some time.

If by protecting myself I am protecting other people around me then that is a byproduct.

If you were a friend of mine and decided to carry a concealed handgun but still had those reservations I would tell you not to carry you obviously don't have the right mentality to carry yet. To carry you have to accept the fact that you may actually have to use your gun, carrying a handgun when youÕre not ready to use it is more dangerous than not carrying. If you aren't ready to pull the trigger you shouldnÕt be carrying. I will agree that flight beats fight if it is possible, what I am worried about is the times when you canÕt run.

I have never been part of a school shooting but I know it is a possible. Actually I am not worried about a major school shooting happening at my campus what scares me is all the other violent crime that is much more prevalent. Including robbery, battery, assault, these crimes even at my campus which is way out in the middle of the country are prevalent. The biggest one around here is forcible rape, it happens here a lot and I know many female friends that would carry if they had the choice to protect themselves from these crimes.

Also show me where this has happened off campus, I tried looking and I didn't find any instances of a permit holder missing and hitting an innocent person. I am not saying it doesn't happen I know it does but statistically you are more likely to get hit from a cops missed shot than a permit holders.

2684	guns	"This is where the discussion is lost on all too many who view the world in somewhat unrealistically rosy glasses.  Backing up a bit now.  Throughout history, the strong and advantaged have often taken from others (eg. weak and disandvantaged) via coersion.  Barbaric.  ""Civilization"", however, made life better for most everyone but the barbarians.  While civilizations are characterized by division of labor, etc., they are also predicated upon sharing and upon agreements by those members of society ... agreements on what is right and wrong, acceptable and unacceptable, and on what is lawful and unlawful.  Civilizations work because ""good"" people contribute and are rewarded (generally) for doing so.  But there remain those ""bad"" people who still take advantage (when they are allowed to) via coersion.  It is this reality, in part, on which the guarantee to arms was predicated.  Arms were guaranteed so good people (civilized people) could protect themselves from bad people.  Not only ""could"" protect themselves, but WOULD protect themselves (thus reducing the bad people in society).  We all work to educate and train our fellow citizens, and to reward good behavior with gifts, honor, or a simple pat on the back.  We also work together (and establish criminal justice and rule of law) to punish bad people.  We pretty much all agree that murder and rape and robbery are bad and cannot be tolerated.  What the right to arms guarantees is that we as individuals, as first responders, have the power (we have the natural right, as well as the legal authority) to defend ourselves, families, and community via force of arms (it would be swords or clubs if firearms did not exist).  Security of a free state plays full into this, because the natural right to self defense cannot be decoupled from the right (and the necessity) to community and even national defense.  A well-regulated militia is a group of armed citizens (individuals) coming together in a time of need ... to dispell unlawful insurrections, to prevent looting after a natural disaster, or to repel an invading military force.  That militia is in agreement as to their purpose ... and that purpose is a good one because it maintains law and order, and promotes the safety and security of communities, states, and nations.And finally, from a statement you made above to Nitrogen: ""To me, guns rights represent the freedom to threaten terrible violence.""  I think that view is a rather common one, but I also think it is predicated on a misunderstanding of what freedom is, what rule of law is, and what gun rights are.  It is argued that humans (and all other living things) have a natural right to self defense via force.  But few would argue that we have any sort of right to offense.  The second amendment in no way whatsoever authorizes or gives any right to offense or to ""threaten terrible violence"" as you put it (by ""threaten"" I presume you mean ""offensive violence"").  The second amendment protects the right to own and carry arms (knives, saps, guns, whatever) for the purpose of lawful use of force ... be that to stop a common criminal in your home, a group of terrorist/insurrectionists such as the KKK of days gone by or the Timothy McVeighs of modern history, be that keeping the peace when our professional police force cannot, or be that repeling an invading force.

I know their capabilities, and what they can do, but despite everything else, I do agree when it is stated that accidental shooting are rare, and the ability to carry a concealed weapon will most definately be a benefit to students on campus.  In my state, it is a proven statistic that hunting, above all other forms of recreation, have the lowest rate of personal injury, virutally zero.  Hunting is the safest sport of all, oddly enough.  When good citizens that know the parameters of what can happen with a firearm, are able to carry, then they have now become able to protect themselves and others.  God forbid if I was ever faced with a situation such as an intruder in school, I would know that I could defend myself and others.  I do understand Nada's argument of how people who may carry concealed weapons do not have proper expereince with firearms, but with yourself, being a ""concealed-carrier"", did you have to complete a firearm safety course before being given your permit?  If we think about it, whether you are in an area that allows concealed carrying or not, if things move as to the extreme of guns being banned, all of the law abiding citizens would not be protected, and no matter what the laws were, all the ""bad guys"" with bad intentions would have thier way no matter what..and this is why it is all the more reasonable that students should be allowed to carry concealed weapons on campus."

The 2nd amendment states that all citizens have the right to bear arms and that this right shall never be infringed.  The fact that this debate is astonishing to me.Take the peaceful country of Switzerland for example; they boast one of the lowest crime rates in the world (if not the lowest) due to the fact that everyone is armed.  After serving a short term in the army (which I'm not recommending for the US), every man is given a weapon of their choice.  So it's kind of hard to rob a convenience store when the clerk has an AK-47 or a M-16 behind the counter, maybe even a rocket launcher if they want.Guns keep people safe, it's plain and simple.  Like the Swiss have found, it's hard to overpower someone when they're packing a .45 on their hip or purse.

Which situation seems more likely - the war zone or the false perception?The assumption that gun possession keeps you safer is just false. The gun you own is more likely to be used to kill you, your spouse or an innocent person than to kill an attacker. The perception that armed attackers lurk around every dark corner is also false.

Paul Helmke says, ""Guns are always going to be available to law-abiding citizens.  But we can take steps to make it harder for dangerous people to get dangerous weapons.""  Unfortunately Mr. Helmke is not being completely honest here.  What he leaves out is that SOME guns will always be available to law-abiding citizens (unless we at the Brady Campaign have our way).

Please take a look at the laws on the books, all 20,000 or more and tell me if there is anything that should be illegal for someone to do with a gun that is not already illegal.  Once you have done that, ask yourself, ""Why doesn't the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence focus on preventing gun violence?""  They could easily do this by lobbying for harsher punishment of people who buy guns for someone who is not legally allowed to (commonly called straw purchasers), and by arresting people for attempting to buy guns when they are ineligible and they know it (like a felon trying to buy a gun to commit yet another crime). If they focused on these things along with educated children on what to do when they find a gun, they might actually accomplish their stated purpose... reducing gun violence.  They won't do those things because they WANT gun violence to be high so that they can continue to push banning guns and further restricting guns so that fewer and fewer people own them.  The Brady Campaign has no shame in its push to ban so-called ""Assault Weapons"" which are really just semi-automatic guns, no different, and in fact less powerful than 90% of hunting rifles, because they claim that these rifles are only used for mass killings and assaults.  The problem with that logic is that less than 1% of all gun related crime is committed with these so-called ""assault weapons"".

But the fact remains that over 4,000 people successfully defend themselves every day in this country with   firearms  . For every   homicide  ,   suicide  , and accidental   shooting  , 10 lives are saved through defensive use of firearms. To answer the question posed by this article, ""Do guns make you safer?"" ask yourself the following questions:¥ If guns are effective enough to be a criminal's preferred tool, why are they not good enough to use for protection?¥ Why do politicians insist their bodyguards be armed, but not you and I?¥ If you and your   children   were face-to-face with a male attacker twice your size, what would you do; If you weren't armed? If you were armed?¥ If guns are ""too dangerous"" to be in our   society  , then why do our leaders want to be the only ones who have them? Do you trust our leaders implicitly to protect you at all times?¥ Which is better Ð more   gun control   and the eventual banning of all guns in our society, or not sitting by helplessly watching as an intruder repeatedly rapes your 13-year-old daughter?¥ If we ever completely ban guns, do you think there would be no more armed criminals in America?¥ With so many   gun laws   already on the books, why do ""gun crimes"" still exist?    /gun-facts-5.1-screen.pdfSeriously. Take a minute to really ponder those questions. If you do, and you go out and talk to people who own guns and have used them in defense of their lives you will come to a couple of realizations. First, guns save lives. There are too many examples of people using them to protect themselves to argue with that. Second, the vast majority of gun owners are nothing like the picture painted by the   media  . I am an active pro-gun supporter and have daily dealings with others who share a like mind. And I can tell you that they are very aware of and concerned with obeying   the law  , especially when it comes to the carry and use of their guns. Most of us know our gun laws better than the average citizen. We have to because even in states that are generally pro-gun (like Tennessee, where I live) there is a patchwork of different gun regulations and restrictions. For example, it will be   legal   as of Sept. 1 of this year to carry in our state parks, but many municipalities will be ""opting out"" of this   law  , banning guns in their parks. So we always have to be aware of when and where we can and can't carry. And almost all of us obey those laws to the letter. Some by locking their guns in their   cars   before entering parks and restaurants that do not allow carry, and others by just not going there in the first place. There are plenty of other places that are glad to take our   money  .Finally, for the record ""a lot"" does not constitute a statistic. "	FAVOR

Not the legally armed citizens of our country. Wake up people. You're not going to keep   guns   out of the hands of criminals by taking them out of mine. Just like you haven't kept drugs off the streets of America. Narcotics are absolutely illegal to use without a doctor's prescription, everywhere, all the time. And what effect have laws against them had? None. So what makes you think that guns will be any different? The answer: ignorance. Actually, I don't even believe that is true. Deep down you know it's true, but you refuse to acknowledge it. Well, it's time to do so America.

When they are old enough to understand, each of the children will have guns explained to them, their capabilities and safe handling. I think you need to demystify guns to prevent youth endangerment. these few ""accidental"" deaths of children (pools kill more kids by the way, I think thats on the CDC website) I believe occur because no one took the time to sit little johnny or susie down and say this is mommy or daddy's gun. this is how it works and this is why you shouldn't touch it. if you want to see it, ask mom or dad, and we'll make it safe for you to understand.the ballistics primer- those aren't watered down for civilians, thats really the capability of the platform. You take an AR-15 from me, from your local military base, or your local PD and thats what it'll do.as for your capacity restriction question- again more random facts, most states do have capacity restrictions for game hunting, and for a rifle it is usually 5 rounds. I'm not preaching, just making you aware of it.why should civilians have the right to higher capacity magazines? I apologize, but I'm not sure where to find the #s of shootings where x number of rounds is fired in a concise package. My guess is the FBI has it somewhere, but who knows how long that will take to tease out. Anyway- what I'm going for is there are many many violent assaults each year where multiple criminals attack, beat, rape, and kill. Even if your local PD has a fantastic response time of 2 minutes- 2 minutes is a long time to keep many individuals at bay while you retreat and try to get you and yours to safety.finally a note on 50 caliber rifles- They've never been used in a crime. The caliber has been around for nearly a 100 or so years give or take. It doesn't get used in crimes. rifles in that caliber start around 2000 dollars. ammunition is several dollars per round. Its not going to be picked up on the black market as a hot item to commit crimes with. It's just not. also you wanna ban 50 cal weapons? by doing so you ban many blackpowder/musket style rifles, which are extremely popular for traditional hunters and marksmen. if you ban 50+ cal weapons, you pretty much make every gun in the revolutionary war illegal. Also- 12 gauge shotguns, with a nominal bore diameter of nearly .7 inches, would also become illegal.basically your spelling death to much of the current level of north American hunting. Not sure if thats what you want, but thats what it would be. You'd be outlawing so much, to prevent something that has never been misused, from continuing to not be misused.I'm sorry for all the car analogies, but I feel like its an easy to understand parallel. Thats like banning cars because some cars go over 200 mph. Sure no one goes over 200 mph on your street, but in theory, with enough money, someone could- so lets just get rid of all automobiles and go to mopeds."	FAVOR

There is also pretty solid evidence that less restrictions for   law  -abiding citizens have a positive effect. ---For example, Washington D.C. implemented their gun ban in 1976, and between 1976 and 1991, the   homicide   rate there rose 200% while the rest of the country saw only a 12% increase. ---In ""More Guns, Less Crime"" John Lott showed that concealed carry laws accounted for 8.5% decrease in the   murder   rate, a 5% decrease in rape, and 7% decrease in assaults.-I really don't see why   gun rights   represent the freedom to threaten terrible violence. Remember that when we talk about gun rights we are only speaking of those who should have   guns   in the first place. No organization, pro or anti-gun, advocates more guns in the hands of criminals. That's just ludicrous. It's illegal now, and it will continue to be illegal. ---In addition, if you take a look at statistics, you will find that carry permit holders in the U.S. are among the most law-abiding citizens in the U.S. Very, very rarely do the ""display"" their guns when in public. The majority of permit holders carry concealed for myriad reasons. Among them is respect for those that are less familiar or scared of guns, to avoid any type of elevated tensions.---Gun ownership may not help your sense of security, but to be blunt, that's just tough. I'm not asking you to carry a gun, or to even own one and keep it locked in a safe. And the truth of the matter is, if you don't live in one of the two states that completely prohibit you from carrying a gun, you have unknowingly stood in line behind a person carrying a gun. You have sat across from them at a restaurant. You have bumped into them walking down the street. Is it your experience that gun owners just take their guns out and wave them around for everyone to see? Of course not. That's because we take the responsibility of gun ownership very seriously. We, as a whole, are more versed in   gun laws   than the general population because we have to be constantly aware of where and when we can and cannot carry. We, as a whole, are better trained and more practiced than many (not all, of course) law enforcement agents. And there are PLENTY of quotes from the Brady Campaign that show that they seek to ban all   firearms   eventually, in a phased approach.-What about ideologically-driven insiders? As of now, the   supreme court   has ruled that I have a right to carry a firearm, as long as I am not a convicted criminal, etc. But the state of Illinois says I don't have that right.

Using your figure of 5.6 per 100k and assuming that firearm ownership triples the rate, then the rate in homes NOT owning a firearm would be 1/3 of  5.6, which is 1.86 (repeating).But even so, it doesn't work that way, because the figure of 5.6 per 100k is a mathematical average based on national data. It does not reflect the situation in any given household. Its like saying that 45% of Americans own a dog. That does not mean that 45% of every household has a dog (or that every household has 45% of a dog!). To generate meaningful data, you would have to do a study of the homicide rate in households with and without a gun, in a sample population.

In the construction of these game laws it seems to be held, that no person who is not qualified according to law to kill game, hath any right to keep a gun in his house. Now, as no person, (except the game-keeper of a lord or lady of a manor) is admitted to be qualified to kill game, unless he has 100l. per annum, &amp;c. it follows that no others can keep a gun for their defence; so that the whole nation are completely disarmed, and left at the mercy of the government, under the pretext of preserving the breed of hares and partridges, for the exclusive use of the independent country gentlemen.

The simple fact is that access to firearms makes it much easier for people to kill one another. In many cases, the presence of a firearm escalates a situation from an otherwise non-fatal incident into a homicide. So while it is technically true that firearms do not kill people in-and-of themselves, they make it much easier for people to kill each other. However, this is not to say that firearms cannot have a role in preventing violence, but rather that the relationship between firearms and the occurrence of violence is more complex than it appears."

Was it interference of ideologically-driven outsiders when civil rights organizers came from halfway across the country to try to end racial segregation?  Does the city get to forbid a Muslim Mosque?  There is a pretty clear divide between lawful gun owners and criminals.  The ones that will be stopped by a law aren't the ones you need worry about--they will obey the existing laws against murder and assault.   The ones who will murder and assault aren't going to obey gun laws, either.  I keep seeing statements that the Brady Campaign and their associates won't violate the fundamental right to bear arms, but I have never seen a statement of what guns we would have left, if the Brady Campaign were completely successful.    I suspect .22 bolt-action rifles, .410 shotguns and not much else. All of the following have been proposed as ""reasonable restrictions"":The assault weapons ban covered guns that held too much ammo, or looked scary. It covered handguns that were too large and heavy.  It regulated bayonet mounts and the way the wood was carved.   It forbid handguns that were too large, or that held their magazines in front of the grip, or that were called ""Uzi"".   The Gun Control Act of 1967 covered imported Saturday Night Specials that working class people could afford.   Several localities have extended that restriction to domestically produced guns with the same features and design.  Guns .50 caliber and larger are ""too powerful"" and ""used to bring down airplanes"". A ban on ""cop killer"" bullets capable of penetrating police body armor.  Many people not familiar with the details would think that these are all reasonable restrictions.  However: The Glock models 17 and 22 are the standard full-sized handgun that many police departments issue. They are large enough that many departments issue the slightly smaller models 19 and 23 instead.  All of these guns, as carried by tens of thousands of policemen were covered by the now expired assault weapons ban--""too big"" for civilians to carry unless you used special reduced capacity magazines.  Oddly, they are also covered by the 1967 law--Glock has to put click-adjustable sights on them to get enough ""points"" so they are not classified as a ""Saturday Night Special"" or ""Junk Gun"".   The click sighs are generally replaced by the original versions by the importer before sale.  If these guns are simultaneously too big and too small, what is left in between? The ""cop killer"" rules would ban ALL common rifle ammunition except .22 rimfire.  The standard body armor as worn by police is only meant to protect against handguns--in order to protect against rifle with current technology, the armor would need to be far bulkier than it is.   Some of the laws that are promoted as banning the .50BMG also cover revolutionary war flintlock muskets, and all common shotguns except the .410.  There is usually an exception for shotguns ""particularly suitable for sporting purposes"" as decided by some bureaucrat-- But we promise this won't be used to take *your* shotgun, honest. . Hollow point ammo is ""so deadly it is forbidden to be used in warfare"", and therefore not suitable.  Jacketed ammo is ""too military"".  To me, gun rights represent freedom and self-reliance rather than subservience.  They do not represent the right to use my gun to get my way--If I use a gun or the threat of one to win an argument, I should be prosecuted and go to jail.  I already have the power to take life.  The gun gives me the power to protect life and liberty.  "	FAVOR
2758	guns	"The statistical facts you talk about have severe flaws when trying to use them to justify more laws.  First is counting suicide as ""gun violence"", assuming that all those who choose a gun would not find another method if guns are not available.  (Japan...) Even if that were true, an increased risk of suicide may be a reason to try to convince people to voluntarily give up guns.  It is not sufficient justification to eliminate freedom and choice.  Second is the definition of ""used in self defense"".  Over 90% of the time when a law-abiding person defends with a gun, no shots are necessary.  These studies insist that the defender must shoot or kill someone before it counts as ""used in self defense"".  My definition of defense is quite different--If someone runs away I will let them, and consider that the best possible outcome to a bad situation.  Finally, households with convicted criminals have many times higher rates of gun violence-Not even in the same league as the law abiding.  Eliminate these people from your sample and the ""violence"" rates plummet. It isn't the guns causing the danger, it is the criminal behavior, including illegally possessing guns.  Adding laws that restrict the behavior of the law-abiding in order to stop criminals who are already ignoring existing laws isn't logical.  Ally in the sense of having goals in common, and rarely conflicting.  Not as in ""members of the same team, working together to capture criminals"".  As far as safer?   Without legal firearms criminals have a much clearer idea of who makes a good victim-Pick a small weak looking person walking alone, and a knife, or even a couple of similarly inclined associates are plenty.  Lawful guns create a shield effect, even to those not using them.  Spree shootings aren't CAUSED by ""no gun"" zones, they are caused by spree shooters.  Spree shootings have fewer victims when there is someone on the scene who can shoot back-In more than one case, to the point of not being large-scale despite evidence that was the intent.  In most cases, that means a license holder.  Spree shooters realize this, and if they have a choice of venue, they are likely to pick the one where guns are forbidden. ""Arm everyone"" is not what is proposed.  When states adopt objective licensing criteria, licenses seem to stabilize at roughly 2% of the population, roughly 10 years later.  All available data says that this 2% is many times more law abiding and less violent than the general population.  The idea that ""most people"" would rather have ""everyone disarmed"" flies in the face of gun ownership rates--Somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 of American households own guns, and many who don't own guns still think that it should be allowed. What ""most people"" would like to see is enforcement of existing laws.  When someone fails a gun purchase background check, there is an arrest about 1% of the time--There should be a police investigation 100% of the time, and a whole lot more arrests.  "	FAVOR

Osama Bin Laden, believes that his actions against the U.S.A. and any supporter of our country, as  well as the majority of the countries who do not follow his beliefs, are evil. These are moralstandpoints, and really cannot be argued to totality except through escalation of force.Having stated such, I currently serve in the U.S. Army, as a soldier, I am required, and proud tobe able to defend my country, and the rights they believe in. Now, defending a person(s) orcountries ""rights"" is not just a defensive measure. In times of need, when required OFFENSIVEstrategies are required to ensure that a person(s) or entities ""rights"" are thereby preserved throughthe course of time. If we would have known beyond a reasonable doubt, that 9/11 was going tohappen, and stopped the course of events before the 9/11 tragedy occurred, would any of yousit back a say ""Well they didn't pull it off, let's let bygones be bygones.""? no, we would not.We would as we are today, be afraid that something like this would happen, might happen, and something worse would happen. We would be obligated to go on the offensive and our actionsare justified by the reasoning that a person intends us harm.Just by being a soldier, I am doing something that less that 1% of the total of the U.S. populationcannot, or will not do. However, against all odds, I hope and pray, that when the day comes, thata foreign entity decides that they have the audacity to invade the U.S.A., that I will have my fellowcountrymen take up whatever arms they can acquire, be it fully automatic rifles, pistols, grenades,dynamite, nitroglycerin, or C4 explosive, and help me and my comrades defend what we believeis right and just. Saying that this will never happen is like saying that 9/11 will never happen. Well,it happened, and the only thing one needs to do is take an interest in history to notice that theonly thing another country needs to invade another country is greed, envy of what another countryhas, that they want for themselves.My father was military for the majority of my adolescence. He taught me a respect for guns, andweapons of all nature. I've had, or used a weapon of some type since I was 5 years old. I am now32 years old. What would I do, if our country decided that a person did not have the ""right"" tokeep and bear arms? I know what I would do, I would hide my weapons against any search andseizure, and continue to keep them for purposes of protection, be it defensive or offensiveprotection. I will not ever, capitulate to any aggressive entity that will threaten the lives of my family,or myself, not the property that we have worked hard for."	FAVOR

Firearms are as safe as cars, power saws, electricity and many other things in every day life.I read a story about people that were afraid to go to a National Park because they would run into people carry firearms. And the problem is what? 48 states have concealed carry laws. You have been around prople carrying firearms and didn't know it. There are millions of us.We look just like everyone else.

Lets start at the root of the problem, we are raising our   children   to be criminals. Criminals that steal, rob and rape and   murder  . If these people were raised to value human life, who were raised to KNOW the difference between right and wrong, to stay away from those who do not, and raised their voices when they saw the law being broken, then we would not have the need to carry guns. Its not the guns that should be regulated its the parenting skills of people who do not get involved in their children's lives. These   kids   run the streets  following the gangs, listening to music that glorifies the types of behaviors that we as a   society   abhor.

2778	guns	Sorry but after reading many of the pathetic comments in response this topic, I have to wonder about the intellectual capacity of the people making the comments. First off it has been proven on many occasions that guns are not the problem and that more guns in the hands of Law Abiding citizens actually deters crime. You don't have to take my word for it, do your due diligence and go no further than the FBI crime statistics and right to carry states.Your fear of guns stems from a complete ignorance of facts which is readily displayed in many of the postings here. It would behoove you to actually do some research on the subject at hand before your write something that will be published for public scrutiny. And keep in mind when you go to battle based on emotional hearsay with no facts, you generally lose.Fact 1. Your math is incorrect. Again I refer to actual crime statistics and right to carry comparisons. Every state, county, city that has restrictive gun control has a higher violent crime rate than those that exercise right to carry. And again that is based on facts in evidence from the FBI, not some emotional knee jerk reaction... as 99% of the anti-gun rhetoric is wont to be.Fact 2. Gun control does not solve the problem, education does. Watch these three clips and begin to understand your stance is one of ignorant emotional fear.-      - John Stossel 20/20-      - Canada's failed gun control-      - England's failed gun control-      - The woman is on the phone with the POLICE! When she has to use her recently acquired hand gun to save her life. Proof that when you have a choice between 911 and 1911... 1911 is a sure fire way to stay alive.Fact 3. Over 2,000,000 crimes are deterred annually by legally armed citizens. Again these facts can be verified by FBI crime data.I am not going to provide you with the links to the FBI crime data because you can easily find it yourself. That is if your are truly an open minded individual that is ready to accept that maybe your stance is not only based on lies but untenable at best.Thing is I can pretty much with a 99% certainty guarantee you won't even watch any of the videos provided either Mainly because most Liberals I have run into cannot and will not deal with facts. They would rather deal in emotion and use yelling and name calling to attempt to derail a debate or argument that is going against them. Saw that when Ron Paul was kicking arse in the debates, and again with Obama and McCain. Anyhow you will continue to cower in fear due to your ignorance, which you could easily remedy by doing some solid fact searching, while good honest law abiding citizens are out there protecting you by exercising their right to carry.The bottom line is you and your agenda are not the solution, you are part of the problem. But you are incapable of admitting or seeing that since you use emotion instead of logic, reason and intelligence guide your through life. Too bad too, you are in a position to actually provide a solution through education, but you chose instead to use fear. Just like the last administration did and the current one will continue to do.Sincerely a law abiding gun owner and a veteran.	FAVOR

This created the National Guard as it exists  today, elevating this militia to a fully state-run and regulated militia. At this point, the idea of an independent, citizen-run militia was effectively ended, and replaced by a more advanced, capable, and useful militia. With this state-run militia becoming the only legitimate militia, it became impossible that citizens would have an individual right to bear arms in order to form an independent militia.

I think a system like they have in the UK which involves high fees, tight design restrictions and a well-funded, stringent licensing system would accomplish the goal of keeping most hunting weapons legal.My bottom-line argument is that handguns and military-style rifles (aka assault weapons - a label which I think you'll find most gun manufacturers love as it boosts their product image among the target buyers) are too easy to get and the minority of the population that can't be trusted to act rationally and in society's best interest shouldn't have as easy access to them as they do now. Enforcing a strict and expensive licensing system should reduce the incidents of theft as owners will be incented to take better care of their weapons, and the less responsible owners will be ""self selected"" out of ownership as they will likely choose to not bother with a time-consuming, expensive process that will fine or jail them if they violate it.Making these kinds of weapons illegal would certainly force people that want to get them to pursue illegal means. As they do in the UK and other countries. The results though are that a black market has not emerged at the scale predicted by the gun supporters. Gun violence and gun-related homicide happen at a fraction of the rate predicted. This is true across multiple countries.My final argument is this - no matter the level of passion expressed by the minority of the population that wants to keep this policy as is, the fact that the majority of the population wants to change it should prevail when it comes to legislation. The 2nd Amendment is no more sacred than any other Amendment which has been interpreted, reintrepeted and limited by modern lawmakers. I note that most gun right activists have stopped arguing we need to maintain a well regulated militia, as described in the preamble of this amendment. Anachronisms like that are a sign of why we can't let arguments like ""the founding fathers intended it to be this way"" hold sway over the current opinion and measured results of policy today.It's a passionate issue - one that gets voters out and voting, manufacturers vast profits and gets the NRA and other lobbying groups enormous sums of money. The political nature of this issue means that rational debate and argument are hard to conduct without extremists from both ends weighing in and making it highly emotional.My final thought - I think - is that personally I like guns. I enjoy the design and manufacturing quality that goes into a well made gun. The precision required to turn the relatively light pressure of pulling a trigger on a semi-automatic weapon into an extremely powerful firing pin, case ejection, round loading and re-cocking of the hammer action is impressive to me. And it does feel good to shoot them. But I don''t let that outweigh the risks posed to everyone when that kind of power is granted to people who just can't use it correctly. It's too dangerous and not worth the risk. That's a calculation that most people have made. I wish people were more responsible, but they aren't."	AGAINST

He called her phone, two of my aunts' phones, and her mother's phone. This not only stressed her out, it caused her   children   to be visibly depressed, leaving them in tears, and caused her mother, to become near hysterical. So are you really going to insist that drug use is a victimless crime? I don't think you'd find very many reputable sources that would say that.""Heroin used to be sold over the counter, some estimates place functional addiction in America almost to the one third mark at it's peak. Society's chief problem at the time? The stock market."" What time was this, and what evidence supports it? I mean, one third seems like an awfully high number. Alcohol is perfectly   legal   now, and so are   cigarettes  . But combined the percent of people addicted to these two substances doesn't equal 1/3. I couldn't find   alcohol   addiction alone, but best estimates for cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol combined is about 73 million people in the U.S., or about 20%. And ""  society  's chief problem"" is a subjective statement, and therefore pretty difficult to quantify.""The number of homeless people who are mentally ill is staggering.""Again, a subjective statement, but only about 1% of Americans are homeless for an extended period of time, with about 40-45% of those being considered mentally ill. While that number is sad, I'd be hard pressed to call it staggering. ""This image of the nanny state is largely a myth perpetrated by the right in order to preserve their own ill gotten gains.""Again, can you quantify this statement? And I'm a conservative. How exactly are my gains ""ill gotten."" I have worked my tail off just to reach middle class, and I have done it without infringing on the rights or walking on anyone to get where I am. And I have lived well below the poverty line, and it was nobody's fault but mine. And don't forget that there are plenty of people on the left who are obscenely wealthy. Are their gains ill gotten? That statement reeks of elitism and is a disgusting generalization, in my opinion.""The typical upper class American could not survive without the state regulating their business competition out of existence, and subsidizing their failures. (AIG anyone?)""While I am certainly not a part of the group to which you point in this statement, I think you are vilifying unjustly an entire group of people. If you had used a racial segment of the population, this would be called   racism  . Depending on what you call ""upper class"" I don't think that statement would hold water either. And I won't even begin to debate what the cause of the financial market collapse was, so don't waste your time trying to bait me into that one. ;-)Oh, and I forgot this one: ""Opening the door to a whole class of workers who spend their   money   on heroin instead of WoW and still show up to work on time.""Seriously? Really? You honestly think that a heroin addict would show up to work on time? Really? I mean that statement damn near leaves me speechless. If anything I said was questionable, that statement is outright pot-of-gold-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow fantasy. I seriously hope you didn't type that with a straight face. Again, I'm still on the fence, and that was   food   for thought, but much of what you said is subjective at best, and pure opinion at worst. Like I said before, if you want to destroy your life, go right ahead. Just don't drag me, or any other innocent person down with you. "	FAVOR

2811	guns	"How many school shootings are ""acceptable""? I think the NRA's answer diverges wildly from the majority of the population. Kids aren't made safer at school with guns easily available to their classmates or the people that decide to wander in.The issues are1) possession of guns are totally in our legislature's control2) the majority of people would prefer that guns not be easy to possess, but because they don't pay lobbyists at the rate the gun manufacturers and owners do, legislatures ignore them over those that do contribute.3) disturbed kids and adults have proven, repeatedly, that they can use the current system to easily possess as many guns as they need to cause mass death and injury.The NRA's solution of a) reminding people they should be more responsibleb) asking the government to ensure no mentally disturbed person possesses a gun (but not by any restriction on the 2nd amendment, mind you)c) encourage the use of a background check system which they fought tooth and nail against when it was proposed and when it needs funding is a good summary of why the NRA is so reviled. None of these solutions have a realistic chance of fixing the problem. All of these points seem defensible, at first glance, and give them good cover when nobody bother reading past the headline (and most don't). But when you take a close look at what they're doing, they are simply throwing out deceptive, distracting arguments to keep guns on the streets and allow gun violence to continue unchecked.They have the gall to stand up after public shootings to say this never would have happened if the victims had been armed. As if we all desire a wild west shoot out as the best way to prevent gun violence. Or insult our intelligence by assuming we accept the idea that the average gun owner is qualified to start shooting in a public place at anyone they perceive to be a threat. Our kids have to go through metal detectors at schools, have their bags and lockers searched and other forms of security as a response to the ""need"" to keep guns on the streets. Ridiculous.

2819	guns	Thanks for your reply, SidAirfoil. Having considered your answers, I had a couple of ideas come to mind for your consideration.You said that American's distrust stemmed from a 'careful' reading of history, but I wondered if 'particular' would be a more accurate word, because it seems (to me) that the American attitude to government comes with a set of implicit assumptions attached that may serve to hinder neutral analysis. Specifically, it seem to me that there is an anarchistic assumption at work that attaches a negative value to all forms of government (ie. all governments are bad/government is a necessary evil) and rankles at the imposition of rules on the individual by the state. If you begin with this sort of assumption, it is hardly surprising that American's are distrustful of their government.  My theory (and feel free to disagree) is that a good deal of this distrust stems from the American cultural narrative of the 'rebellious colony that fought for freedom from tyranny', and which views any form of government with great suspicion irrespective of whether that government is malignant or benign. I guess what I am saying is that it seems that the notion of 'government as the enemy' was relevant at the time of the American revolution and the drafting of the US Constitution, but that the distrust of government that was relevant then has become part of the American cultural narrative. It has subsequently been transfered down through generations to the point where it has become an almost irrefutable 'truth' asserted with almost religious conviction, long past the point where the situations that precipitated its invention have ceased to apply.Regarding the value of constitutional republics and their ability to prevent tyranny, I think it is worth considering the effect that time has on entrenching institutional norms and preventing divergence from those norms. To put it more succinctly, the system dictates the behaviour of those acting within the system to a significant degree. In the context of government, each person knows (more or less) what their role is, what the limits of their power are, and that someone is (presumably) watching what they are doing and will intervene if they step out of line. Occassionally, some try to outwit the system, but most of them fail. In the cases where they succeed, it has more to do with the size and awkwardness of the bureaucracy than actual institutional weakness. What I mean here is that it does not automatically follow that the unstable political   conditions   that precipitated the American revolution are still relevant in the present day, where the institutions and practices of democratic government are deeply entrenched. I take your point about the price of a free   society  , but I suspect that your definition of 'free' might differ significantly from mine. Personally, I see the freedom from the danger of random gunfire to be a more immediately useful freedom than the right to have a gun to fight against hypothetical political oppression. The point I am trying to tease out here is that maybe the concerns that provide the basis for the Second Amendment are no longer (as) applicable, and that you are arming yourselves against (and paying the price for) a threat that is largely illusory. Ultimately of course, its a matter that Americans must decide for themselves, but as an observer I can't help but think that the price you pay as a society for your particular brand of freedom seems awfully steep.Finally, one more question if you don't mind. Having considered your comments about freedom and the extent to which government intervention into the affairs of the individual can be tolerated, how do Americans understand their relationship to the social contract? I ask this because Americans seem to tolerate far less 'government interference' in their lives than people in other societies, so I wonder how American's reconcile their individualism with the practical need for social cohesion.

What also needs to be considered, is that those who are of legal age to carry a gun, are protect by the second amendment. So why should our personal liberties be thrown away?	FAVOR
2851	guns	        This summary of surveys backs up part of your argument and part of mine:        I can no longer say most people want everyone but the police disarmed. That's not true according to these polls. But they do want gun laws to be stricter.I'd argue that making guns easily available but trying to legislate their purchase and ownership through poorly funded systems of gun laws is a recipe for disaster. I think the theory is good - and if police and the FBI had enough money to chase every failed background check, and every state spent enough money to keep the background check system accurate, it could work out. But like most good ideas there's not enough money to make it work in the real world. So I'd argue you have to eliminate the supply to effect the restrictions the law is attempting to achieve.I won't argue that permit-carrying licensed gun owners aren't more law-abiding than the rest of the population. My point is that those that want to cause harm can get access to weapons too easily. I don't think the concealed-carry permit holders are a good defense against them. So I'm in favor of making most guns illegal to sell or own, except for a restricted set of hunting rifles which requires a high fee to own and is strictly monitored by a well funded government system. I think that would make everyone safer.	AGAINST

I was educated in the public and private school system in the 1950s and 1960s. I was taught the Second Amendment was meant to overthrow tyrants, if it ever came to that. The petulant whining of Nancy Pelosi et al, only serves to display their true agenda. To rule. It's not about guns, it's about control.

(George Washington, speech of Jan. 7, 1790, in the Boston Independent Chronicle, Jan. 14, 1790)Samuel Adams wrote, ""The Constitution shall never be construed ... to prevent the people of the United States who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms."" (Samuel Adams, Debates and Proceedings in the Convention of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 86-87)Finally, Thomas Paine wrote, ""Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property ... Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them.""

2870	abortion	You are absolutely correct that making abortion illegal is not the only option. In fact, I would argue that it must not be. If we were simply to overturn Roe v. Wade and immediately pass a no exceptions federal ban on abortions now, the results would predictably look much like the days of Prohibition with disastrous results for countless women and babies.  However, though I freely admit this point, to use this as a means of justifying continued unrestricted legal abortion is a cop out.  As Catholics, our end goal should be no more abortions.  Since we agree that simply passing legislation is not enough, then we have our work cut out for us.  First, it is important for each of us to understand that this fight is not about women's rights as the pro choice advocates claim.  Rather it is about whether or not a human life, even an unborn one, is deserving of protection as a person under the law.  To deny one group or another personhood, as Roe v. Wade does the unborn child, means they can be disposed of with impunity for any reason and by any means whatsoever.  Allowing this to continue sets a dangerous precedent by which many people may be deemed nonpersons and disposed of.  It is a person's humanity, not his utility, that should guarantee rights and protection under the law.  These are the very principles our nation was founded on.  It can be found clearly stated in the opening paragraph of the Declaration of Independence.  This said, one must also be concerned for these mothers who find themselves in desperate situations which might drive them to choose abortion. Obviously, as a nation we have failed these women.  We have not provided them adequate support.  That must change.  If we are to turn the tide against abortion, these women need compassionate support, adequate health care, and options that enable them to continue their lives in dignity without putting their child to death. Many Democrats and Republicans, pro choice and pro life activists alike, have been working to engage in these kinds of services.  However, this alone is also not enough.  So long as we deny the unborn child personhood, the unmitigated slaughter will continue, and we as a nation are guilty of grave sin. These little lives deserve the same protection as the rest of us, and it is here in the fight against abortion that we have the opportunity to guarantee the protection of law to all human beings, be they big or small, healthy or disabled, young or old.  Anything less leaves us at the whim of judges, politicians, or the popular vote to decide who lives and who should die, a breeding ground for the likes of Hitler's Germany where large groups of people were targeted because of race, religion, genetic abnormality, and even such simple things as a less desirable hair and eye color. This cannot be allowed. We protect the lives of our pets, even stray animals, but offer nothing for our own children. Though other options can and even must be pursued, abortion must be made illegal, just as it is illegal to murder, to steal from others, or to beat and torture another because you disagree with his ideas. Directly causing his death is most certainly more a violation of the child's rights than carrying the baby to term could ever be for his mother. 	AGAINST

2872	abortion	"I now understand what exactly proponents of   abortion   mean when they put forward this idea of ""my body, my choice.""  It had never made sense to me before, probably because I was looking more at the fetus, and less at the womb.  Now that that clarification has been made, and the position has been truly explained well, I think it will be much easier to come to an understanding.  This is certainly the best argument for abortion that I have ever heard.  I think there is an issue separating abortion and refusing to give up a kidney, and that issue is that of activity vs. passivity.  A child in need of a kidney will die unless you give it to him.  Refusing to do so would cause the child to die, but it would not be actively killing him.  Doing nothing would cause the child to die, but action would save him.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, (as it should be) for the government to require a person to take action to save a life.  An abortion, on the other hand, is actively killing the child.  Doing nothing would allow the child to live.  Taking action to ensure that another human dies, whether they are dependent upon your body parts or not, is generally illegal.  Unfortunately, there aren't many good analogies for the unique relationship a fetus has with its mother.  A possibility could be siamese twins.  I'm not sure how well this analogy will work out, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that actively killing and removing your siamese twin because she relies on your heart and she inconveniences you would be more equivalent to abortion than denying a child your kidney.  Of course, this example doesn't take into account whether a fetus is a person, which brings us right back to where we started."	AGAINST

2874	abortion	"You analysis is exactly backwards.  Overturning MCP will only make a difference if money is given to people who will advise women to use   abortion   as a means of family planning and campaign for changes in foreign law which would make abortion easier to get.  This is a de facto subsidy for abortion which is a way for the government to undermine the pro-life position of much of the population.  The MCP precluded this.  In other words, money was still given to family planning efforts (as a form of humanitarian aid) provided that it not support abortion, but it was not used to support a pro-choice agenda.  You are falsely equating not supporting a pro-choice agenda with advocating for the pro-life position.If the MCP had been designed so that it promoted campaigns to criminalize abortion and to advise women that they must not have abortions (or that abortion was immoral) then your point of view would make sense- but most of the groups that received funds under MCP were groups which merely stopped those activities which had been disallowed by the policy.  In other words, the MCP did not say that funding was only supporting a pro-life agenda and pro-life groups.  It funded groups that ceased advocacy of the pro-choice agenda.  The idea that they then began advocating a pro-life agenda is just silly.At any rate, your suggestion that only pro-life agencies received funds is just false on the face of it.  My use of the slavery analogy is not 'bad'.  It is accurate.  You can say that you disagree with people who say that the positions are analogous, which I am sure is true.  The pro-choice makes almost the same comparison in reverse- by claiming that women are 'enslaved' when abortion is denied them.  My statement was that, ""For the pro-life side, legal abortion is an approximate moral equivalent of legal slavery.""

Then how can you physically remove the imaginary?Now, to the middle part; the issue is about the rights of two human beings: a mother and a child.  That's not even debatable since any doctor worth their degree must admit that the child is a living human being from the beginning.  It's high school biology.To the beginning, giving birth is not a sentence.  It is a consequence, but a deserved one (as all true consequences are).  And of course, being pro-life refers to the actual, real quality of life; not the whimsical, transitory one as in: 'get a life'; though we are pro-that as well.Now, where the birth of a child actually threatens the actual life of the mother, almost no one believes abortion shouldn't be considered.

2879	abortion	in my opinion it should be because if you don't want to get pregnant why are you having sexual activity	AGAINST
2880	abortion	Yeah, I know that the comparison tends to offend, but the fact is, there is very little difference between the two.  You claim that the difference is that women have sex by choice and become pregnant.  But people frequently acquire parasites through a voluntary act, too: Eating.  While certainly one can go far longer without sex than without eating, still both ARE voluntary actions which may result in a foreign living thing coming to attach itself to the inside of the hostÕs body and drawing its sustenance from the host without providing any particular symbiotic benefit to the host.  So, from a scientific perspective, there really is very little difference between the two.  Men (and sometimes women) tend to take very lightly the physical, psychological, and sometimes economic investment a woman makes during the 40 weeks of pregnancy.  Pregnancy is a body- and life-changing event which up until about ?-century ago, was the leading cause of mortality among women.  As it is, today, something like 4 in 1000 women will die, worldwide, as a result of pregnancy.  In developed nations, the lifetime risk of a woman dying as a result of one of her pregnancies is around 1 in 2800, but in places like sub-Saharan Africa, about 1 out of every 16 women will die as a result of one of her pregnancies over the course of her childbearing years.There are many women whose lives are at risk if they become pregnant.  There are some whose long-term health is at risk from pregnancy.  Some rely upon medications to control medical conditions, which medications may not be compatible with pregnancy.  Some women will lose their jobs if they become pregnant, particularly if they have bedrest.  Some women are caring for several infants and toddlers already, who rely on them, and cannot undergo the stress of another pregnancy, let alone care for their existing children during a difficult pregnancy.  Sometimes minors become pregnant before their bodies are strong and developed enough to support a pregnancy without risking severe damage.  Some women become pregnant as a result of rape, and have no choice in the matter at all.Just because a woman chooses (or is forced) to have sex does not mean that she is ipso facto giving consent to the complete takeover of her body by another being for the next 9 months of her life.  There are some very good reasons why women make the difficult choice to terminate a pregnancy.  I have made perfectly clear that I would be overjoyed if there were no further need for abortions in this world.  But there are some very valid reasons for a woman to have one.  And such decisions are best made by a woman and her doctor, rather than being forced upon her by society.  A rape victim, for instance, who is forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term is being raped yet again by society.  Her control of her body was taken from her by the rapist, and is again taken from her, at an even deeper and more violating level, by societyÕs compelling her to risk her very life and health to carry the pregnancy to term.

Biological death occurs when cells can no longer produce ATP. I've known a couple of women who had C-sections 3 and 4 months premature, and the baby managed to survive.

Laws should be based on ethics, not morality. However if mans nature is not fixed there can't be law or morality. Because there is no way man ought to be and no norm from which to deviate from.

If it is human than no justification is sufficient. About the choice, you made it when you decided to have sex.

If it's human, it's murder. hence the parallel.Fifth paragraph: The examples you give represent a very, very small percentage of abortions. The vast majority of abortions are preformed on healthy women and children. About adoption; me and my spouse are an infertile couple, we looked into adoption and guess what? there are long waiting list for domestic adoption simply because there are more couples than children due to the fact that over 1500 abortions are performed daily in this country. that's why most couples adopt from overseas.Sixth paragraph.

About the parallel with fire, in case you didn't know, passion burns. A fire not contained can destroy a whole forest. Don't believe me. Watch the interview Dr. Dobson did with Ted Bundy the night before his execution. I'll quote it for you from memory because it's burned in there:Dr Dobson: Ted, you once were an innocent little boy. How did you get here?Ted Bundy: Pornography. I was exposed to it as little boy and it became a passion that was never satisfied. The more I got the more wanted till I was killing women to get it. Just ask any man here who is here on sexual charges and he'll tell you the same thing.About the study; I don't dispute it. Of course it's failing that's my point. It's only logical that it would if you have a million people shouting, have sex and one small voice whispering, abstain. I doubt you did your homework and looked at the numbers for teen pregnancy and STDs before and after the sexual revolution.Abstinence is fail proof. You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant. However contraception is not so. You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant. It's that simple.Final thought; if morals are relative as you claim, why are you trying to push yours on me and why should I follow yours and not mine. Is it because you think there is an objective standard that people ought to follow and a way things ought to be. But that's just your personal preference isn't.

That's the ideal anything less than that is a degradation.On the beginning of life; According to the text book definition of life both the egg and sperm are alive. At the point of conception you have a complete DNA and a different one from both parents. That's an accepted scientific fact that is not in question. The question is what kind of life? cat, dog or a chicken? Nope, humans produce humans.About killing your neighbor; So long as he is not fully grown I can kill him? So, if it's the neighbors kid who I have been raising for the past nine months since his parents abandoned him; it's OK to kill him if I determine that I'm no longer stable enough to raise him? and even more so if I raised him for the last 18yrs? Yeah right. Try that in a court of law.Why do you think we should reduce the number of abortions? Is it because you know in your heart of heart that it takes the life of a human being in the early stages of development?We are drowning in a sea of condoms and sex ed and it has increased the rate of abortion, not decreased it.

2888	abortion	Apparently you are familiar with this ruling.  You say that during the first trimester   abortion   should be universally allowed, some restrictions in the second and even more in the third.  Well, this is exactly what Roe states.  Third trimester abortions are only allowed if the mother's life or health are in grave danger or if the fetus has such tremendous health problems it wouldn't live beyond birth but what few abortions are performed in the last trimester are usually to save the life of the woman.  So you see, compromise already exists.  Also, a fetus can not be a seperate entity until it is able to function outside of the womb.  This can't happen until about the 29th week.  Granted, there have been cases of 26-28 week deliveries but these usually result in very physically and mentally damaged children.  If a fetus delivers and doesn't take a spontaneous breath, the physicians usually won't try to resuscitate it because it means the respiratory system is too immature to function.  They don't want to put that child through any torture forcing it to try and live.  I've seen the miserable lives those children have gone through and was thankful when they finally died from all their medical complications.  Death is a normal part of life.  From the moment we are concieved we are on the path that will eventually end in our death.  It may come a few weeks after conception or years after our birth but it will happen.  Let's take care of those who are born and here in need of our help.  We don't need to drag more unwanted children into this world until we can give the one's living here and now a decent life.	FAVOR

Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the woman and her doctor apply when making these tough decisions? I don't think so.Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of abortions performed when there are better options?

A self-aware human should not be aborted.That is not a self-aware human, no matter how cute.

There are two extremes:1) The moment after conception.2) The moment of birth.My problem with number one is that a single celled organism shouldn't have rights that are equal to those of a person, and my problem with number two is that mere physical location (outside rather than inside the womb) shouldn't dictate whether we have rights, so I propose that the embryo/fetus gains rights over time as it develops.

Therefore, I will attempt to do so now.The issue of abortion is one which goes much deeper than pro-life v. pro-choice. The issue at hand is taking away the choice to commit an act which is completely private. My ultimate concern is that banning abortion essentially strips women of their right to choose. This, in itself, is completely against everything that America, in my opinion, stands for. So, I would like to step past the argument that the issue at hand is ""taking the life of an innocent human being"".One of the main elements of America that makes it so great is the reality that the state respects the right to privacy and ensures American citizens freedom. Therefore, I believe that when these freedoms, the right to choose, and the rights of American citizens to live without the government infringing upon their private lives are stripped away we being to regress into one of the many societies which we speak out against every day.The issue of living under laws which one disagrees with is in my opinion an erroneous one. We as Americans, must ensure that every person maintains the right to privacy and the freedom to choose as long as those rights and freedoms do not infringe upon the rights and freedoms of others. Allowing for women, if they so choose, to get an abortion in no way infringes upon the rights of other American citizens.  The same is true for gay marriages. Furthermore, allowing women to choose whether or not to receive an abortion is in no way forcing a viewpoint onto the entire populace. However, forbidding the right to choose does exactly that.Stripping American citizens of their rights is a very dangerous game. We must remember our roots and ensure that we do not begin stripping away at the layers of freedom. America, after all, was created to ensure that people maintain freedom and that the state can in no way infringe upon those freedoms.Banning abortion like banning gay marriage is a very slippery slope and speeds up the possibility of America regressing into that which we fought and continue to fight so hard against."

2917	abortion	I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions. Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception: Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasnÕt living so it wouldnÕt matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasnÕt living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldnÕt even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being. This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isnÕt a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesnÕt begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them. Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that theyÕre too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girlÕs parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesnÕt want to deal with the baby. First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. ThatÕs 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, ÒBefore I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.Ó The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you canÕt see or feel the baby inside of you, doesnÕt mean itÕs not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should. There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isnÕt it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the motherÕs womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie. Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law. In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies. Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong.

Removing the MCP allows institutions in other countries on both sides of the issue to petition for aid. There is nothing implicitly stating that all the aid is going to institutions that only promote abortions, it simply allows them the same right which pro life entities have (exclusively under the MCP). the MCP was completely undemocratic by refusing any chance to ask for aid to those who promote   abortion  .Besides the bad allegory of abortion to slavery, you start with a false premise that everyone agrees on when human life begins. This is not the case, where as with slavery there is no confusion about what is wrong (and even that is a contemporary lack of confusion, because the states of succession certainly held a different point of view during that time).About individual contributions I agree that the same can be done for the pro life side as well.

2922	abortion	To your first point:What you are arguing for is the view known in German as; Lebensunwertes Leben or The Life Unworthy of Life. This was the philosophy that drove the Holocaust of Nazi Germany and the one currently underway here in America. To learn more about this follow this link  Why do I say this? Because you take a class of humans and then give reasons ( very poor ones) of why they should not be allowed to live.In Nazi Germany they said; This human should not live because of X. And you say that this human should not live because of X. There is a direct correlation here and I hope you see it. When you get a chance also pick up the book  From Darwin to Hitler by Dr. Richard WeikartNow to your question of when do you begin to class a fetus as a human?At the moment of conception. Because at that point you now have a complete and distinct human DNA in the cell. There is no way around this; humans produce humans and dogs produce dogs. About a contraception that is 100% effective every time. It's known as abstinence. Practice it faithfully and you will never get pregnant or an STD. Fail to practice it and pay the price with your life and possibly that of your child's. And if you do have an unwanted pregnancy, Please consider adoption. Did you know that 1 out of every 6 couples are infertile. Do the math, that's a lot of couples who want to have children and can't. And I'm one of them. It cost me 14,000 dollars to have my daughter and it tears me up inside to know that some parents just discard their children like trash. There are thousands of us out here who are screaming; please don't kill it, we'll take it. You'd also be surprised to know the high number of Americans who adopt from over seas; and why do they? There aren't enough children to be adopted here because of abortion.You noted well that I see this issue as black and white. It's called moral clarity. When looking at evil I call it as it is; evil. Final thought: Were you ever a fetus? Because if you were, Then you have to acknowledge that if your mother would have had an abortion it would have ended your life, not something else, but your life. Think about that and look at it real hard because that's what abortion does; it ends the life of a human being in the early stages of development.And if you were born after 1972, I challenge you to consider yourself a Survivor of the Abortion Holocaust. 1/3 of your generation has been killed by abortion in America!

On the premise that abortion isn't murder? What if your premise is wrong?You also state her grief is illogical because there was no conscious being there.  Is it ok to murder people as long as they're not conscious- such as when they're asleep? Anyway how do you scientifically prove or define the consciousness of another.  Maybe we should kill people with Alzehimers.A woman grieves the loss of her baby because she knows exactly what it was: her very own offspring.  It's perfectly logical to mourn the loss of one's own child.  Everyone has to base their beliefs on some sort of paradigm.  As a Christian I am basing my paradigm on something outside myself. I'm basing it on what God has revealed to mankind through the Bible.  If you don't base your beliefs on God's word what are you basing it on? Your own limited understanding? You aren't omniscient so the most you should do is at least err on the side of life: ""I'm not sure it's murder so to be on the safe side I'll choose life."" If you can devalue life at one level you can devalue it at any level. As John Donne said, if even a simpleton is killed I am the lesser. We are all a part of mankind and no one has the right to take another's life- not even at it's simplest and most helpless state. Finally, your statement that those that regret abortion are free to feel that way but that should not cause us to restrict the choice of others.  No, our feelings should not restrict others' choices and behaviors but right and wrong should.  People knew it was wrong to keep slavery legal so they abolished it.  People knew it was wrong to force young children to work as adults so laws were implemented to prevent it. It's wrong to discriminate against people based on the color of their skin or gender. Because there is such a thing as right or wrong we enforce laws that maintain right and wrong and we change laws that don't (such as slavery or segregation).  Just because abortion is legal doesn't make it right.  One day I believe people will look back in horror at the 40+million unborn children that have been murdered in our country.  "	AGAINST

The world is overpopulated as it is. Humans continue to grow at a rate that is unsustainable, and at some point nature will regulate us through some mass disaster/disease. Until then, however, abortion at least offers a little self regulation of population growth.	FAVOR

2933	abortion	When the Pope speaks definitively on fiath and morals, it is infallible.  Many things have been declared infallible since 1870.  The teaching barring birth control is one example. It was definitively declared by Pope Paul VI in the encyclical Humanae Vitae, which was written specifically for that purpose.  Pope John Paul II wrote the encyclical Evangelium Vitae for a similar purpose--the bishops had asked him to clarify/codify Catholic teaching regarding life issues such as abortion and euthanasia.  The Church's anti-abortion stance was also clearly published in the Catechism of the Catholic Church which is approved and released by the Vatican undr the direction of Pope John Paul II to clearly lay out that which the Chiurch considers to be core Catholic teachings.  The Church's teaching against abortion is indeed infallible.  You are correct in your understanding of what constitutes an infallible statement in regard to codifying as doctrine matters of traditional belief, such as the Assumption of Mary.  But definitive statements from the Pope in regard to issues of faith and morals also morally obligate all Catholics and are both infallible and unchangable.	AGAINST

2935	abortion	"Ok, the central theme thing is completely unfair, considering you were the one who originally argued about porn, Ted Bundy, premarital sex, and the like. I merely countered your argument. So in reality your central theme seems to be sex. I won't disagree with your argument entirely. There are certainly a number of drawbacks to the sexual revolution. Namely in terms of the feminist revolution. We've taken a number of steps backwards in some inane desire to please men. The ""playboy effect"" is a very negative behavior that has resulted from the sexual revolution. This does not mean that the sexual revolution was all bad or that sex outside of marriage is bad. It's quite a jump to say that sex is only ok in a lifelong heterosexual marriage except for religious reasons. From a religious context, sure, it makes perfect sense, but outside of that it does not. For one, ""lifelong"" partnerships sometimes don't last a lifetime. For another, people are biologically programmed to sexual desires. Sex is a very fulfilling part of a serious, committed relationship, and I stand by my statement that there is nothing wrong with that.

Thousands of women die around the world because they don't have access to birth control, or medical care during pregnancy nor a place to go to have babies delivered.  Beating women into submission about abortion is cruel and uncaring.  I'd like to see the enforced pregnancy crowd do more to make sure all children are wanted, have medical care, food, shelter, and parents who can parent.  You want to stop women, millions who are completely unknown to you, from seeking solutions to their private problems.  Yet, when that child is born you turn your backs.  You tell women that it's their fault that they got pregnant. How many times I've seen remarks like ""close your legs next time"" or ""your mistake isn't my responsibility"" on message boards.  We have over 9 million children in the United States who have no medical coverage.  Where is the pro-pregnancy crowd on that issue?  Siding with George Bush that they should have any because we don't want to cut into the insurance companies profit margins or raise taxes to help pay for it.  Why is an embryo sacred and a child no more than someone else's mistake?We have approximately 1.2 million abortions performed in the U.S. every year.  Are you going to find one million couples who are willing to adopt a child, every year?  Over turning Roe would only increase problems but then you folks are all for that. Let others get the burden of trying to solve them.  As far as you're concerned you did your job. We have nearly 500,000 children living in foster care.  Half of those are available for adoption.  Many will live in the system because they have past issues, siblings, are the wrong color for some folks, or have medical problems.  Once they turn 18 they are out of the system except those with medical disabilities.  They have no family to help them.  Where are you people in regards to them?  Why are there so many of these children living in these situations?  Why aren't you making a real effort to get these kids out of foster care and into a good home?  Roe was based on privacy so tell me, how is woman having an abortion any of your business?  Unless it's your wife, daughter, or another relative I really can't see why you have any right to interfere.  Make the world a welcome place for a child.  Help pass laws that provide a living wage to working women and health care for them.  Make sure they have good food to eat every day and a safe place to live.  Provide help to parents when they are under going the stresses of parenting.  Let no child have to live in a homeless shelter.  When we can solve these major problems then let's sit down and have a chat about the morality of poking your nose into other people's privacy.Oh, and by the way, I've had two safe legal abortions in my life.  No, I don't feel guilty and no, I don't regret my decision.  My spiritual beliefs say embryos aren't fully human and until they take that first breathe they are not of this world.  So you see, I'm not buying into your guilt trip.  Your concept of God seems to make that deity pretty weak and incompetent as far as I'm concerned.  How you choose to worship your god is your business but you have no right to force me to live according to those beliefs.

Rights are recognized in context. And in the context of a woman's adult life, it is her right to decide, within the first trimester, that must be recognized.

2959	abortion	"We can all agree that a fertilized egg is alive. But so also is an unfertilized egg or a sperm. They're not dead, and they're not inanimate objects like a stone. Almost every cell in my body is alive. Life began eons ago, and continues uninterrupted from one generation to the next. So we're not talking about the beginning of life, but the beginning of a particular living individual.Genetically, we could say that a new individual begins when a new combination of genes emerges. This happens whenever an egg or a sperm is formed, and it happens again when an egg combines with a sperm. The latter combination usually lasts longer than the former, but does that make it the only beginning of an individual?And when a fertilized egg divides into two identical twins with no change in genetic profile, are they both still the same individual as was the original cell? If not -- if identical twins are different individuals, then unique genetics must not be the definition of a unique individual. So what is the significance of the fertilization of an egg? Maybe a fertilzed egg is just a potential human being, or dog, or whatever, in the same way that a sperm or unfertilized egg is. Maybe it's the development of a functioning, thinking brain with a unique mind that constitutes the beginning of an individual. That seems to make sense.The religious, of course, substitute the word ""soul"" for ""mind,"" and they speculate blindly about when the soul is assigned to the body, having absolutely no information on the subject. Interestingly, as well, I believe they tend to conceive of the soul as much more mature than the rudimentary single-cell body it supposedly inhabits, capable from the beginning of self-awareness and thought and probably a love of God. That's why killing a brainless single cell is repulsive to them. It really is just a religious issue."	FAVOR

Rather than banning it, we need to be working towards making abortion pretty much unneccesary. This is much harder to do than simply banning it, but does have the advantage of actually solving the problems posed both by allowing and by prohibiting abortion rather than just ignoring them."

However, the Church always viewed abortion as a great evil at any stage of pregnancy.  Modern embryology now confirms what the Church knew all along --life begins at conception.  That is a scientific fact, not a religious belief.  At the moment of conception a human life has been created.  That life may end before birth through miscarriage or abortion, but it was a human life.

Seriously: i am against all abortion (and this is my opinion) because it simply terminates the life of a human being's life cycle. Science has proved that this cycle begins at conception and ends permanently with death. I simply think it's wrong to make a distinction of humans based on any discimination as declared in the universal declaration of Human rights article2: Size, Location, Stage of development, etc... To argue that a fetus is not human is simply false.If we agree with this we have to give all humans the same rights. The only exception to abortion, in my opinion, has to be when the life of the mother is at risk.This is to save the only life who would survive if we didn't intervene."	AGAINST

She goes to the doctor from pain in her belly and wants to be assured everything is OK. She finds out she has a serious complication that in which, she has to make a decision: a) wait at least another month hoping she can last that long so the baby can be born (prematurely, but hopefully alive enough to survive) and she dies, guaranteed, or b) abort the child for her life. Which one should she pick? If she picks b) does that mean she's a selfish bitch and a ""murderer"" just because she wanted to live longer for, probably, her children she already has, her husband, and because letting her child have her life without his mother would suck just as much itself? (Even though, in most of these cases, the mother will pick option a0 and the husband will try to talk her out of it).So, sure, you can call abortion murder as much as you all want, but it's getting really out of hand. For someone to make a wise and rational decision of aborting a fetus for whatever their reason, takes a lot more guts than you'll ever think. Also to mention, to put the word ""Murder"" up there is just REALLY low. I mean, you're making all these women feel like they should probably commit suicide by having a murder label on them. It's harsh. Alas, what if we gave an eldery person a drug so they could finally pass away upon their wishes? I'm sure that would be in the same category as ""Murder"" yet, a lot of people are fighting for something like this to be legal itself (it's only legal with doctor consent in Oregon). So, really, I don't think abortion is murder, nor do I think it is a selfish, I think all of you calling it murder and selfish are selfish. :-)"	FAVOR

I've changed one key word, tell me if it changes anything.The debate is not about whether or not slavery is sometimes the best course of action, but whether or not a government agency has the right to make laws mandating that a man may not have a slave. There are various good reasons for having slaves. There are even more reasons a man may choose to have a slave that are not good. Is it the business of the state to intervene and evaluate the reasoning process that the buyer and seller apply when making these tough decisions? I don't think so.Allowing government entities to have the final irrevocable say in such situations sets a precedent that puts the government in a too high of a position relative to our fundamental liberties.What can we do short of legislation to significantly reduce the number of slaves traded when there are better options? People like me who abhor slavery need to focus on putting the alternatives front and center.Hope that clears things up for you.	AGAINST

3016	abortion	I wrote this speech...read it and it will answer your questions.Abortion: Choose Life-it begins at Conception: Think about this. A girl had an abortion, thinking that the baby wasnÕt living so it wouldnÕt matter. But, after she had the abortion, she saw what she thought wasnÕt living, and it actually was. The baby was living and she watched it die. From then on, she couldnÕt even live with herself knowing that she killed a living human being. This story that I just told you is true. A lot of women think that it isnÕt a baby before they have the abortion, and I will explain to you that abortion is the killing of a living baby. Well, if life doesnÕt begin at birth, then when does it begin? Life begins at conception. This is a fact, because there is a lot of proof that can back that fact up. For example, there is scientific proof and there is Biblical proof. To further explain what abortion is, I will talk about these important things: one, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, two, how scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception, Three, what we can do about the abortions, and finally, why girls get abortions. Those are all the things that should be thought about, so I will be explaining them, to help you understand them.Some woman have abortions because of these three things: one, They might think that theyÕre too young to have a baby, two, their boyfriend or spouse makes them have an abortion, three, if they do have the abortion the girlÕs parents would get mad at her. The case also might be that she just doesnÕt want to deal with the baby. First, you probably ought to know what abortion is. Abortion is killing the baby inside you when you are pregnant. Every year 1.5 million babies are killed by abortion. ThatÕs 125,000 babies killed a month, making it 4,000 babies killed each day, or one baby killed every 20 seconds, that is so amazingly awful. That is basically one murder happening every 20 seconds. How brutal. The fact that life begins at conception is spiritually right. As it says in the Bible; Jeremiah 1:5 says, ÒBefore I formed you in the womb, I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.Ó The Bible says that life begins at conception, meaning that right at conception the baby becomes a living human being. There are many Bible verses that back up the fact that life begins at conception, like the one I just said. That Bible verse, Jeremiah 1:5 is saying that God intended a unique human being, starting at conception. Just because you canÕt see or feel the baby inside of you, doesnÕt mean itÕs not a baby, and alive and a human being, just like you. That is what a lot of people do not think about, even though you really should. There also is scientific proof. Some people may think that life begins at birth, or some people even later, but that is wrong, life begins at conception. Because of the fact that the baby forms gradually after conception, then conception is the only real point where you can say that the baby is a living human being. For example, the heart beat starts gradually, over a period of time so conception is the only exact starting point of life. Also, DNA defines a separate human being, and so when does a person form their own DNA? A person gets their own DNA at conception. That is a whole lot of proof, so it is just like saying it is a crime to kill a 1 year old, so why isnÕt it a crime to kill a baby when he or she is still in the motherÕs womb? That is a question that probably will go unanswered forever, or they will just say that the baby is not living, which is a complete lie.  Now, what can we do about abortion? There many things that we can do about abortion. If you start supporting this pro-life movement then it will keep growing so much then no one will have an abortion. Hopefully then the abortion clinics will shut down, and the law will have to change. But, most importantly you can change the hearts of the people who support abortion, and save the innocent little babies. Now, how can we stop abortion? There are many ways to help stop abortion. Another way is you can donate money to a place like The Pregnancy Resource Center and they will use it to buy an ultrasound machine and to then show the women their babies to try to convince them not to have an abortion. You can also write to the president or another government representative, and tell them about all this proof that I have told you, hoping that their hearts will change and then the law. In conclusion to all of this, it is spiritually right that life begins at conception, and scientifically there is proof that life begins at conception. There are many ways that you can help stop abortion, so I hope that you take a while and do that. There are a lot of things wrong with having an abortion, so you really should not have one. Just remember that God loves the person getting the abortion AND the beautiful, innocent little babies.Thank you and I hope that you have realized that life begins at conception, you should help the pro-life movement, and that having an abortion is wrong.

3025	abortion	"Our definitions are essentially the same, you just misapply the definition.""The range of capabilities that someone or something has; powers or resources not yet developed or made use of.""  While, like most dictionary definitions, this is vague and not completely accurate in a philosophical sense, it is still mostly correct.  My definition is essentially the same as well, but taken from Aristotle's definition of potentiality, ""Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if it is not prevented by something else.""Common definitions are a slippery idea. For example, presently the word ""liberal"" (in a political context) is defined as one who seeks greater government regulation and an expansion of welfare programs.  However, the original definition of ""liberal"" defined a person who believed in severely limited government and free-market capitalism.  In fact, many founders of the Libertarian movement considered themselves ""liberals.""Even using your ""exact"" definition (assuming that we have an exact definition and not just a colloquial summary, you are still confusing potentiality with possibility.In effect, you are interpreting the definition as if you could say, ""a person has the potential to be hit by a car.""  This makes no logical sense.  That person however exists with that possibility.Indeed, you could argue that the wood has the potential to be a table.  Yes, this is correct when certain linguistic obscurities are overlooked.  The can the wood actually do? Nothing.  That is, until it is made into something.  So what we should say is the wood has the potential to be made into a table, not to be a table.Now, considering your absurd example, If your appendix cell where on the street completely alone, it would not have human rights. It is no longer part of your entity.  This is the same idea as, if your hair falls out in my house or car, I can dispose of it.  It is no longer ""your"" hair.  As long as a thing is connected to you and is of your person-hood it is completely yours and I cannot touch itA fetus is connected to the mother, but it is not of her person-hood and should at least qualify for certain basic rights. Your example of in vitro makes no logical sense.   I never said that a scientifically engineered human wouldn't be human.  I said, the cells that they make them out of are not potential humans, when the cells are considered individually.  Once they have been engineered into a fetus, then they are definitely potential humans. You are quoting me out of context.  My argument was that a single sperm is not ""a potential human until it unites with an egg.""  No, a single sperm will not become a human of its own accord.  It would have to be made into a human.  In essence, it is a potential potentiality, but anything can be broken down into degrees or potential potentiality.  So that is a concept we should stay away from. Anyhow, I would appreciate it if you would not take my statements out of context and apply meanings to them that I never stated. Don't be mistaken, I never once said or implied that I would make   abortion   illegal, nor do I speculate as to the application of these certain basic rights of a fetus or whose, mother's or fetus', rights take precedence in what cases. All I said was you misapplied the concept of potentiality."	AGAINST
3026	abortion	This is a speech that i found:On behalf of the Salt & Light team, I would like to speak to you about a subject that is near and dear to our hearts. Today is National Sanctity of Human Life day. Perhaps you have noticed the pro-life sign in front of our church. If not, I invite you to look at it after the service this morning.Thirty years ago, the United States Supreme Court made up a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade. Since then there have been 44 million abortions. There have been 112 million births. Using those two numbers, one can calculate that 28 percent of all pregnancies have ended in abortion. Everyday the number of babies killed by abortionists approximately equals the 3,000 killed by terrorists on September 11, 2001.Now I believe that I do not have to convince anyone here in this church about the evilness and tragedy of abortion. But, if anyone remains unconvinced, go over to our nursery, pick up a little baby, hold it in your arms and gaze into its eyes and you will know the truth. All the pro-choice pro-abortion rhetoric will just melt away.The real question to be asked is why, in this predominately-Christian nation, do we tolerate this practice? I have spent three years trying to answer that question. I must tell you that I am totally amazed. There really should be no debate at all about abortion. The truth should be clear to everyone. It should be a slam-dunk that abortion should not be tolerated. It should not be legalized. And it should not be a choice. After studying this issue, I now understand how Adolf Hitler was able to pull off the holocaust. It took a tremendous amount of propaganda, lies, and deceit. The Nazis were able to morally confuse many people. It took many good Christians in Germany closing their eyes and remaining silent.Well the same thing is true today in the United States of America. There are a relatively few passionate activists who loudly spread pro-choice pro-abortion propaganda, lies, and deceit. They are able to morally confuse many people in our country. It is a sad truth that most Christians in all denominations have closed their eyes and have remained silent.The abortion struggle has corrupted our politics. Legalized abortion is so entrenched in our government because one of our two major political parties has embraced it. To even be considered a viable candidate in that party one must blindly accept the doctrine of legalized abortion. This has made it difficult for the Christians who are traditionally members of that party. Every election cycle, pro-choice candidates try to give Christians reasons to vote for them on other issues. And so, too many Christians forget about abortion as they go vote. They often provide the margin of victory for pro-choice pro-abortion candidates. If a miracle were to happen and those Christians were to hold a little baby in their arms and gaze into his or her eyes just before stepping into the voting booth, our system of abortion would disappear after the very next election.In conclusion, the most important thing I have learned during these last three years is that the future of abortion is totally in the hands of Christians. We really do have the political power to solve this problem. Our cultural enemies know this and they are scared. They desperately work to demonize and marginalize us. We do not have to convince the sinful pro-choice activists that they are wrong about abortion. We do not have to convince the radical feminists, the biased news media, or the morally corrupt politicians. To win, all we have to do is convince our fellow Christians to truly follow Christ and there is no doubt that they will vote pro-life.	FAVOR
3027	abortion	"Quote from previous commenters: ""...in 2002 alone there were 357 maternal deaths in the USA."" It is true that indeed giving birth is NOT without its risks.But successful abortion carries a 100% rate of risk of death to the child. And in contrast to the unfortunate 357 maternal deaths we see an unfortunate rate of almost 1.3 MILLION infant deaths in 2002 to abortion (        ).I suspect it is one's ego that is willing to value one life more than another... or one life more than 3,613 others.In response to ""A woman has a right over what happens inside her body,"" actually I believe what the previous commenter was trying to say was ""A woman has the right over her own body.""

People assuming they are sovereign and have the right to murder others- even more horrific- their own flesh and blood.     How in the world do you deduce that giving life through carrying your baby to term dehumanizes you? Giving life doesn't dehumanize us, taking it away does.  The ultimate form of slavery and dehumanization is when a person does not value another's life.  If we can not value the life of our own   children   when they are in the womb what makes any life valuable?  When one does not trust God and His sovereignty, even in instances of rape, life has no meaning or hope.  When one trusts God's sovereignty we know that even   pregnancy   from rape can bring hope and meaning.    Aborting a baby conceived from rape will not rid the mother of the trauma of rape it only compounds it by making her guilty of murder.    	AGAINST

3055	abortion	This is going to be a deeply deranged argument, because the terms in which it is couched are badly flawed.What do you mean: 'life'?On purely biochemical grounds, sperm and ovae are 'alive'. So the embryo will obviously be 'alive' as well. But to extrapolate from this to the conclusion that an embryo represents 'human life' and thus should be afforded full human rights is ludicrous weaselling and sophistry.What distinguishes my appendix from an embryo? They have the same chromosomes - does my appendix deserve 'rights'? Should I be allowed to have it surgically removed?Some will object that an embryo has potential to become a human. But so does a sperm or ovum - to which we accord no rights of humanity whatsoever - given circumstances that are only slightly more complex.And so, in fact, does a cell from my appendix, if certain procedures are followed and the nucleus is extracted and inserted into an oocyte. If potential is the yardstick, any living human tissue has it, and I can see no sensible line of argument for special treatment of fertilised ovae that would not also apply to other tissue, or to gametes.Happily, apart from some religious ideologues and dogmatists, few people try to maintain such nonsense. Most tend to adopt an uneasy acceptance that somewhere along the process of gestation, a lump of tissue acquires sufficient similarity to a true human to acquire the rights that a human has. Unfortunately, this feeling is heavily influenced by the instinctive protective drive that all animals have for their young, and biased by it.Interestingly, the Old Testament has a much more pragmatic approach, in which children are not considered people for practical purposes until they have reached the age of around one month.

3066	abortion	You have a very cold view of the rights of a rape victim.  As to your other views, I do not believe that a fetus should have the rights of a fully-developed human being until it's systems are able to function independently outside the uterus (not get it's own bottle and change it's own diaper, but simply breathe oxygen, process food and eliminate waste independently, without reliance on its mother's body to do these things FOR it.  As long as it is fully reliant upon her body to carry out these processes and incapable of doing so on its own, it is functionally a PART of her body, and her rights supercede its rights.According to YOUR model, the rights of the fetus TAKE PRECEDENCE over the rights of the mother.  According to your model, the woman who becomes pregnant CEASES to have human rights until a baby is delivered or the pregnancy spontaneously aborts.  Why should the fetus have MORE rights than the fully-developed independent human being in whose body it resides?  This is a situation in which the rights of one being will HAVE to supercede the rights of another.  Whether the rights of the fetus supercede those of the mother, or the rights of the mother supercede those of the fetus is the question, at its heart.  Therefore, since only one of the two is capable of surviving independently of the other, the reasonable choice would seem to be that the individual capable of independent survival has the right to do so.  Since the fetus cannot survive without taking over the body of the mother and without forcing her to forego her rights to function as she chooses and to medically control her own body, the fetus has fewer rights than the mother.

Yes, that should have read ""..to protect the health of the mother"".Don't get me wrong, ussitano, I'm not in favor of abortions at all for the same reasons you give. But the reality of it is we will never end abortions; there are just too many legitimate reasons why society wants and needs to have them. I would never want a woman who was raped to be forced to carry to term a pregnancy that may result from that attack. This also applies in cases of incest. And if we know a fetus is severely deformed, I can also understand the desire to terminate it. I'm a little less understanding of those who simply failed to use protection and now think of it as an inconvenience. However, prior to 28 weeks the embryo/fetus is not considered viable and so if there are reasons to end the pregnancy, I'd prefer to allow it then with the understanding that beyond 28 weeks   abortion   would be extremely restricted.To those who claim this is already the case I would point out every piece of legislation that attempts to restrict late term abortions has more loopholes than carter has pills. And while the percentage of abortions in the third trimester is low, when you consider the total number of abortions for any given year, it's still a very large number of viable fetuses that are being terminated every year. There is far too much ambiguity in the laws today and the differences in various state laws allow people to simply go to a state that will allow them."	FAVOR
3071	abortion	"So what then, is the ""the purpose for which it was designed"" if not procreation? Pleasure?! Say it's not so! I would say man has a nature and that it is fixed. And it is for this reason that I strongly believe in not banning abortions and I strongly believe that abstinence only education should be replaced by comprehensive sexual education. Because part of that fixed nature of man is that each of us has impulses and desires of a sexual nature. (And those impulses and desires are not wrong.) Acting upon them is not a matter of ethics or morality. I've never understood how sexual activity came under the morality umbrella to begin with. So long as it is consensual, there's no justification. We don't analyze other types of activity for their moral fiber. Do we talk about the morality of football? The morality of swimming? The morality of sleeping? Laws, as I stated earlier, should be based on the good of society, namely not causing harm to other people, while protecting each person's individual rights to do all things that do not cause harm to others. Ethics are not fixed, else we would all have identical ethical standards. How do you account for the differences if there is to be but one ideal? LoL at the sexual revolution bringing bondage. How is safe sex prior to marriage harmful to both parties, though? If you're responsible, no transmission of STD's, no unwanted pregnancies, what is the damage you speak of? As for the life expectancy of a gay man, consider this: homosexuals are 26 times more likely to die from suicide and 87 times more likely to die from murder than heterosexuals. Which says a lot about more about tolerance than it does about lifestyle. Nonetheless, your argument is moot anyway, because homosexuals do not choose to be homosexual. That's not a lifestyle choice, so it cannot be right or wrong. Would you say when you make a choice to walk barefoot you are also making the choice to host a ringworm inside of you? It's something that could be a consequence of that choice, but it's not a choice you've made. It's an effect. Similarly, impregnation is an effect of sex. Not a choice in and of itself. The choice ought to come prior to impregnation, when one can choose to prevent it through contraception. But sometimes it comes after. Nonetheless, it's up to the individual to make that choice. The examples I gave represent the reasons abortion ought to be accessible. I agree that it should not be used as birth control. I agree that we ought to reduce the number. I believe comprehensive sexual education with access to contraception is the best way to achieve that. You seem to think that just telling them not to do it and crossing our fingers is best. It's just...jaded. There are about 150,000 children up for adoption per year. I'm not sure how many adoptive couples. My point is, would adoptive couples be able to keep demand up for that many unwanted children were we to abolish abortion today? Again, let me specify. When I say ""prohibition doesn't work"" I mean prohibition of things that people recognize to be false laws. These would be laws regarding our bodies. Laws that tell us how we can use them (sex) and what we can put in them (drugs) do not work. People recognize the invalidity of these laws because they understand their bodies are ultimately theirs to do with what they please. Just go through the supermarket check-out and peruse the latest magazine covers. If you don't know what this does to the male mind and the way it victimizes women you are numb.Holy cow you've got to be joking! Victimizes women?! Let me start a new debate for this alone. Please visit it at                                        Do_magazines_victimize_women I'm all for teaching kids what's best for them. And what's best for them are the tools to make the best decisions for themselves. And those decisions, like it or not, are ultimately up to them to make. It's naiive to believe that all it will take is a strong voice repetitively shouting the abstinence mantra in order to keep people from having premarital sex. Abstinence is fail proof. You may fail to abstain but if you are abstaining you will never get pregnant. However contraception is not so. You can also fail to use it but if you use it, it can fail and you will get pregnant. It's that simple. And this is a fine way to teach sexual education. I'm not against an abstinent-leaning program, but one that does not promote healthy sexual habits at all is dangerous. We've got to take into account those who will fail to abstain. Not doing so is heartless. As far as the Ted Bundy bit goes, I really see no bearing here. That's specifically regarding pornography, which I'd be glad to debate the merits of in another debate. Final thought:Morals are relative, which is all I'm trying to push on you. My only ""push"" is that you not push legislation on others based solely on your moral beliefs."	FAVOR

Any time someone makes a choice about getting pregnant, not getting pregnant, carrying a pregnancy to term, or not carrying the pregnancy to term, they are doing something that controls the population. Granted, these decisions are on an individual level, so it may seem like no one really has ""control"" -- but that's the level on which NGOs providing OB/GYN and prenatal services would be working, too.

We do not have a black and white system where every human gets the same treatment. It is a crime to sterilize someone against their will. That is assault on the potential parent, not the potential children. Somewhere along the way the potential child starts to get rights independent of the potential parent.

3080	abortion	Assigning a beginning is trivial from a distance and gets harder the closer you look. In some ways it is even more complex with fruit flies than with humans, since nurse cells with maternal genetics govern the development of the early embryo for quite a while before the genetics of the embryo take over. There is no scientific need to define the beginning of something more broadly than for the experiment that you are conducting. When wildlife biologists count gazelles they choose a definition that works for them. When neurobiologists study neural development they wait until some point in development when a particular event happens. This question (when does life start?) is not a scientific one. I am a scientist, but I am not claiming to have authority regarding the issue, except where others make a false claim of scientific conclusion.With regards to the simple firsts, meiosis is the first event that gives rise to a unique genetic combination that will become part of a new person. Conception is another later event that can be described the same way. Conception is special, because pregnancy is special. All pregnancies have emotional importance to the people involved and should be viewed as having a moral 'worth.' That is why we should work to reduce abortions.

This subject is debatable even if you say it isn't.I take particular exception to this statement, ""A new and unique, and complete human organism exists at conception.""At conception there is a single cell that, more likely than not, possess errors that will prevent it from becoming a complete organism. Even in the case where the fertilized egg has no defects it is not a complete human - the hardest, most miraculous parts of becoming a complete human organism are still to come. You appear to be equating the potential to be complete with actually being complete. I believe there is an important difference between an acorn and an oak tree.You are wrong when you say, ""When a new human life exists- ie, when there is a new organism which is alive and which is a member of our species- is incontrovertibly established by science as being at conception."" The phrase, ""incontrovertibly established by science,"" is far from true.Scientists as a group do not agree on this very debate. The question is, ""when is there something new?"" Many biologists that deal in whole organisms (e.g. organismal biologists, ecologists, etc.) use a definition that includes ""independent"" when counting the members of a species. Geneticists mark conception as the creation of a unique gene combination that is then subject to selective pressures. However, they will tell you that the same thing is true at the onset of a cancer. Many neuroscientists put the creation of something new significantly later, when neural or even cognitive activity begins. Immunologists tend to put importance on the start of the self-selection process when the developing embryo begins to distinguish (at a molecular, not cognitive, level) between self and non-self. It is not true that science has shown conception to be the most important beginning. There are many firsts in each cycle of life, each of them equally necessary for the continuity of life. Our modern popular obsession with the importance of DNA leads to the idea that conception is the most important benchmark. I don't think it is. Oh, and a trope can certainly be true."	FAVOR

I know that a lot of times it is extremely difficult to for a woman to cope with an unplanned pregnancy, but i think that ultimately, the government should make abortion illegal, but in turn provide programs to help the woman through this hard time and make the right choice in what to do with the child after birth, whether it would be adoption, or keeping the baby, in order to preserve life. I also think that the government should provide more funding for to take care of the children in the foster care system.

Animals do not have rights and are the property of their owners. If you deny this, then you cannot claim a right to eat meat and wear leather.

You also make a great leap down a very slippery slope.Degrees of ""out of the birth canal"" is not fundamental here; what is fundamental is the nature of the entity. Again, a fetus becomes a person at birth. The laws of nature eventually result in a fetus becoming survivable, fully formed, its organs functioning autonomously, and the whole organism becoming metaphysically independent, and at that time, the law of cause-and-effect induces childbirth. Nature, or reality, is what sets the standard, not medical technology or the arbitrary say-so of people. We must deal with a thing as it is, now how we can imagine it or emote it to be.Frankly, your question, ""Where do you get the notion that humans have rights?"" is scarier than any coldly rational argument I could ever make about anything.

A sperm will also not become a human, but must be combined with an egg first and be within the uterus to be classified as a potentially human.

I recently read this article (link is at the end) ct. 15, 2008 -- The U.S. ranks 29th worldwide in infant mortality, tying Slovakia and Poland but lagging behind Cuba, the CDC reports.The CDC's latest estimates for international rankings are based on 2004 data. But as of 2005, the numbers haven't changed much since 2000.Nearly seven U.S. babies die out of every 1,000 live births. More than 28,000 American babies die before their first birthday.""The U.S. infant mortality rate is higher than rates in most other developed countries,"" note CDC researchers Marian F. MacDorman, PhD, and T.J. Mathews. ""The relative position of the United States in comparison to countries with the lowest infant mortality rates appears to be worsening.""What's going on? Racial and ethnic disparities clearly play a role. In 2005, for every 1,000 live births, the infant mortality rate was:    * 13.63 among non-Hispanic black Americans    * 5.76 among non-Hispanic white AmericansPremature birth is a factor in more than two-thirds of infant deaths. From 2000 to 2005, the U.S. preterm birth rate went up from 11.6% to 12.7%.Rather than spend so much time, energy and resources (both human and financial) on stopping women from having abortions, why not dedicate yourselves to helping solve some of the problems above?

3106	abortion	"My favorite line by Jon OBrien is ""hard cases make bad   law  ."" It is easy for people with limited experience to make harsh judgements on certain issues, especially if they are indoctrinated when they are young by religious beliefs.    ""Hard cases make bad laws."" ""People arguing to the contrary are attemtpting to justify   murder   with a lot of rhetoric (professing themselves wise they became fools."") Biblical quote, I assume.   In 1969, before   abortion   became   legal   in this country, the doctor who delivered me 11 years before treated me after I had been raped by a stranger in my own bed with my whole family asleep in the house. With tears in his eyes, he ensured that I would not have my rapist's baby at age 12. According to you, my doctor, my parents, and I are murderers. I believe this is what Jon O Brien or anyone else would refer to as a ""hard case."" The problem with blanket judgments such as yours, and what makes abortion unique, is that a choice often has to be made between the welfare of the mother and that of the fetus, in my case, a fertilized egg. For my parents and my doctor, the choice was obvious, but not to many callous religious zealots. Forcing a child to have her rapist's child is tantamount to raping her again, yet the Catholic   church   has intervened in such cases against the child. It is sad to say that the last 15 years have shown us that the Catholic Church has turned a blind eye and even enabled horrific child abuse on a large scale, permanently damaging their credibility on any such issue to the core.These situations get very messy ethically and medically, and are best left between women and their physicians. Envision yourself at the door of an ER watching a scenario similar to the one descibed above. Most rational people would turn and run, not walk away from such a situation, with an overwhelming feeling that they had violated that family's privacy with only a glimpse and undrstanding of what was taking place. The thought of actually intervening is unfathomable when it has actual human faces. It is much easier when there are not.  Because of the numerous factors to be considered, abortion lends itself to limited legislation at best. Abortion restrictions do indeed ""make bad law.""    "	FAVOR
3107	abortion	"A zygote, if left totally alone, will die. However, if left to it's own devices as an implant in the mother's uterine lining, it may develop into a human being, it may not. A tumor, if left to its own devices on a person's body may develop into   cancer   and metastasize or may simply get larger and larger. The point is, there is no guarantee for any given outcome, only possibilities, given a set of probabilities and   conditions  . Zygotes are not like plant seeds where if you put them in the ground and give them a minimum of care, they'll sprout into fully living systems. If a mother gives her self no prenatal care she greatly reduces her chances of giving birth to a healthy or even live birth. Definitions in each argument must be clear and must have logical merit based on clear points and evidence. Therein logic can help one side or the other. A zygote cannot survive outside of the mother. It requires nutrients and other conditions (which at the present level of   technology  ) that only a mother can provide. The fact that a zygote is implanted in a mother's uterus and survives off of the mother's nutritional supply, is affected by the mother's internal milieu and homeostatic status, and does not possess a brain or consciousness and mind of its own makes it part of the mother, not a life unto its own, therefore subject to the mother's wishes for her body. At present, no technology on Earth can deliver a zygote of any placental mammalian species and keep it viable so that it develops into a live being. If the mother dies, there is a very, very small window (as in minutes) where   doctors   theoretically can find and prepare a suitable surrogate who can carry that zygote to term, but, outside those narrow conditions, without the host, be it the natural mother or surrogate, a zygote dies along with every other tissue in the mother. These conditions are the same for every other tissue in the mother's body. None of these tissues are considered to be separate lives. They can theoretically, given today's developing cloning technology generate new life. While the individual cells themselves may not be able to generate a new life, the genetic material inside, including that contained in cancer, wart or mole cells, contains a complete blueprint and theoretically only has to be transferred to a viable ovum to become a zygote and become a ""new life"". If the mother wishes to excise any of that tissue, there is no, ""separate life"" argument given. Yet, embryonic tissue that exists as a zygote/blastula/embryo/fetus that exists in the very same conditions, that would die outside of the mother or surrogate is governed under a separate set of rules and laws. My only ""  pro-life  "" argument would be that, in the human case, since the father provides genetic influence and will be subject to providing care, under   the law  , a father should have input in any decision regarding the zygote/embryo/fetus. However, since those decisions ultimately affect the mother, her   health   and body in general (not just the developing zygote/embryo/fetus) she and her   health care   provider should have ultimate say unless she designates otherwise... but all that was off topic and I apologize."

3110	abortion	"Using 'humanity' rather than 'personhood' clouds the issue, because many people will not realize that being a living human being is not the same as being a person.  When a new human life exists- ie, when there is a new organism which is alive and which is a member of our species- is incontrovertibly established by science as being at conception.  Because 'personhood'  is a subjective distinction, it could be binary or shades of grey or whatever is in the eye of the beholder.  It is a philosophical category, and not empirically verifiable.  Unfortunately, many in the public at large may hear 'humanity' and think the subject is science rather than ideology.The idea that there is no such thing as new life is an oft repeated   pro-choice   trope.  Obviously there has been life on earth since before humanity existed, and there has been a continuity of human life since the species first evolved.  That is missing the point.  Life 'in toto' isn't what is meant when the question ""When does life begin"", is asked.  New and unique lives are what is being referred to.  Otherwise, we would ask, ""When did life begin"", or ""When was there first life on earth?""  A new and unique, and complete human organism exists at conception.  That is when the life cycle begins.  That organism undergoes development and change continuously from that point until death- but the organism is complete at conception.  (I already addressed the issue of DNA indicating that a cell is a human cell without being a human beings in my previous comment.  It is just a constituent part of a human organism, but not one itself.)Again, when human life begins is clear: at conception. The only dispute regards the hazy issue of 'personhood'- which is a matter of opinion, not to mention a distinction that may not even be meaningful.  It is important to let the average person know that there is no scientific dispute, because that is the misperception that people are (intentionally?) being led to make."	AGAINST

I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of a innocent human being. The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.Roe vs Wade was a very poor decision by the Supreme Court because it introduce a major contradiction in the law. The unjustified taking of a human life is considered murder under current law and we have different degrees to further define it. Consider the fact that if you kill a woman with child; you will be charged for two counts of homicide. But if a doctor kills only one of those persons; no charge. The Supreme Court by their ruling overturned the law they were supposed to uphold. The right thing to do would be to overturn this erroneous ruling and restore our rule of law.	AGAINST
3119	abortion	"Tropes can be true, but a purely '  pro-choice   trope' is ideological. First, a brief point- then I'll address objections.  Every species has a life cycle.  The human life cycle begins at conception.  You are in a position wherein the beginning of the life cycle must of necessity be occurring to something other than a living human organism.  How can one make sense of that?  I posit that one cannot. Such a cell might not develop into an adult.  A lot of genetic anomalies prevent reaching adulthood. If one is present in an infant, that wouldn't be a basis for denying the infant is human, which brings us right back to where we started. First a question: You used the term 'miraculous'.  I won't make a silly objection about its being non-scientific. Would you permit me to use the term 'created' in a secular sense?  As in, "" at this point a new life is created.""Secondly, you contend that something isn't completely human until some point well after the organism's life cycle has begun.  How can you argue that a zygote or an embryo or a fetus (human or not) is not a living member of it's species?  If we were talking about gametes, then I'd agree. They require other cells to make a complete human. Are you using ""complete"" in another sense?  If you're using the term ""human"" as synonymous with ""person"", then you're not making a scientific observation.  Are you using it to mean ""mature"" or maybe ""independent""?  If so, you are employing an arbitrary distinction.  One could say that an organism isn't ""complete"" until it has reached the final stage of its life cycle.  Then a kitten isn't complete, but a cat capable of reproduction is.  By any objective standard, a kitten is considered a complete (albeit not fully mature) living feline. Frankly, I am confused by this.  Can you expand on it a bit?   Quite right!  I know of two cases where there are scientific disputes about when something qualifies as being alive.  The first (things like viruses and prions), I mentioned before.  The second is a seed.  A seed is an embryo which can go dormant.  That raises an interesting question: ""if it is dormant, then is it living?""  I'm not sure that there is an accepted answer.  Humans (as far as I know) don't become dormant.  I must admit that I've never heard of 'organismal biology'. I have trouble believing that any biologist would maintain that an embryo (non-dormant) isn't alive and isn't completely human or feline as the case may be. Sure, in the latter case you have a complete living cancer cell.  That's not incompatible with my position. POSSIBLY THE MOST IMPORTANT OBSERVATION:When do they ""put importance on""?  Which is ""the most important beginning""?  These are questions about value determinations.  They are questions about what to emphasize or give significance.  Now, there can be value determinations which are context specific, and therefore testable.  You've given excellent examples regarding branches of science.  ""Which of these three breakfast cereals is best?""  Is an untestable value judgment. ""Which of these three cars is best... at saving gas for driving on city streets?""  Is (likely) empirical.""When Does Life Begin?"" is not a matter of determining value. It is an objective question, although ambiguous. If we agree that the question might better be stated along the lines of ""At What Point Does A New Human Life First Exist?""- then it is a matter of fact.  It begins at conception, and that isn't a value judgment...or an opinion."	AGAINST

Let's go with that.Firstly, is it a codified right? I can't think of anywhere that such a right is stated or implied, unless you count your genetic offspring as property.Is it a natural right?

3142	abortion	"Interesting Topic.  ""Can Catholics Vote For Pro-Choice Politicians"".Fisrt Off, The only individual qualified to answer or have an opinion in such a matter should rightly be a Catholic.  For it is he/she who knows the truth of the matter.  Secondly, only a Catholic in good standing with the teachings of the Church should apply.  Well then, that pretty well narrows it down a bit.Throughout the ages mankind has fought against good and evil.  Placing both at the forefront of the battle from which gain members.To do evil is relitively easy.  To do Good on the other hand, well now, thats another story, but it's one with a happy ending I assure you.Religion has been with man from the beginning and man himself and by himself can not seem to agree when that happened either.  That's another story.For the most part, a mans religion has been a mans reason for living, for doing good deeds and for spiritual gratification.  An inner growth in sorts.  Man who becomes bored with doing good things will tend to drift toward a more distorted belief.  An inward or selfward belief.  One which promises nothing and will in the end, do much the same.  This same man or individual will challenge any and all things that block his ability to waiver from the Truth.  Much like an adolesent who so chooses to misbehave in the face of a supperior.  He'll take on the Empire State Building, making claims to substantiate his opinion and stope low in order to win his point.  A kind of sinister high, if you will.  He's taken on authority from all corners of the world and when that wasn't challenging enough, he decided to take on God.  Thinking so highly of himself, he couldn't see the forrest for the trees.  We've seen this play out before and within the Catholic Church when certain individuals decided to place themselves above God.  Most recently, this created a break in the Church with false promises to those wanting more, so called freedom from the teachings of the Church.Of course like many people do, they decided to leave and start their own church with their own way of doing things and with their own beliefs, interpreted in their own way.  Even today, within the Catholic Church, there are those who call themselves Catholic but hold their own personal views and opinions, far from the True Churchs Doctrin which has been handed down from the beginning.  The Teachings have not changed, though the people have.  It is one Teaching, that from God, which protects the Catholic Church, the one Jesus started some two thousand years ago.  Over 33,000 new and improved churchs have popped up since the 1500's and continue to promise everything but the entire Truth.  Those who wish to argue this can simply research it for themselves.  I didn't make it up, I simply am providing you an extended version of why this topic can not be debated upon as though it were an opinon for cooking pizza.  Oh it can I guess, but then you would be choosing to be on the right side or the wrong side.  So proceed with caution.  Somebodies life other than your own, might well depend on it.A Pro-Choice Politician is just another individual who wants a vote.  A True-Catholic cannot vote for an intrensic evil unless the options available provide a better result which would be supportive to Gods point of view which supports all life.  Society today has watered down Truth as to it's true meaning from years ago.  Today Truth still exist and it's a wonderful thing to have in a confused world.  Like many topics, instead of trying to dissect our world into more suitable bites, can we not simply list all that is Good and all that is Bad, like too opposing teams and let the players decide for themselves?  But then again, you would have to allow an oppertunity for the Truth to be known.  "	AGAINST

3144	abortion	There are many arguments to both sides of this issue, but I think the arguments for being pro-life are way better than the one's for being pro-choice. First of all, no matter how much you deny it, cover it up, or lie about it, abortion is killing someone. You can keep telling yourself that it isn't, but it is. That's against the law just to let you know. It is against my religion and that is one of the reasons why I think it is wrong, but I can argue from a secular point of view also. The Declaration of Independence lists three inalienable rights: LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Isn't killing an innocent baby taking all three of these rights away from it? Also, one argument for being pro-choice is that restrictions on abortion are a violation to rights of privacy, but privacy is not mentioned once in the constitution. Besides, isn't the right to life a little more important the right to privacy? If the baby itself is not causing any real danger to the mother, then she does not have the right to takes its life a way.	AGAINST

3160	abortion	You were doing so well up until here. You are being wrenchingly absolute. The issue of aborting a pregnancy involves painful issues of moral uncertainty.I propose that there is a fundamental error in your 'beginning of life' argument. You take as given that there actually exists a definitive point at which a fetus becomes human (gets rights). You appear to be saying that   abortion   before this point is fine and afterwords in an enormous crime (murder). I think this is the wrong way to view the development of a baby. What if, instead, the moral 'crime' of abortion increases continuously throughout the process of development? What if it is wrong to abort any fetus, but at the very beginning of a pregnancy it is wrong to a degree similar to that of truancy or libel and sometime later it is wrong to the same degree as accidentally causing grievous bodily injury, and somewhere near the end an abortion is truly wrong to the degree of murder? I think this progression is much more in keeping with society's view of abortion. This allows for a compassionate comparison between the medical needs and rights of a pregnant woman and the gradually increasing realization of the human potential of a fetus.My conclusions.There is no magical point in development where a fetus transitions from worthless to human.A ball of cells can not have the same rights as a post-birth baby.No abortion is as morally inconsequential as having a mole removed.

This controversy will remain for centuries, however the fact that a potential life has ended before given a chance remains evidence enough for most people to understand why a person should never have a choice of whether a baby lives or dies. There are many reasons abortion should be illegal including the descriptive and disturbing stories about how aborted babies sometime scream as they come out and the looks of pain on their faces. These facts alone should convince anyone to eliminate the idea of pregnancy termination out of their mind. The health threat to the mother after going through with the procedure as well as the lifelong health risks that remain should be good enough reasons abortion should be illegal. With the rising healthcare costs and instance of disease greater than the medical ability to solve the problems, continued health remains important to all people. Self induced problems such as voluntary termination of pregnancy leads to complications for future pregnancies, reproductive disease, and depression. Understanding that abortion is murder aids a woman in making healthy decisions for baby and mother. Though a mother may not want her baby, health for both remains and adoption remains a viable option.

3184	abortion	"I agree that personhood is the issue far more than ""when does life begin.""  My personal sense is that ""personhood"" comes at the point when a fetus would be capable of survival outside the uterus, albeit with whatever medical interventions were necessary.  Thus, the onset of ""personhood"" will fluctuate based upon existing technologies for sustain the life of the fetus outside the uterus.  Currently the limit would be somewhere between 21-23 weeks.  I suspect that this will change over the next few decades, allowing fetuses at lesser and lesser weeks of gestation to be sustained outside the uterus.  Once a fetus is capable of being sustained outside the uterus, I would consider it to have independent life, and therefore, personhood, including the right to not be terminated.  If we reach a point where an embryo of a single day's gestation can be safely removed from the uterus and brought to term entirely in vitro, then I'd say that the days of justifiable   abortion   will be at an end.  Until then, it would seem to me that a declaration of personhood would have to take into consideration the rights of the mother whose body is carrying the pregnancy.  I do not believe that any pregnancy should be terminated once it has reached a point where the fetus would be viable outside the uterus, unless the mother's life or health is at serious risk and the fetus cannot be safely removed without further risk to the mother.  If a fetus is not viable, however, including for reasons such as anencephaly, then the continuation of the pregnancy should be at the mother's discretion."	FAVOR

No one forced you to have an abortion against your will but yet you feel you are so morally superior that you have the right to make decisions regarding other women.  99.9% of them are total strangers to you.

We have thousands of children languishing in foster care, hundreds of thousands without homes living on the street or in homeless shelters because their parents don't have jobs (or don't make enough to pay rent), millions more without healthcare because their parents make too much money to qualify for state assistance but not enough to purchase health insurance.  Millions of children in this country go to bed every night hungry.  Why aren't you working your ass off to see that these problems are addressed FIRST before demanding that all women must be forced to live by YOUR moral code???

Oh, and since your side tends to be anti-birth control I'd suggest you also make sure that women of childbearing ability have all the access to that.

Both were induced with medicine, labor did not naturally occur.  Both were born attached to an umbilical cord, they were not autonomous.You are correct, cesarean births do not change the debate, they make it a stronger case that personhood has nothing to do with the birth and must exist before.If ""Exotic, borderline, or abnormal cases do not define the principle or category,"" then why can we not outlaw partial-birth abortions?

3212	abortion	"Your statement that the embryo during the first trimester is pre-human is your opinion, devoid of any religious teachings or thoughts of the rights of that fetus. The woman who becomes pregnant (in the vast majority of cases) is responsible for her condition--either because she was irresponsible about taking precautions, ignorant of what could happen when she had unprotected sex, or simply considers abortion a form of birth control. Personally, I felt protective of any of my children from the first moment I knew that I was pregnant, and I was already aware of their humanity. Another possibility is that many minor girls are forced by their parents or boyfriend to have an abortion when they don't want one. What about their rights?However, you sidestep the real problem. Many abortions are performed AFTER the first trimester--right up until the baby is viable outside the womb--including by partial-birth abortions. How any morally aware person can approve of killing infants that can feel pain and are capable of sustaining life outside the womb is incomprehensible to me. Yet millions of women do it, while at the same time many parents are courageously fighting to keep their prematurely born infants alive by the technology available today?I grant that a woman has the right to decide she doesn't want the child she was ""usually"" responsible for conceiving, but that is what adoption is for. There are untold couples who cannot have children standing in line to receive that baby. Plus, most women who decide to have an abortion never think about what physical or emotional harm that it may cause them in the future.

The Church itself long ago developed the Just War theory because it acknowledged that under certain circumstances wars might have to be fought.  Reasonable people could disagree as to when those circumstances existed, and Catholics have disagreed about the Iraq War.  However, the Church has never stated as a matter of doctrine that the War in Iraq was not a Just War.The Church, through its teaching authority, talks about a hierarchy of sins.

Don't they also depend on his mother for sustaining (just as the fetus depends on the mother on this one thing). and what about old people who can't care of themselves?How did the fetus got into the mother's womb?, Was it the holy spirit or a consequence of her acts (ok, except raping)? We could say that the inconvenience is a direct consequence of her adult decision.Since when an inconvenience (of any kind, i can think of a lot worse than just being pregnant) can justify the ""right to not be terminated"" (killing) of a human being.Humanity does not depend on where (womb, house, car), how developped or how big (embryo, foetus, baby, toadler, adult), or how dependent we are, humanity starts when the genetic code of a man and a woman unite to form a new and unique kind of the homo sapiens sapiens specie.Any voluntarily interruption at any stage of the developpement of that human is by definition a homocide.Last thought about your :""If we reach a point where an embryo of a single day's gestation can be safely removed from the uterus and brought to term entirely in vitro, then I'd say that the days of justifiable   abortion   will be at an end"" This is even scarier that what i saw in Matrix."

Does life begin in the 30th week of gestation?  I don't know...maybe.  My point is that the beginning of life cannot be defined by means of oversimplified developmental stages, like conception or birth, or by arbitrary physiological criteria like heartbeat.  Human life must be defined functionally, based on the acquisition of higher order consciousness/awareness, which are hallmarks of the human mind, and essential characteristics of human beings vs. other animals.  At this point, those concepts are strictly philosophical since science cannot even define them clearly, let alone state with certainty when they begin.  I realize this is a hot-button issue, especially in view of the deep religious views of most Americans. I also realize that it is psychologically satisfying to have simple black-and-white answers to important issues. But this does not justify sweeping, blanket pronouncements by either side in the absence of supporting facts.

The AMA says there's no consensus between   doctors  .There are spectrums of opinions ranging from At Birth, to At Conception. There's no majority. There's just..a line in a textbook.Scientifically though, it's less clear. For example, we could go to the neurologists. Neurologists are the people in charge of the study of the nervous system, and it's through them that we get the idea of what constitutes dead--ie, Brain Death.

We're not debating whether unborn human beings (persons) exist, that's already proven.  We're debating whether these beings are human or not.  You can prove whether or not they're human; I have.

3250	abortion	a description of Partial Birth Abortion from Ask.Com:Specific steps in the most commonly used partial-birth   abortion   procedure, Dilation and Extraction, are: 1. A medical professional induces a breech (feet first) delivery with forceps. 2. Legs, arms and torso of the fetus are delivered (i.e. expelled from the mother). 3. The back of the fetus' skull is punctured with a scissors-like instrument. 4. A suction device is inserted into the skull. 5. The device sunctions out the contents of the fetus' skull, causing the skull to collapse. 6. The lifeless fetus is delivered. Although, as you point out, late-term abortions are not common, they are cited by   pro-life   advocates because of their horrifying nature.  Similarly,   pro-choice   advocates constantly refer to the need to protect the right to an abortion in cases of rape or incest, even though those circumstances account for less than 1% of the abortions.There are not many   doctors   who will perform late-term abortions because it is clear to any reasonable person that you are killing a baby.  There is also a real dispute about what constitutes a threat to the life of the mother sufficient to justify such a terrible act.One of Dr. Tiller's patients recently wrote about the abortion she had at 22-weeks because she developed pre-eclempsia.  Readers then commented that pre-eclempsia can be dealt with by bed rest, so a question arose as to whether the woman had bad medical advice or whether her situation was very unusual.With regard to a threat to the   health   of the fetus, I have never understood that as being a justification for a late-term abortion.  Why not give the child a fighting chance at life, instead of killing him or her in the womb? Another one of Tiller's patients wrote on Andrew Sullivan's blog that she had the late-term abortion because a heart defect had been discovered in her son.  One of the comments on the post was from a pediatric cardiologist, who stated it was outrageous to abort a child due to a heart defect because those infants have excellent chances for survival.  If the mother saw that comment I am sure she will haunted by it for the rest of her life. 	AGAINST

Let's face it, unmarried people have impulses, desires, etc. They are going to act on it. Wouldn't you rather they have the tools to prevent pregnancy than not have them? Perhaps I should have been more specific in my example. A baby grows inside of you. So technically, it is a part of you. A part of your body. You are not obliged to see it to term if you choose not to. This is why a ban on abortion would fail. We should reduce the number of abortions because it's a very heartbreaking decision for a woman to come to. No woman comes to it lightly. When someone decides to end the life inside her, it is because she knows that it is a better choice than condemning the chiild to a lifetime of unhappiness. Some come to it because they know they cannot overcome an addiction and thus cannot bring a healthy child to term. Others because they know they cannot financially support the child. Others because they live in abusive homes that they don't want to subject a child to. Whatever the reason, it's certainly not an easy choice to make. So providing resources for these women such as education and contraception, can make a world of difference. As for your last argument, what substantiates your claim? From the University of California study on abstinence only and comprehensive sex education: Behavior research cannot make judgments about social values, but it can evaluate the success of school-based curricula at producing tangible outcomes for young people. The weight of the evidence from peer-reviewed scientific journals clearly shows that some comprehensive sex education programs can reduce behavior that puts young people at risk of HIV, STIs and unintended pregnancy, and that these programs do not promote earlier onset of sexual activity or an increased number of sexual partners among adolescents. By contrast, little if any credible research exists to substantiate the claims that abstinence-only programming leads to positive behavior change among youth.The credible research sends a clear message to policy makers: if the goal of school-based sex education is to increase positive health outcomes for youth, comprehensive (or Òabstinence- plusÓ) sex education is the proven effective choice. Abstinence-only programming runs the serious risk of leaving young people, especially those at elevated risk, uninformed and alienated.	FAVOR

Siamese twins ARE metaphysically independent. If you do not know what metaphysical means, and the prefix ""meta"" does not clue you in, that is not my problem. I can tell you it has nothing to do with umbilical cord status.You keep using an invalid approach, intrinsicism, to make your point, claiming that value resides IN this or that part (arms, fingers, heartbeats, DNA, etc.). But value is objective; it is not intrinsic to anything. You do anything and everything but look at what a fetus IS, what IT is, in its totality, its actual nature, as an entity. I cannot force you to think in rational terms, but don't expect me to say that just because you are arguing something, maybe you have a point. You don't.In fact, your argument about medical technology only STRENGTHENS my argument and weakens your own. In a Cesarean section, the doctor has determined in THAT PARTICULAR CASE that the fetus is survivable with a certain level of medical support AT THE POINT when the operation is scheduled. In other words, it is objective: The values of the mother, needs of the offspring, and medical capabilities meet at that point.Now, except in exotic, borderline, and abnormal cases, when is a fetus fully formed, capable of functioning autonomously and being metaphysically independent? At birth. Nature makes it so. The burden of proof would be on you in any particular case to prove otherwise. Can you predict when it will be ""5 seconds before birth"" for a given fetus? No? The rational, objective standard is birth.In a premature birth where the baby is kept alive with medical support, it is only alive because it is receiving medical support, which by definition a pregnant woman seeking an abortion does not want to provide to the fetus. What medical technology can do for a fetus, however, is irrelevant. What is relevant is WHAT A FETUS IS. It is absurd and atrocious to suggest that a woman should have to carry a pregnancy because if she did remove the fetus from her body and did provide medical rescue which she by definition is unwilling to provide, it will be a baby at that point. Potential beings have no rights over actual beings, not in any valid ethical or political system.And to repeat, an abortion is not a birth. In an abortion, a fetus is terminated and removed, or partially removed and terminated. Order does not matter; it is a fetus. There is no intrinsic value to ""out of the birth canal."" It happens during abortions, and it happens during births. So?I do not see how any of the other points in your post, e.g., miscarriages, relate to anything or argue for anything. But since you insist on going all the way through all possible exotic, borderline, and abnormal cases, let's go the other way and discuss how a fertilized egg is a human being entitled to individual rights, if you are as interested in getting to the truth as you claim. Still waiting for that evidence that a fertilized egg has a soul."	FAVOR

3274	abortion	"This is an issue of individual rights. However, a woman does not have the right to terminate a life, regardless of whether it is inside her body or not. The fetus also has a natural right, to life. If this is not so, then the mother does not have a natural right to life either. One cannot say one human being has more of a right to life than another. What makes this even worse is we all have a right to make our own choices. The mother who terminates her pregnancy had a host of choices that would have prevented the pregnancy, the fetus never had a choice. The fetus' choice is made for them. This is a form of tyranny, as the voiceless does not is not given a choice of freedom.Denying a woman an   abortion   is not to deny her an individual right. She does not have the right to terminate her pregnancy and destroy human life, it is a choice not a right. She has a right to make choices, choices that would have prevented the pregnancy.You are right, she is free to live as she chooses. However as Rand said, ""a private individual is legally free to take any action he pleases (so long as he does not violate the rights of others)"".Abortion is an example of the lack of individual responsibility that is being bred into our culture. We have all these rights and don't want the responsibility that comes with exercising them. When the ultimate individual responsibility we will ever have (to that of our offspring) can be neglected and the decision made which leads to this can be accepted with no recourse, our society is degenerating. Creating life (reproduction) is the ultimate gift that has been given to all living things and to demean that gift and take it for granted can do nothing but harm. Abortion is morally wrong, biologically wrong, ethically wrong, and violates all natural rights humans have been endowed with. It is truly one of the largest violation of human rights the world has ever seen and since the abortion movement (Planned Parenthood) systematically targets poor minorities, I would claim it is borderline genocide.

My frame was not hidden from You when I was made in a secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth, Your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in Your book before one of them came to be.Ó Psalm 139:13-16. God created you, He created me, and He has created everybody. Life is a gift. Nobody has a right to take away that gift. Life starts at conception. Mother Teresa said ""What is taking place in America is a war against the child É And if we accept that the mother can kill her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another."" This war against the child is abortion. If I tell a pregnant woman she can kill her baby, why can't I tell a man that it is alright to murder a three year-old. What is the difference between killing a baby nine weeks after conception and murdering a child nine weeks after birth? During the Holocaust, approximately 11 million people were killed between 1933 till 1945. These people include Jews, homosexuals, Slavics (Russians, Poles, and others), Gypsies, mentally and physically disabled, Communists, Socialists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Christians found helping the targeted people. That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers. But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers? From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed. This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust. For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.4 million babies each year. The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year. The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves. Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children. To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?  Dr. Richard Land, president of The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission,said ""We lose more babies through abortion every year than the total fatalities in all of the wars in which we have ever participated, commencing with the French and Indian War and including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War I, and Gulf War II.Ó In 2005 1.2 million abortions were performed. Even though this number is the lowest since 1974, this is still too many abortions. Every twenty seconds a child is aborted. Fifty-six percent of women who have abortions are in their twenties and sixty-one percent of women who have abortions have one or more children. According to Guttmacher Institute, the reasons women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Three-fourths of women cite concern for or responsibility to other individuals; three-fourths say they cannot afford a child; three-fourths say that having a baby would interfere with work, school or the ability to care for dependents; and half say they do not want to be a single parent or are having problems with their husband or partner. Many pro-choice posters say ÒMy Body. My Right.Ó Woman don't take into consideration that their decision to have an abortion affects not only their body, but the unborn babies. Jeremiah 1:5 says ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.Ó The Lord knew you, even before conception!  Women who have abortions are only thinking about themselves. What have they forgotten? Have not considered that this baby is a living person? Three weeks after conception a baby has a heartbeat and at four and a half months she can experience pain. By nine weeks, he has begun to develop blood vessels, eyes, lungs, ears, arms, legs, mouth, nose, the color of his eyes, fingers, toes, brain, joints, teeth, spinal cord, nervous system, and facial muscles. He can also hiccup frown, squint, turn his head, touch his face, breath (without air), stretch, and yawn. He is well proportioned, about the size of a thumb, and every organ is present. Exodus 21: 22-25 says ÒIf men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.Ó But instead of condemning women who have made this choice, we should come to them with compassion, offering them help. After a woman has an abortion, her initial response in most cases is a feeling of relief. Then, with repression and denial, she avoids the problem, usually for years Ñ5 years is common, 10 or 20 not unusual. Guilt, regret, remorse, shame, lowered self-esteem, dreams and nightmares, flash-backs, anniversary reactions, hostility toward men, crying, despair, and even suicide attempts are symptoms of Post-Abortion Syndrome. Many women turn to drugs and alcohol as a way of masking the pain. Anniversary reactions are an increase in symptoms around the time of the anniversary of the abortion, the due date of the aborted child, or both. We should also inform women who are considering abortion about the procedure and effects of abortion and other options such as adoption. Crisis Pregnancy Centers can be found in most metropolitan areas. Many Crisis Pregnancy Centers in Illinois metropolitan areas offer pregnancy tests, ultrasound services, adoption plans, parenting education, clothing rooms, and post-abortion help. According to Hope Pregnancy Ministries ninety percent of abortion-minded women choose life after seeing their ultrasound. Luke 1:42-44 says ÒIn a loud voice Elizabeth exclaimed: ""Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.Ó When Mary enters Elizabeth's house, John, an unborn baby, leaps for joy because he is in the presence of the Christ, another unborn baby. Dr. James I. Lamb, executive director of Lutherans For Life, said ÒBoth Mary and Elizabeth experienced an ÔunplannedÕ pregnancy. Both their babies were still in their wombs. Both trusted God in seemingly impossible situations."" That the Christ would become a baby shows just how sacred life is."	AGAINST

3284	abortion	Betty, your argument dismisses the fact that the unborn fetus is a separate life entity. The decision to have an   abortion   is a decision to terminate not the mother's life but the life of the fetus within. You are arguing for the right to terminate someone else's life.With that said, there are many reasons why a pregnancy should not continue. Certainly when the health of the mother is at risk is one of them. If the pregnancy is as a result of rape or incest is another. And finally, like it or not, sometimes accidents happen.The problem society has is it can't seem to understand the concept of compromise. It's always an all or nothing deal. Either we don't allow abortions at all, or we allow abortion at any stage of development for any reason. But I truly believe the answer is one of compromise. During the first trimester abortion should be universally allowed. During the third trimester abortion should only be allowed to protect the health of the baby. Abortions during the second trimester should be allowed, but should be somewhat restricted (i.e., perhaps require the father's permission, or require counseling first.. something that forces the decision to be carefully reviewed, but still allow for it).It is a slippery slope, and finding the right balance is not easy.

3299	abortion	"Let's face it: life began millions of years ago, and has continued more-or-less uninterrupted since then. Individual organisms succeed one another within the continuity of life, building on the genetic inheritance from their parents, and at some point these organisms began studying biology and philosophy and invented   religion  .A sperm is a living entity, and therefore a life form, as is an egg, and as is any cell in our body. But we prefer to think of only entire complex organisms as living entities, and individual cells as just a part of a living thing. So when we ask the question ""when does life begin?"" we're not referring to the event millions of years ago. We are not referring to the beginning of life in general, but to the beginning of a particular living organism, or person. And it's tempting to answer that a person begins to exist when a sperm and egg unite, because this is when a unique genetic combination first takes shape. But there's a problem with that notion, because it's just a single cell at that point, not a complete organism. Is there really a ""person"" there? Or just a human body cell? That rudimentary cell has no brain, no mind, no consciousness of its existence, can feel no pain or joy, and has no more claim to real personhood than any cell in my body. Except that it has the potential of developing into a person. So it's a potential person. But does that make it a person? Or just a potential future person? What is a person, anyway? Well, I know what a person is. I can distinguish a person from a dog or a hampster. I also recognize a newborn baby as a person, even though it doesn't yet speak a language I know. But a single, mindless, almost-microscopic spherical cell that has none of the attributes of a person? That's   stretching   things. I'd rather wait until it has a brain and a consciousness and an ability to feel pain and pleasure and know that it exists before I call it a person.Ah! But is it true that this single cell has no attributes of a real person? Some would argue that it has a soul, implanted by God himself, just like an adult human being! And that's what makes it different from a skin cell. That's what makes it a real human being, not just a part of a human being. It has a soul!But does it? That's a religious belief, not supported by scientific evidence. And even our concept of a soul is difficult to distinguish from our concept of our mind, except that the soul is supposed to live forever, whereas the mind dies when the brain dies. But the soul is supposed to retain all the memories of the mind, we're told, and to succeed the mind as our own identity after our body dies. Is all that true? Or could the soul really be just the mind, but with the added attribute of eternal life? Do we even know that there is eternal life? The Bible says so, but it was written by people who thought the earth was flat and the center of the universe. Oh, I forgot. God wrote the Bible by manipulating the hands of the authors. So everything in the Bible is absolute truth. Or is it? OK, let's come back to the real issue. Should we send a woman to prison because she interrupted the development of a single parasitic cell in her body that might otherwise have become a person someday? Or was it already a person? I think that depends upon whether it had a soul. If it didn't, it was just another mindless cell that might have developed into a human being some day, as might any developing egg or any sperm. And the issue of a soul is purely a religious issue. If we rely upon the unsubstantiated religious beliefs of certain people to imprison women who take command of the   health   of their own bodies by refusing to submit to the growth of an unwelcome, mindless parasitic cell and a following eighteen-year sentence of parenthood, then what kind of   society   have we become? The objection to the   abortion   of a mindless cell is based upon the purely religious speculation that that cell has a soul implanted by a god. But even if you believe in a god and a soul, how do you know when that god sticks the soul into the body? That's pure speculation. We don't send people to prison for violating speculative religious beliefs, especially if they don't personally believe them.

Children born to mothers without the means to take care of them are more likely to be abused, uneducated, unhealthy, do drugs, commit crimes, etc.  In the book Freaknomics, the authors discuss the fact that   crime   rates inexplicably plummeted about two decades after Roe vs. Wade; they argue that this is because many poor women chose to abort their children rather than have them, resulting in fewer criminals 20 years on.

I would imagine the girl would never really bond with her baby, and the child would have to grow up knowing of its conception and live with the knowledge that it was not wanted. Surely that is justification enough? That is not a life anyone would want, and surely aborting that baby in its early stages of development would be the better thing to do.Also, think of the number of children that would end up in care if abortion was banned. There are enough of them already, the banning of abortion would most definately increase this number, and the more children in care, the lower the quality would become. Where would they get the money to look after so many children? Our taxes? It would get rediculous, and there would be a lot of children out there wishing they had never been born.I do realise that there are problems with abortion, for example, the amount of people who have unsafe sex because they know they can either take the morning after pill or have an abortion is rediculous. But, I'd like to know that if the contraception i was using didn't work and I fell pregnant through no fault of my own, I would be very happy that I have the option to have an abortion. Also, when do you begin to class a fetus as a human? I personally would not think of it as a human untill about 12 weeks. It doesnt even enter the fetal stage untill the 11th week, surely abortion before this stage is not inhumane? If there was a contraception out there that was 100% effective, then this would be a more valid arguement. I'm young, and have dreams and aspirations that I could never fulfill if I became pregnant. If contraception can't garrentee that i won't get pregnant, I definately want the choice to have an abortion if i needed one.

And I suppose it would be difficult to discern who is running when you are the one running with irrationality.Oh, and I have successfully challenged what you have put forth of said 'epistemology'; the fundamental problem is that any scenario applied to a human fetus can also be applied to a human being; even a lack of reason - for that condemns the mentally retarded, even the lack of a particular ability, for it condemns the handicapped, even the issue of metaphysical independence, for you cannot prove that such is absent from a fetus - nor can you prove that you possess the same without appealing to God: which would shoot yourself in the foot.Therefore your victory is an illusion, a fantasy in your mind, though unfortunately not alone.  You have offered no evidence for your claims.  Philosophical opinions to not constitute proof; but the sciences of embryology and fetology confirm that both are existing organisms with human properties - when the offspring of humans - and therefore human beings, by definition; they also prove that said beings are alive which is important since a corpse cannot be killed.I have repeatedly squared on the issuesI have clearly defined my terms - you just don't like dictionaries because they're unbiased.I've never asked for elaboration beyond the relevant.I've always been as specific as necessary - you on the other hand, have 'spewed generalities' indirectly, at least, by assuming broad, arbitrary conditions such as 'survivability'.My logic is based on true axioms, and therefore is probably tertiarily axiomatic, but that's not even a logical flaw, quite the opposite actually.I have supported my claims - with biology: high school biology, and logic, basic logic.

Of these women, 33% had perceived themselves to be at low risk for   pregnancy  , 32% had had concerns about contraceptive methods, 26% had had unexpected sex and 1% had been forced to have sex.[9]""    The AGI is the research arm of Planned Parenthood, the world's largest   abortion   provider. So as you can see 46% of women did not use another contraceptive method while a majority of people using other contraceptive methods report having used them inconsistently. This means that a great majority of people are not using contraceptives or are using them inconsistently. Why? Because there's always abortion available as a solution.The AGI also reports that 1% had been forced to have sex.Of course   condoms   are more effective than unprotected sex. I don't say that better sexual   education   discredits abortion as a possibility.

3341	abortion	I'd like to take the time to address several tings that have been raised in this debate and clarify my argument against abortion.First, the affect this debate has on women who have had abortions. This reality has weighed heavily on my conscience. But I think a greater issue is at stake here and therefore the cost is worth it. The greater good that is being served here is the hope that abortion on demand might someday be ended and that the emotional trauma it causes to women will be ended also.The holocaust of abortion will not be ended until people see and know the reality of what it is. It has been stunning to see through the course of this debate the lengths people will go to so as to sugar coat this issue and make it appear not so bad; and actually justifiable. So my effort is to make that know as best I can. But the truth is that when women, who have had abortions, come to a correct understanding of what has happened there is real pain and real quilt; and that certainly is not to be dismissed. So for those who have had abortions I say there is a way out of the pain and quilt; true forgiveness is possible. There is only one way out and that is through the great exchange; God in Christ takes your life and He gives you His. When He died, you died and the charges against you are paid in full, the debt is canceled. Then the life of perfection He lived becomes yours; it is laid to your account. So you go from an infinity negative debt to an infinity positive righteousness. And through His resurrection you are raised to newness of life.This is only possible through repentance and faith. Confess your sins and trust God to do for you what he said He would in Christ. This faith is not a leap in the dark, like crossing your fingers. It is an active trust, like standing on solid ground; a confident expectation in the faithfulness of God.With that said I would like to clarify my argument against abortion further and answer the question should abortion be banned. But let me preface my argument with a disclaimer. I realize there is a difference between proof and persuasion. There is no argument that I can put forth that can't be disputed. There are actually people who will argue for the reality of square circles. So I put this argument forth for those who are truly open-minded; in hopes you will be persuaded.The taking of the life of an innocent human being without proper justification is murder and murder is illegal.Abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification. therefore it is murder and should be illegal	AGAINST

I did however read the comments before I posted mine and I did ""ignore"" your comment essentially because you changed the topic.  The argument is about embryos, not fetuses.  Scientifically, there is a vast difference.  After I reread all the comments (including my own) I looked for a way to edit them in order to reference yours, but I could find no edit link.I have no intention of pretending you do not exist; you believe your position as much as I believe mine.  I have every intention of creating a true debate.The argument states that an embryo is not a human (person), but it also implies that a fetus is.Everyone being on the ""same page"" proves nothing beyond agreement of opinion.I think definitions are getting mixed up here.  Life, humanity, person: are these the same thing?  I believe we must consistently define what ""personhood"" is and when it begins.  For the rest of the ""argument,"" let's use one word (human, life, ??? suggestion) as the organism that begins when it can be detected and ends when it is dead (thus fetus through adulthood).  Let's also use one word (personhood, humanity, ??? suggestion) for the status of the organism that is given value and legal protection.It appears that you have essentially said, there is no personhood É because it is not a person,"" which is not a valid statement because a word was used to define itself.  This is also not a reason, it is pure opinion.  It would be valid to say that a fetus is not a person because it does not have the qualities of a person (although I would disagree with that assertion).  Referencing another comment of yours on this argument, it is interesting to say that personhood / legal protection begins at birth.  I'm very curious of your reasons for this.I object to ""each"" womanÕs opinion being allowed to define when personhood begins.  Many women would say it begins at conception, many others say at birth.  Men are equally diverse in their opinion.  Some have even said it begins at toddlerhood.  I contend that a set of scientific facts must be allowed to make a consistent decision.  We cannot reasonably have laws that allow for double-murder when a pregnant woman is killed and at the same time declare it legal for a doctor to lethally inject a fetus.  How can both of these laws exist together?You are correct that opinions do not establish reality (fact), but they do establish laws, morals, ethics, values, rules, textbooks, politics, and culture. These things are very powerful, and real forces.  I believe we both agree that reality (fact) must rule the argument / debate / question / decision.

If you have been paying attention to national polls you'd discover that a majority of Americans support a woman's right to a legal   abortion  .Abortion does not kill ""children"" it simply stops the growth of an embryo.  Denying children access to healthcare, housing, food, parents who can make a living wage is far more a case of ""murder"" than allowing a woman the right to make her own medical decisions.  It's a privacy issue and that means what another woman does is none of your business. If you want to agree with Mother Theresa, fine (she never experianced being pregnant) but to tell others who don't share your religious beliefs what they can or can't do is morally wrong.  Remember, the Catholic church always chose the fetus over the mother.  This usually left many motherless families.  Too many times the father had to put his children into orphanages because he couldn't work and take care of them.  It would have been better to let the woman live so she could be there for her other children.  This is the same church that denied woman access to birth control so they could prevent getting pregnant.  Besides, almost half of all conceptions are spontaneously aborted in the first 6-8 weeks so if God doesn't have a problem aborting embryos why should you care what a woman, who is a stranger to you, does?  I'm sure you're not willing to pay more taxes to help support all these millions more children you so insist must be brought into this world.  I usually find that the enforced pregnancy crowd are all for protecting ""the innocent fetus"" but once it's born it then becomes ""someone else's mistake"" and ""not my responsibility"".  Yeah, let's all applaud that moral stance!What I also find interesting that the Bible says nothing regarding abortion except where if a man causes a woman to abort he has to financially compensate her for the loss of the pregnancy.  If God can be so specific about what foods we are allowed to eat, when we can have sex, and what clothes we are suppose to wear, it seems odd that ""He"" was so silent on this subject. No where in the Bible does it say that ""no woman who has conceived shalt abort her conception"".  I mean, isn't God suppose to be timeless, able to see into the future, ect., ect.,?  Yet, the subject of abortion was never addressed.  The question of abortion will never be settled.  Those of us of feel it's a medical/privacy issue would rather a woman have access to a safe, legal abortion.

Abortion, however, is not one of these things.   An innocent life is being destroyed.  While you certainly can make a good argument for   abortion   early in the pregnancy, and there is no reason to restrict birth control, once a feltus begins to kick and play, to respond to voices and sounds, to show emotion, it is a person, and it's inalienable right to life is being infringed.  Americans not only should but must insure that as long as rights and freedoms do not infringe upon the rights and feedoms of others they are protected.  Abortion, however, is not without a victim.  It does infringe upons the rights and freedoms of another.  This is why it should not be legal.  That being said, it also should not be banned.  What I would recommend happen, is that Congress makes a Constitutional Amendment defining at what point a specimen of the human race becomes a person and achieves citizenhood, and with that citizenhood Constitutional protection, with said point occuring at some point between conception and birth, probably late in the pregnancy.  After this point, termination of the child, as it would then be defined, would be classified as murder, and not abortion.  After that amendment is ratified, the policy as to whether termination of the human specimen prior to that point is legal or not should be left to the states.  In an ideal world, abortion of all kind would be illegal.  However, this is not the case, and this is the most reasonable compromise I can come up with."	FAVOR

How can it not be a human being? This isn't about religion or choice, but about science (the thing that becomes a human, is  a human) and basic right and wrong vs. convenience.  I don't have to be a woman (I'm not) or a religious nutbag (I'm not) to understand either side of this argument.  Why do so many otherwise decent people seem to think it is OK to kill another human?

3358	abortion	"Abortion rights is an important issue, and it is typically presented (as in this debate) as a complex topic involving women's right, women's health, the doctor-patient relationship, government interference, social policy, historical precedent, biblical interpretation, etc.  But in the end none of this is relevant.  The root question is ""When does life begin?"" If you believe that life begins at conception (I do not), then there can be no justification for abortion, just as there can be no justification for murder.  In this case, abortion must be illegal in ALL cases.  Ethically, exceptions cannot be made, even for cases of rape, incest, or the health of the mother just as we cannot murder one innocent person to save the life of another.  It seems to me that ""Pro-lifers"" who allow these exceptions are contradicting themselves, because there are no exceptions to rules against murder.  But if you believe that life does not begin at conception, then abortion (at least until the point at which you believe life does begin) has no ethical component, and should be legal as a matter of personal choice.  I don't know when life begins.  But I do know that it is NOT at conception, or any time soon thereafter.  For me life is not based my interpretation of when the soul inhabits the body. It is based on when consciousness begins.  And that cannot happen AT LEAST until there is a functioning brain.  No matter what anyone claims, at this point NO ONE knows when life beings.  Clearly this is a matter that has been debated for thousands of years, and on which we all have opinions (most of them strong).  But that's the point, they are OPINIONS, not facts.  Our philosophy and science have simply not come far enough to give an unambiguous answer to this question, leaving it (for most people) in the realm of faith. And since the nature of life IS a matter of opinion at this point, abortion should also remain a matter of opinion...and choice.  Much of this needs elaboration, but it's a good place to start.

These rights are basic and fundamental, among them are; LIFE, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness. Abortion should be made illegal due to it taking the fundamental right to life from a human, the fetus. The ""  pro-choice  "" argument doesn't hold water. Choice is the foundation of freedom. You have the right to choose, SO LONG AS THAT CHOICE DOES NOT VIOLATE ANOTHER'S RIGHTS. The choice of having abortion does exactly that to the fetus, it strips a human of a fundamental right and as a consequence, EVERY single other right. More importantly, pregnancy is a choice in itself. A woman has the choice to have sex, she then has the choice of using a contraceptive; furthermore, she has a choice as to which contraceptive is used. So she has many choice, however, those choices become irrelevent once life is conceived. Pro-choicers say the woman has her civil rights violated if she cannot have an abortion. What then is it called when the innocent, who doen't have a voice to defend their own inherent rights have them violated..... It's as basic as the weight of individual rights. The fetus' right to LIFE trumps the woman's 'choice' to destroy it every single time, no exceptions.

They are human cells, but I'm sure you'll agree that's saying a different thing.  A fertilized egg is a human cell too, of course, but with a difference: that single cell grows until it is indisputably a human being.  No gamete ever does.  That is why a human life begins (starts to grow into an adult human) immediately after conception.In the abortion debate, pro-choicers like to say that a fetus isn't a person, but merely a _potential_ person.  (Of course, they reserve the right to define ""person"" to themselves!)  Two gametes are a potential human if one is a sperm and the other is an egg.  If they're both sperm or both, then you don't have any potential humans.  You've just got human parts.  A chlorine atom isn't (table) salt, and neither is a sodium atom.  You need both, and you need them to bond before you have salt.  A sperm and an egg are analogous to the chlorine and the sodium.  Until you get both, you only have pieces.

Want to understand what made the crime rate drop in the 1990s? Look back to the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 - ""To discover that abortion was one of the greatest crime-lowering factors in American history is, needless to say, jarring. It feels less Darwinian than Swiftian; it calls to mind a long ago dart attributed to G. K. Chesterton: when there arenÕt enough hats to go around, the problem isnÕt solved by lopping off some heads.

It is, in essence, a ""parasite"" (by strict medical definition) upon the mother's system. It is reliant upon continued physical embedding within the mother's system to survive""My objections:The fetus didnt implanted because he decided to do so. The resposability of it's existence is it's mother's that engaged in a sexual intercourse. This is a basic difference from a parasite. The mother is not just some adult willing to take care of the child. There is a unique and beautiful connection between these two beings and it makes the case against   abortion   even more painful for this.So the only two things that the fetus needs is: food (by aid of the umbilical cord) and space (the womb). Just as babies need food (mother's milk) and a place to stay (it's mother's home). The only difference is that the babies needs can be replaced by any willing adult while before week 21-23 the baby needs can be covered by one person only:  it's mother. Isn't it sad that the one person that with her acting brought him to life and the one person who as the duty to take care of him is the one person that wants to terminate his life?"	AGAINST

The question seems to be one of teleology; what is it for, how should we use it and how do we deal with it's consequences.As we, as a culture, remove the boundaries of sexual conduct and blur the distinctions it begins to have serious consequences we don't immediately recognize. The logical out working of the sexual revolution may be missed by those who advocate for it, but it is not missed by the youth. They are looking to us as adults to clue them in on how the world works and we are sending them a clear message about sex. While we sit here and debate these issues and argue that it doesn't hurt anyone and kid ourselves into thinking we are liberating ourselves; we find our children living in fear and bondage to sexual harassment at school. Girls are primarily the target and their grades suffer because of it.The sexual revolution has liberated no one; it has only dragged thousands into bondage and slowly ate away at a once great nation. You need to really think hard about the ramifications of what you are arguing for. Because you may not see the cost but that doesn't mean there isn't one.If we as a nation are to avoid going the way of the Roman Empire we need to restore the boundaries of sexual conduct. Our streets are flooded with sexual perversion because we have removed all limitations to sexual expression. The last limitation that remains is ""age of consent"" and that is being vigorously attacked. The only safe place of expression for sex is within the context of a life long heterosexual marriage. But we have told the youth otherwise; so are we surprised by the way they conduct themselves in school among classmates of the opposite sex. We don't need to be telling kids to use a condom if they want to sexually express themselves. We should be telling them that sexual expression is only appropriate within the context of a life long heterosexual marriage. Are we so foolish as a people to think that this is the first time in history a people has moved in this direction? They indeed have and the results are always devastating.

3409	abortion	Which is the actual length of time, really.  40 weeks, in general.  I make the claim that it wrong to force a woman (by means of either allowing or disallowing action) to be imprisoned to her body for any reason.  More over, I find the claim that we must allow only medical actions that agree with nature to be preposterous considering the whole point of medical advancement has been to thwart nature.And if you find that it is acceptable to force a woman to give up her freedom for however long because it means that one life might live, you find it acceptable to say one person's life can not be free.... and this then applies to all people - including the life that freedom was tossed aside for.   Which makes little sense.If you say one person has no right to freedom because it's only for a short time, you make it allowable for every person to be enslaved to another for only a short period of time.  Freedom doesn't work that way.  Either you are free (in so far as the use of your body by others), or you are unfree.  This is one reason why Vietnam was so opposed.  Because you had thousands, literally, who were enslaved by the government.   And further to that, men like Cheney and Bush and Clinton and a host of others were able to buy their way out this enslavement.   Which speaks further to injustice. You join the military because you want to.   If you were forced into it against your will and principles of what you believe (for if you believed in the   war  , you would have enlisted), would you still hold that your life was worth less than others?  And if you hold that your life is worth less than others lives, why then should you try and force your belief upon me?  I owe my life to no one.  To be forced to owe my life to someone, even for a short period of time, means that I have no individual right.   This is the very foundation of this country... that I have the right of an individual.   I think I have said though, that if it determined that the fetus is viable - or even if the medical community is unsure but there is a possibility of it being saved, there is little difference between an   abortion   and a c-section.   If the woman does not want to give up her freedom and owe her life to a fetus, there is more than one option of abortion, at some point, that doesn't enslave the woman.  If this is the case, then it becomes the responsibility of us all to ensure that the life of the fetus IS protected.   This doesn't mean the woman must remain pregnant.... it simply means a change in procedure.   However, if this is the case - which I think it is.... it is not the woman who bears the burden of this extra cost, but the   society   that says life should be protected.    	FAVOR

Therefore, I can infer that you are against what I have said.----I can see now that we have been arguing two different questions. The question is not about whether abortions should be banned or not. I already answered that they should, with there being exceptions for special circumstances. One of those special circumstances I mentioned was rape, and you disputed me on that circumstance. That does not mean that I am against abortions being banned; I would like for that to happen. I think you got mixed up when I said that and inferred wrongly. -----Practically all Christians are against abortions, because it goes against what the Bible says. I am against them too, however I do not believe it is right to judge someone in a negative manner if they do have an abortion. The same goes for gays as well concerning harassment. You shouldn't judge someone, period. When you judge someone, it eventually leads to hate, and God will not forgive you if you do not forgive you neighbor for what they have done. People make bad decisions every day. Their (people having abortions) sin should not be ridiculed upon or emphasized as one of the worst sins, because we also commit sin, and God looks at every sin the same way, except for the one I mentioned in my previous statement. You should tell them that what they are doing is sinful and pray for them, but I don't believe you should harass them and look down upon them for what they have done.-----I am inferring that you are a Christian, although I may be wrong. Could you specify what religion you follow? I am a nondenominational evangelical.-----I get what you are saying with Romans 1:18-25, but what you fail to realize is that although a person has an abortion, that does not mean that they cannot be forgiven of it and become Christians later on. The only sin in which you cannot be forgiven is blasphemy against the HS (Mark 3:29). You should not degrade them for what they have done, but encourage them to turn to God so that He can forgive them of their past wrongdoings. -----How very judgmental of you.You took it out of context. Read the entire paragraph and you will see my response. I also put in in bold in response to your other statement.-----Anyway, since your not to familiar with what scripture teaches.Wow, and you are calling me judgmental...-----note the part were Jesus says you shall not murder. About right and wrong; notice that Jesus quoted the Ten Commandments here.Jesus condensed them into two commandments for Christians to follow. See Matthew 22:36-40. They revolve around love, not murder.-----Hmmm...so let me see here. According to the verses you mentioned, you believe that you must follow the Ten Commandments in order to have eternal life? I want to make sure I understand your point of view, because I disagree with it if it is so. Romans 10:9,10""If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.""Ephesians 2:8,9:""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from youselves, it is the gift of God--not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do""I can't go on until I know which religion you follow, but it is clear from these two verses that if you are a Christian, you are saved by faith in God, not by obeying the Ten Commandments.

Instead of addressing the question of when life begins, they choose to address a religious question -- ""When does someone receive a soul?""  Not surprisingly, they conclude that there is not a consensus answer.  Uncertainty is bliss.However, the issue of when human life begins is a scientific one.  At the moment of conception, a distinct human life is created.  An individual member of our species, with his or her own DNA, has come into existence.  That life may be cut short before birth because of miscarriage or abortion, but the life is a human one.  It is not going to be a puppy.  It is not going to be a pony.  It is going to be a baby.Evading the fact that life begins at conception may let people like Mr. O'Brien sleep better at night, but it is intellectually dishonest.

3416	abortion	You're right that there is very little difference between a full-term fetus and a newborn infant.  However, if you understood my argument as claiming anything other than this, then you misread what I wrote.  The distinction I am making is between a full-term infant (or even a pre-term infant with sufficient gestational development to survive outside the womb) vs. a fetus of insufficient gestation to allow it to survive through the independent functioning of its own bodily systems - in other words, a fetus which has not yet reached a point where it is viable outside of the uterus (with whatever medical interventions are available).  This is why I would draw the line at somewhere around 20 weeks gestation, but would prefer to see abortions, if they must be performed, take place within the first few weeks after conception.  The further the pregnancy progresses, the murkier the line becomes.  And when the point is reached where the fetus, if delivered, would have even a small chance of survival outside the uterus, I believe the line is drawn and crossed.  Any   abortion   after that point should be ONLY done if the fetus is clearly physically non-viable, such as an anencephalic fetus.  If a pregnancy must be terminated to save the life or health of the mother after the point of viability outside the uterus, and the fetus is normal and healthy, then I believe a vaginal or cesarean delivery should take place and every effort made to save the life of the pre-term infant.  Of course, this is what generally happens in such cases, anyway.  Very few mothers facing a health crisis late in pregnancy and needing to bring their pregnancy to a close would desire to lose the baby in addition.  Arguments which imply this are really quite bizarre.  	FAVOR

If it is not merely a constituent part, but  complete, and if it has the appropriate life functions, then it is a life.

Any scientist will have to admit that, and the US court system has even reviewed and verified that this is scientifically verifiable.The real position of people like O'Brien (who know better, but still say that 'it isn't clear when life begins' , because that is more marketable) is that in spite of the fact that a new human life exists at conception, they don't think that all human lives deserve rights- even the right to avoid being destroyed.  'Personhood' is a quality which supposedly is present in most humans after birth but which is never present at certain points when the life is still in utero.  Since personhood can arguably mean whatever you want it to mean, if it is necessary in order for human life to receive rights, then they can justify   abortion  .

3425	abortion	I have always been   pro-choice   and strongly believe that the decision to have an   abortion   is a strict matter between the woman and her husband or physcian. If she is single then someone she respects is fine as well.  Ultimately, its the woman, not the government, that should make the decision.  Barry Goldwater, a strong conservative, was strongly pro-choice because he thought like me, that what goes on in the bedroom, stays in the bedroom!  Today, if he tried to run as a Republican, he would be trounced in the GOP primary!  Abortion services, especially in the 3rd world, was until Bush became President, was one of many services that was sponsored by our government. Its always been interesting to me, that the very people who are so strongly against abortion, are the same ones against government-funded, pre-natal care and government-sponsored   health care   services to the poor-including   food   stamps and financial help to   kids   who have no   health insurance  ! Force the poor girl who has no way to provide for the child or was rapedto the pro-lifers, it doesn't matter-she must have that unwanted child!Over population is a major threat to our world and our standard of liv-ing!  I encourage abortion as a means of keeping the population under control-especially in 3rd and 5th world countries. Adoption, is a viable alternative and should be examined. Encouraging women who already have too large a family to support, to not have an abortion, is iimmoral and a further strain against the social welfare system in much oof the world. Keep in mind, that a lot of these poor, uneducated women, are the sole breadwinner-the husbands have deserted the family, or died of   AIDS   like in sub-Saharan Africa for example.  Why bring another child in the world to face hopeless   poverty   and misery when the woman could make an informed decision and have her pregnacy terminated.These pro-lifers in the U.S. are so disconnected to the real world-living in wealthy suburbs and   driving   SUV's-have no idea what its like ffor these poor women live day to day trying to feed and cloth their kids!

Some define personhood (qualifying for rights) through a set of criteria. A being need not exhibit every criterion to qualify as a person, but failure to exhibit most is proposed as disqualification. One list includes consciousness (at least the capacity to feel pain), reasoning, self motivation, the ability to communicate on many possible topics, and self-awareness. Lists like this are intended to help someone be able to objectively distinguish between a biological human and a person. An embryo is not a person because it satisfies only one criterion, namely consciousness (and this only after it becomes susceptible to pain). Other sets of criteria conclude that an embryo lacks personhood (and a right to life) because it lacks self-consciousness, rationality, and autonomy. These lists diverge over precisely which features confer a right to life, but tend to propose that they are developed psychological features not found in embryos."	FAVOR

So really the only safe sex is to take a vow of abstinence. For life. There is certainly question to when life begins. You say it's life throughout. What marks the beginning stage then? The question is not what kind of life. What does that even mean? And of course it's not ok to kill your neighbor. Nice try. Your neighbor is a fully grown person, and does not live inside of you for 9 months. Considering that a fetus lives inside you (and if brought to term must be raised by you for 18 years), you have a little more say over it's existence. And, to paraphrase Obama, pregnant women tend to make the best choices on whether or not they are stable enough to raise children. I agree that we should have better access to contraception. We can certainly both agree that we should minimize numbers of abortions as possible. And access to contraception would certainly cut down on abortions. Sexual education about contraception is also key. Abstinence only does not work.	FAVOR

It's a bit late to talk about her rights over that fetus' rights that late in the game. If she used contraception and it was truly a mistake, I still say she has the ultimate personal responsibility. If she wanted to be sure not to conceive, use 2 forms of contraception, abstain...whatever it takes. Why should I, as part of the collective, be responsible for her whims? Or her lack of personal responsibility.

3451	abortion	It looks like we agree that the emotion of the mother does not change whether the act of   abortion   is right or wrong. Also, just to clarify, when I said that a mother's grief is illogical, I should have said that it is without logic, that is, based on emotion. There may be cases where the mother considers what might have come of the child, but when we're talking about a situation where the mother believes she made the appropriate decision but still feels grief, I would venture to say that most of the grief does not stem from a logical place. I might be making this more confusing, but perhaps it is clearer to simply say that someone can grieve both logically and emotionally at the same time, and the emotion may result from logical and illogical bases.Now on to the other interesting points you bring up. The first is sleep. This is indeed the sort of discussion I think we all should be having. If it is wrong to kill someone who is asleep, and our value of a person is not based on potential, why is it wrong. The first reason is that the person is conscious prior to going to sleep, and must go to sleep in order to sustain consciousness and health in the long term. Additionally, since we all must sleep, if you want to not be killed while asleep then you should not kill someone else who is asleep. A fetus has no conception of any of this, does not think, and cannot make any decisions. An additional reason I would say a live person has more value is that they have accumulated experience in their life that has value in many ways, both personally and to other people (friends, product of their work(s), etc).I would say that a person with advanced Alzheimer's Disease has less value than someone who does not have the disease, all else being equal. I do not believe that makes it ok to kill that person. It would impact a decision such as who's life I would save if I had to make a choice. I also think these terms extend to animals. Essentially, I value an entity's combination of types and amounts of cognitive abilities along with experience, potential, and the value others place on that entity. So to me, an unborn child has no value other than that the parents place on it when first conceived, up to some amount less than the value of the mother up to and even past birth.I welcome questions about what I've laid out as well as challenges.

In the case that the mothers life is endangered, it should be the case that the attending physician should make every attempt and exhaust every means possible to save the life of mother and child, Abortion should never be considered as an easy out, quick fix or money saving option, But if it comes down to it, I think every mother would lay down their lives for their children, it's the most humane thing to do and the most loving; to lay down your life on behalf of someone else. So even in this case I would still maintain that it should not be an option and I think it would be hard to give an adequate reason why the child's life should be taken and not the mothers. I think this maintains the sanctity of the child's life throughout and at this point the moral dilemma moves from the child into other areas.

Yes, some will fail. But better to loose a 100 than 10000. And the converse is also true. Set a low standard and kids will meet it. That's because they are looking to adults for guidance.

That was fifty years ago and today Hitler and the Nazis are known as criminals and mass murderers. But why are the doctors who perform abortions not called criminals or mass murderers? From 1973 to 2005, over 46 million abortions have been performed. This is much higher death rate than from the Holocaust. For abortion the approximate death rate is 1.4 million babies each year. The approximate death rate for the Holocaust, however, is about 917 thousand people a year. The Nazis targeted the people they did because they believed they were inferior to themselves. Women who have abortions kill their babies because they believe that they are superior to these children. To this day, Germans have collective shame because of what the Nazis did, even though they did nothing to help. In fifty years will Americans have collective shame because so many abortions were performed? Will Americans be known as mass murderers and criminals?The subject of abortion and the Holocaust are very closely related subjects. The Jews were killed because they were unwanted and inconvenient.

A physician pulling a fetus out of the birth canal does not constitute a birth.In actual childbirth, the laws of nature induce a biological process which expels an organism fully developed to function autonomously - in a metaphysical sense.Exotic, borderline, or abnormal cases do not define the principle or category. The existence of Cesarean births does not in any way change the debate.	FAVOR

Animals do not have rights because they cannot reason; they must be dealt with by force.The fact that some yahoo somewhere decides to pass a law protecting dogs and fetuses does not suddenly mean that animals and fetuses are rationally entitled to rights; it simply means that irrationality has taken hold in that yahoo's district.A fetus becomes a person at birth. That would be real birth, not what evangelicals arbitrarily redefine as birth. An abortion is not a birth.No one is simply dismissing anything. Reason is clear on this: A fetus is not a person.

To say that one way of thought is better than another alienates entire spectrums of beliefs. More importantly, it is completely un-American to take away the right to choose from over half of the American population based on the opinions of less than 1/3 of the population. I say 1/3 because that seems to be the usual percentage of Americans in agreement with the proposed initiative.We need to stop thinking of only ourselves and our beliefs and begin to consider the effect that proposing such a ban would cause. This is not simply pro-life vs. pro-choice.

3495	abortion	"Abortion should be legal. The government should never have the right to make decisions pertaining to one's own body and/or a decision to bring a child into the world or not. It takes the moral responsibility to do what is right away from the individual and this would cause us to become more and more conditioned to behave in whatever ways the establishment chooses to mold us. It would contradict the very core of what it means to be free.If we make abortion illegal, shouldn't we also make adoption? In case you don't know, the business of adoption is in the billions per year. Making abortion illegal would bolster this industry even further, and allow desperate people to become ""baby merchants"", for profit. An example would be a girlfriend of mine who needed money and decided to sell her eggs. What moral ground does that hold? Not to mention the financial burden more children would put on the American people in light of high inflation and low wages, health care costs, education etc. Forcing you to keep a child could very well sink many families into poverty. To me, the person undertaking an abortion has enough to deal with that they don't need my opinion on their moral character on top of it. They don't need my judgement because they're the ones having to live with that decision. And of course legal abortion would come with regulations to protect it from abuse. I think there's a lot that can be done to provide people the freedom of choice without allowing them to abuse that freedom, just like many other things in this country. If we make abortion illegal, adoption agencies might start to look like dog pounds.I think we need to believe that the majority of people in this country, and around the world, are good people seeking nothing more than the best chance at living a healthy and happy life. We are not all predisposed to moral corruption, poor decision making and ignorance. If we want to prosper as a nation we have to believe in our fellow man and that he will do what's right, however, that faith will not come without regulations to protect the system from those of us that would abuse it."

3502	abortion	"""becomes human"" = ""gets rights""   (?!?)Let's try an analogy: Suppose I asked, when does life begin... for butterflies and moths?1>Female lays egg2>Fertilization of the egg3>Egg hatches4>Larva's first moulting5>Wing disks develop6>Chrysalis forms7>Adult emergesI can't see where it would make any sense to argue for step #1.  The cell is haploid and (I believe) cannot (without fertilization) grow or metabolize.  One could argue for #'s 3-7, I suppose, but to what end?  If you start talking about gradually becoming a lepidopteran (or 'fully lepidopteran' or a 'lepidopteran being') despite being lepidopteran life, then you just seem goofy.  You can argue that the ordinary referents to 'moth' and 'butterfly' are the adults, but that doesn't have anything to do with the fact that from a scientific point of view, the term should be applied not merely to the adults.Maybe you already disagree.  If you don't, then consider that (IMO) the only reason to advocate for #'s 3-7 as when life begins for a butterfly or moth is that there is a concern regarding value or emphasis being given to one portion of the life cycle.  For obvious reasons this happens when the question is put to ordinary people about human life.  Ordinary people are not trying to limit themselves to empirically based determinations.  Scientists (qua scientists) are required to do just that.  They have every right to assess value, as ordinary people, but not from the standpoint of ""doing science"".  Value and emphasis (and especially the attribution of rights) are normative and arguably subjective.  Science is supposed to be empirical and objective.This business about human life with the potential to be fully human or to be a human being seems from my POV to be strictly applicable to one species.  If that is so- then how is it justified as being something other than normative and non-scientific?"	AGAINST

This. THIS is the freedom that i am speak of.  the ultimate right of choice over one's own body.  OWN body. not that of others.   it is the right for which you have said you are willing to die for to ensure that is possible for others.  that is your choice.   if you had that choice made for you - as the drafted boy-soldiers of vietnam had it made for them - it wouldn't be free, would it? in fact, if you were drafted into the army, mr. richardson, you would be enslaved to your own country.   this is an issue of freedom, yes.but this isn't JUST about ""reproductive"" freedom, mr. richardson.  it is the freedom of the whole woman.    if you ban   abortion  , you reduce women down to merely their wombs and what they can do and define the woman as merely that:  a reproductive organ housed in skin and bone and muscle topped off with a useless brain.   the woman's woman parts are greater than the sum of her whole is what you then say.  i say: would you feel the same way if it were you? would you say: I I, say the I with feeling!!!I am worth less than my womb.    (ARE you worth less then one part of you? Is your freedom?)I am less than my womb.I have no right to do as I please [with my body] for the sake of my womb because nature has designated my womb to be the carrier.  how does that make you feel to know that you are worth less than a single part of you?...... mr. richardson, i never said you said abortion was unnatural. i mentioned nature and   medical science   because you did say it's merely nature that designs a woman to carry the child.   you say the child has no choice.   did i choose to be a woman? did you choose to be a man?   we had no choice in our sex.   i have a choice to not bear a child, though.  that is the freedom i have over my body, though i chose not the form.  it doesn't matter intent of lack of intent or accident or design of nature when a fetus is inside the womb....  if MY freedom is at stake... I have a right to keep it. my body IS my choice.  again. see the last paragraph.  because there are choices in the choice..... abortion is one until the life of the growing fetus outweighs the demands of freedom of the mother.  but that doesn't mean you can simply allow the enslavement of one individual to another.  it means that the medical community that has provided women with a safe means to something women have been doing for thousands of years must provide an alternative.  that's all.     there needn't be a catch-22.... there doesn't have to be a dead man in your tent, so to speak.you're the only person i feel like i can actually speak with about this subject (who doesnÕt just agree with me). so, you know... if you're still thinking i'm saying you're saying things you're not. well then, just tell me.  i do sometimes read things wrong.   i'm not fucking perfect."

If the collective wishes to impose its will that this independent and separate life survive despite the mother's personal choices - i.e., her values, it falls to the collective to take responsibility for that life to remain consistent in its collective beliefs.In the belief the fetus has rights and ought to have liberties, you cannot ignore the fact the mother has rights and liberties too. To deny the rights and liberties of the mother is to, in effect, contradict your belief a fetus has the same because it falls into the collective definition of ""person"". In light of the ""collective will"" in situations where a pregnant woman wishes to end her pregnancy, the only possible fairness to mother and fetus is to allow the fetus and the mother to go their separate ways allowing each to survive as best each is able on their own. The collective - no matter how large - cannot have the right to hold the mother hostage to the survival of the fetus by compelling her to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, particularly if the argument is said fetus is a human being technically equal to the mother. The rights of one human being do not include the right to deny the rights of another. In that case, if one insists the fetus is a ""person"", neither said fetus nor those who wish to stand in unity with said fetus can insist the mother remain as incubator.If a ""fetus"" is, in fact, a person, let that fetus fend for itself. It has no claim to the body of the mother - if you wish to maintain the mother has no claim on the fetus. If, instead, you change your position to claim a mother has legitimate claim on the fetus within her womb, that changes everything. In such case, the mother has the right to abort at a time and place of her choosing.The collective - no matter how large in number - has no legitimate claim to the body of an individual woman or to the bodies of all women. Neither individual nor collective rights extend far. They cannot because the source of individual rights are an individual life. The source of collective rights are the individual rights of its members and ONLY of its specific members.

3509	abortion	"I have read your responses in various places. Thank you for being so thoughtful regarding this subject. If the question was precisely defined we might come to terms. They talk about the issue of   abortion   and then ask a nonsensical question, which needs to be interpreted in a context before it can be answered. My various posts, which you have responded to, have been themselves responses. The context has varied somewhat between philosophical, scientific, and legal.The theme to my thoughts is that I deny that there is a singularly important event in the life cycle of humans. We are Homo sapiens at every point and alive at every point. The parts of us that are new and unique appear at several different places in the cycle.In moral terms, I argue that it is morally wrong to purposefully destroy a fetus at any stage. However, I deny that a fetus is equal at every stage. The wrongness increases as we acquire the parts that make us unique, complex, and eventually sentient.If I was arguing for conception as THE start, I would begin with a nasty question: What is the first stage of human development called, and when does that stage begin? Many people will answer zygote and you will have them. However, the correct answer is gamete - beginning at meiosis. We have a brief haploid period in our life cycle, which occurs at the very beginning of human reproduction. Gametes are as independent from their parent as a fetus is, so there is still the question about whether they are really distinct or just a part of the parent. Random events in meiosis lead to a unique genetic make up for each gamete. Another random event (which egg and sperm join) leads to a zygote with a unique make up. Zygote is the first diploid stage. So, if the question at the top was, ""When does the first diploid stage of human life begin?"" the answer would be, at conception. Aside: Now I could be belligerent and mention that when a human begins to burn resources on reproductive structures that is really the beginning - the point where a human starts preparing the next generation. This illustrates the nature of a cycle, there is always something before.This discussion of beginnings simply does not help with the broader question of abortion. The ideologues on both sides of the abortion issue want an answer that leads to a legal result. They both want to create the binary situation that I argue against - the worthless/important dichotomy as you aptly describe it. In the absence of people trying to make this dichotomy you and I would never have had this discussion. The minor distinctions between being a sperm with the potential to be human and simply being a live human would be an esoteric subject."	FAVOR

3512	abortion	Late-term abortion is something that should be avoided at all costs, and I've been hearing a lot about it lately, mainly from people who were told that they should have one by doctors because their children may have down's syndrome (everyone that was told this didn't have further testing done because of the risk of killing the child (50% chance), and all were born and found to be healthy).It's something that should be taken care of before the child develops, but if it comes down to deciding later, it should still be up to the parents who created the child... It's sad, yes, but it's not our responsibility to decide who has to have children and who doesn't. Not everyone is happily married and ready, mentally, physically, or finically, to have children when they become pregnant, and we don't have the resources and in most respects, the right, to decide for people.

It doesn't matter if there is a life living inside that woman, that is the woman's body.  Either she has the right to govern her own body or she does not.If the fetus can sustain its own life outside of the uterus - or science can advance itself to the point where this is possible there would be no debate.  As it stands, when you support the government's right to tell a woman what to do with her body because it ""saves a life"" you should be just as much in favor of the government forcing you give away one of your kidneys, or to undergo the painful process of bone marrow transplant even if you object. That there is a life involved in an abortion doesn't resolve the fact that this is a person's body that you are allowing government discretion over.  There is no compromise.  Either you have control over your body parts and what is done with them or you do not.  If a woman no longer wishes to host a life that is parasitic in nature and that life can survive outside the womb the medical community can help it survive.But then what?In this right to life that is supported, what kind of life are you supporting? If you are going to vote in favor of forcing women to do your bidding with her body, are you going to vote in support of using tax-payer money to support all the lives you are ""saving""?  Are you then going to vote that couples must adopt before trying to conceive through non-conventional methods (I.V.F.)?  Or should the woman then be forced to care for the child herself?  Should she be compensated for the pain and suffering that was forced upon her in the form of not only childbirth, but the physical ailments that accompany pregnancy?   Ultimately, you have to decide which is more important - your right to your body or the right for someone else to live.If you say the individual's right to his or her body is greater than the right of someone else to live, you cannot vote in favor of repealing Row/Wade.  If you say the individual has no right to his or her body when another's life is at stake, you should already have given away a kidney and donated your bone marrow for as many times as you're matched.  If you can prevent a person from dying and yet you do nothing, are you then murdering that person?.  How many people have you killed from your refusal to share your body? How many lives have I let die from my decisions to keep my kidney and my bone marrow? That some women choose to keep their uterus' (uteri?) intact through abortion isn't a separate issue. You're arguing in favor of forced sharing of body in order to save lives, so I had to ask. So which is it? Do you support the right to govern your own body?  Are you willing to be told what to do with any part of your body that can save a life?  That's the real issue. "	FAVOR

3523	abortion	So the right to kill a human being is a human right?  Great!  When does hunting season open?  [Please forgive the sarcasm of the previous question].However, one could use similar language in talking about a man's right to choose; that is, 'Only when [men] are able to control their reproductive capacity can they achieve true equality in society.'Of course, 'reproductive capacity,' and 'control,' are kind of vague; possibly meaning anything from abstinence to 'slaughter of children,' to 'wanton rape.'

3524	abortion	First of all, no one's saying abortion isn't killing someone, so please stop that scarecrow argument.The pro-choice argument is that aborting a fetus is justified in certain circumstances (health risks, rape, incest). Even in cases where the mother is simply unprepared to raise a child, I'd still argue abortion should be an option, since not all unwanted babies are adopted, and end up getting screwed up in the foster system.Ultimately, the pregnacy effects the pregnant woman infinitely more than it effects you or me, so it's logical that the woman is in the best position to make the choice about what she wants to do. I personally hope it isn't abortion, but it's not our call.	FAVOR

The other types of dependence are worse than irrelevant: Every living thing is biologically interdependent.An embryo or fetus is what it is. No one denies the facts that I have stated about their nature. What is denied is their significance, in order to make room for a religious interpretation. There is no escaping it: Either reason or religion must be used to answer this question. And religion is not a valid basis for government.

3530	abortion	Well we've covered a lot of ground. Let me see if I can tie it all together for you; knowing that there is a difference between proof and persuasion.What do abortion, premarital sex, homosexuality, pornography(including soft porn, the kind found in supermarket checkout lanes) and Ted Bundy all have in common? What is the one unifying thread that ties them all together? They all devalue human life by reducing it to something less than what it is. You agree that man has a nature and it is fixed. Therefore there is a way in which mankind ought to function. A deviation from that norm is therefore dehumanizing. Let me explain.Abortion; Renders the human a non-human and therefore it can be disposed of when an individual doesn't want it.Premarital sex: views other people as objects to be used for ones own personal pleasure and then discarded when no longer wanted.Homosexuality: An expression of self love. Using another person to express ones love of self and then discarding that person when they no longer please you. Pornography: The portrayal of people as objects of sexual fulfillment. People are viewed as objects to be used for personal pleasure and then discarded when you are done with them. Soft porn: does the same as pornography but in a more subtle form; very deceiving since it appears harmless.Ted Bundy; Became convinced through pornography that people were something that you used to bring pleasure to yourself and then disposed of . Do you see the pattern. reduce the person to an object to be used, use the person and then discard them. At the core of everyone of these is love of self. Use other people to get what I want and when I'm done with them I move on.Does the idea of using people like objects bother you at all? It does me. That's why I oppose all these things.Final thoughts:football does have morality as do all sports, it's called the rules of the game. There's a way you play that makes it football and a way that makes it no longer football.Pragmatism is is a poor method for law since it has no way of telling what the good is. Also do a word study on the etymology of the word ethic and tell me what you come up with. Because I may be mistaken but I thought ethics (ethos) were fixed standards and morality (mores)were changing standards.Giving ones self over to passion is to be ruled by passion and no longer reason; that's bondage to be controlled by your emotions and not your mind. If homosexuals don't choose to be that way, why then can so many walk away from that lifestyle and never go back. Their high suicide rate is because of people like you who tell them they can't change when they really want to. That leads to depression and eventually suicide. That's not a very loving thing to do.On moral relativism; if that's true then it's just your personal preference and why should I like what you do. About legislation: what else do you base law on other than what you believe to be right. But why is it OK to base them on your morals and not mine?I think the state should remain neutral on sex ed. After all it is the parents responsibility, not the states. Because when the state does it, they are pushing their morality on others who don't agree with it and using my money to do it. And that is wrong.About Abortion legislation, which this debate is all about. The state has already ruled on this issue, murder is illegal and should be. Roe vs Wade simply stripped a whole class of people protection under that law and denied them rights we all enjoy. So again the question on abortion is; what is it? If it's not human, no justification is necessary. If it is human than no justification is adequate. So I say, it ain't a chicken. Humans produce humans. Therefore no reason you gave for abortion is adequate.Also I like the idea of your debate; I'll be sure to weigh in on it when I get a chance.	AGAINST
3531	abortion	I would just like to add one more thing. Everyone who is for abortion seems to insist this should solely be the woman's decision. Why is that? What about the father? Why should he have no say in a child that he would have to bear legal responsibility to if it were born?Suppose, a father says he does not want the child and she has it anyway. He is still legally liable to this child. Now, suppose the opposite. He wants the child, is willing to raise this child without any financial support from the mother and is willing to bear all financial burden of the mother while she is unable to work. He should not have this right?	AGAINST

3535	abortion	The only comment I will make is about the use of Exodus 21:22-25. Read the full three verses:If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.Notice the use of grammar here. If NO MISCHIEF follows the premature birth, the man is to pay a fine of whatever the husband wants. However, if there is any mischief that follows the premature birth, the person who caused it is to repay eye for eye, tooth for tooth, right down to life for life. God considers that MURDER before the child is born. In fact, eye for an eye is a legal punishment for any adult injuring any other adult willfully. So here God is giving the unborn child the same rights as any adult would have under the Law.Please, next time you try to use the Scriptures make sure you keep your use within the context of the passage. When God was giving Moses these instructions He used specific language and didn't include a penalty for hurting the mother in these verses, it all revolves around the unborn child.	AGAINST

3546	abortion	Sylvia,So are you suggesting that cats, rats, birds and dolphins do not think?  You ought to be more careful as itÕs a scientific fact that these animals all do think, and in the case of dolphins, might very well think more than humans do.Your argument is defining the differences between a Ôhuman personÕ and a Ôhuman beingÕ. A human person is a human being that is now interacting with its environment. It has a name, a personality, behavioral patterns, likes and dislikes, skills, etc. A human person is one you can touch and see and feel. A human being is a human person who hasnÕt yet had the chance to establish themselves. It is a biological entity that has yet to develop into a 'person'. Physiologically speaking, there is no difference. Placing a fetus in an environment that gives it more external stimulation to respond to does not make it any more human than if it stayed in the womb. By your definition, if a doctor removes a 28 week old fetus from the womb and places it in a nursery it is now a human. However, if a baby is born naturally and immediately placed inside an empty, dark, windowless room it is still not human as itÕs not interacting, learning and evolving from its environment. ThatÕs just silly. A fetus can not control the environment itÕs in nor should it be judged human or not by itÕs location. An unborn fetus has just as much ability to learn and interpret from its environment as one that has been born; they just reside in different environments.Regardless of whether we will agree on this point or not, if you read at the link I provided you will see that fetuses in the womb are in fact very active and reacting to their surroundings. They respond to touch, to sound and even to light. They are human beings who just happen to be living in the protective cover of their motherÕs womb, but whether in the womb or out, they are physically the same.You asked: ÒAre you saying that if a fetus is terminated before 21 weeks, that's okay. You know it won't do great things. But if it's terminated after 21 weeks, then you know that one is killing something that might do great things?ÓI use 21 weeks as a reference because thatÕs the point in a fetusÕs development that it begins to stand a chance of surviving outside the womb. My position, as stated from the start, is one of compromise; a woman should have the right to decide whether she wants to be pregnant or not and be able to terminate the pregnancy if thatÕs her choice. However, at some point the embryo/fetus developing inside her reaches a point where they are considered viable, and from that point forward I prefer to protect their right to live. I would prefer never having to take a life, so no, itÕs not okay with me to abort fetuses less than 21 weeks. However, I do understand the need for allowing abortions, hence a solution based on compromise. But just remember, every great human who has ever lived was, at some point and time, a fetus less than 21 weeks into development. You prefer to frame   abortion   as nothing more than a womanÕs individual rights but in doing so you trivialize the human life growing within her. ItÕs obvious to me that this is why so many people who favor unrestricted abortion rights spend so much time arguing that the unborn fetus isnÕt a human life. However, by all scientific definitions it is a human life and at some point its right to live should supersede a womanÕs right to abort it.You wrote: ÒAbortion should be legal because it acknowledges and affirms a woman's individual rights.Ó But what youÕre really saying is ÒAbortion should be legal because it acknowledges and affirms a woman's individual rights, including the right to kill another human beingÓ.

3547	abortion	I would rather lose a handful of women occasionally through botched abortions than sacrifice on average 1500 children daily to save those women.  If perfection is your standard for law then you are correct, however laws were meant to restrain. And prior to Roe vs Wade the law against abortion did that quite well, perfection? No. Made it rare? most certainly. And what happened after Roe vs Wade? abortions went through the roof. Laws are meant to keep us from killing ourselves off but Roe vs Wade does the opposite. it sanctions it. Consider Europe, within a hundred years, if not sooner, Europeans will cease to exist as a unique people group. Why? Zero Population growth. They're not reproducing and when they do, they kill it. Europe will be a Muslim nation within our lifetime, Why? They're having families. So please tell me why we should follow the Europeans into extinction?	AGAINST
3548	abortion	As I reread my own comment, I did realize that that seemed a bit off, even before I read yours, which pointed it out.  I think the clarification needs to be made with consciousness.  If someone willingly risks their life for freedom, and does in fact lose it, he or she has made the choice to sacrifice their life for freedom.  If someone chooses to oppose freedom, and strives to take it from another, it is within the rights of those whose freedom is being taken to take his of her life in defense of their own freedom.  A fetus, however, is created, in the vast majority of cases, by the actions of its   parents  .  Nature has chosen the mother to bear the biological burden of childbearing. (except in the case of seahorses, but I digress)  A fetus does not intentionally limit a woman's rights, nor does it seek to limit her freedom.  Unfortunately,   evolution   has made the fetus dependant on the mother.  What must also be taken into account is the amount of liberty being taken.  Conquest by fascists would be an incredible violation of freedom.  Freedom to work, live, move about freely, all of the Bill of Rights, national sovereignty, all would be utterly and permanently destroyed.  Bearing a child requires giving up some of the freedom to one's own body for a mere nine months.  The taking of one being's life, who has done nothing to warrant its destruction except for being formed as a side effect of it's parents' actions, for the sake of that small liberty cannot be justified.Of course, what immediately comes to mind is collateral damage.  The loss of innocent life as a result of   war   is horrifying, and should act to deter nations from unnecessary fighting.  It is however, a fact of war, and if a war must be fought, every step should be taken to minimize it.  That being said, one cannot fail to do what is necessary for fear of the negative consequences.  Chemotherapy is horrifying, but it is better than the alternative.  Collateral damage differs from   abortion   in that abortion in several ways.  The first is in the degree of the freedoms at stake, which have been mentioned above.  The second is intent.  Killing a fetus in cold blood is different from killing a civilian in a warzone on accident.  In civilian courts, it is the diffence between   murder   and manslaughter, in a military court, it is the difference between an accident and a war   crime  .  Collateral damage wil happen so long as there is war.  That is an excellent reason to try for peace, but unfortunately violent measures must sometimes be employed in the defense of both life and liberty.  Abortion, on the other hand, is necessary only to preserve the rights of a woman to her body for a very short period of time.  In cases where two people's rights collide, one must look both at the difference in severity of the rights in question, and at who has the greater claim.  I would argue that a fetus has greater right to life than a woman has to her body, and a nation has a greater right to life and all liberty than the soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen who sacrifice both for it, than the enemy combatant who emperils both to end it, and the innocent civilian who was simply in the ewrong place at the wrong time.

How can one make sense of that? I posit that one cannot.""a single cell that, more likely than not, possess errors that will prevent it from becoming a complete organism""Such a cell might not develop into an adult. A lot of genetic anomalies prevent reaching adulthood. If one is present in an infant, that wouldn't be a basis for denying the infant is human, which brings us right back to where we started.""where the fertilized egg has no defects it is not a complete human - the hardest, most miraculous parts of becoming a complete human organism are still to come.""First a question: You used the term 'miraculous'. I won't make a silly objection about its being non-scientific. Would you permit me to use the term 'created' in a secular sense? As in, "" at this point a new life is created.""Secondly, you contend that something isn't completely human until some point well after the organism's life cycle has begun. How can you argue that a zygote or an embryo or a fetus (human or not) is not a living member of it's species? If we were talking about gametes, then I'd agree. They require other cells to make a complete human. Are you using ""complete"" in another sense?If you're using the term ""human"" as synonymous with ""person"", then you're not making a scientific observation. Are you using it to mean ""mature"" or maybe ""independent""? If so, you are employing an arbitrary distinction.

I know of two cases where there are scientific disputes about when something qualifies as being alive. The first (things like viruses and prions), I mentioned before. The second is a seed. A seed is an embryo which can go dormant. That raises an interesting question: ""if it is dormant, then is it living?"" I'm not sure that there is an accepted answer. Humans (as far as I know) don't become dormant.""organismal biologists, ecologists, etc.) use a definition that includes ""independent"" when counting the members of a species""I must admit that I've never heard of 'organismal biology'.

""Which of these three cars is best... at saving gas for driving on city streets?"" Is (likely) empirical.""When Does Life Begin?"" is not a matter of determining value. It is an objective question, although ambiguous.

3556	abortion	"I appreciate your feedback and do apologize that this thread hasn't yet satisfied your question.  Therefore, I shall here try to simplify the ojective argument.  The cell is the basic/fundamental unit of life.  Human DNA is unique to human beings.  An organism whose somatic (non-reproductive) cells contain the full human genome is therefore a human being.  A person is defined as a human being, therefore any human being is a person.  A person may be alive or dead as a human being may be alive or dead.  This seems to be important as many wish to interperet the law only for ""persons"".  A living person thus is entitled to those fundamental rights belonging to any other living person, in this case, life.  Since life begins at conception, and the cell at conception of human offspring contains the entire human genome, and makes up the entirety of an organism (as opposed to a sperm cell - incomplete DNA - or a hair - incomplete/non-living organism), it constitutes a human being, and therefore, by definition, a person, who therefore, from conception, as per the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America (this site seems to be restrictive to U.S. policy), is entitled to 'certain unalienable rights among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (in that order).'I sincerely hope this satisfies; it's refreshing to see someone who seems truly open-minded about the matter."

3564	abortion	"All abortions no matter when they occur are very sad affairs. It is really sad when circumstances have come together such that a life must be ended or stopped from coming to fruition. Abortions are very emotionally trying to mothers and their families. That said, abortions are completely and absolutely necessary even late term abortions. I am going to argue this from a few angles.If a woman wants to terminate her pregnancy bad enough, she will do so regardless of whether she has to go to a clinic or get one from an unlicensed back alley ""doctor"" or perform one herself. Before Roe v. Wade thousands of women died every year from complications from these abortions. By allowing abortions and late-term abortions to be legal, we allow women to go through safe and regulated channels to do something they are going to do anyway to be frank.There are many circumstances in which late-term abortions are quite necessary, but I'll just name a few common situations. Often when young girls are raped, they will not tell anyone because they are afraid or a multitude of other reasons. Sometimes no one knows these girls are pregnant until they start getting big in their third trimester. These girls never got a chance to abort the rape-child in the ""proper"" time window because they are too afraid or immature to tell anyone or they don't even understand what pregnancy or sex is. Is it really fair to force an 11 year old girl to give birth to the child of her rapist because she didn't want to tell anyone she was raped?Another situation is sometimes mothers are diagnosed with cancer late in their pregnancies beyond the date of normal abortions. These women often need chemotherapy or radiation therapy. This is an excerpt from the abstract of a paper by the Department of Radiology at the University of Iowa College of Medicine""Malignant disease requiring radiation therapy during pregnancy presents an enormous challenge for the clinician. The optimal radiotherapeutic management of the patient and the optimal management of the pregnancy involve directly opposing demands. Ionizing radiation should be avoided during pregnancy whenever possible. Doses in excess of 0.1 Gy (10 rad) delivered during gestation have been associated with various detrimental effects, and therapeutic abortion has been recommended.""Often the cancer is so fast spreading that to wait the duration of the pregnancy to administer treatment that will most likely kill or maim the fetus is very dangerous and possibly fatal for the mother. In these situations the most humane thing to do is to terminate the pregnancy and treat the mother.My last hypothetical is that sometimes it is not apparent until late in the pregnancy that the baby has life-threatening deformities that threaten the mother as well. Is it really fair to tell a mother she must risk her life to give birth to baby that will or likely will die?As you can see there are multitude of possible situations in which a late-term abortion is the best option. There are such diverse situations that can occur and they are so sensitive and dependent on context, that this is not an issue that is done proper service by a blanket rule by politicians. These decisions are best left up to doctors and their patients. Women who want late-term abortions should ask their doctors and if their doctors agree that a late-term abortion is the best medical option, they should seek the approval of other doctors. Furthermore all of these decisions should be overseen by a governing board of doctors.Late-term abortions are not used because mothers changed their mind or procrastinated and this is not the intended use. Like I said the decision should be up to the discretion of doctors to determine the necessity of the procedure."	FAVOR

All three have the same thing in common, people thought the lives of the innoncent were not worth saving.  Parents went around saying I would never own a slave, but they can own all they want, or I would never kill those people but they country can kill all they want.  We just have to see how hard medical   science   is fighting to come up with birth control for men, the day after pill, and so many other birth control methods to realize that they know a fetus which means ""Little One"" is a baby.  We also know that many, many people suffer after having an abortion, men and women.  What makes all the folks who look the other way any better than the folse who looked the other way with child abuse, be it a bishop, teacher, political party, family member or friend.  Why can Planned Parenthood not report a rape, or when a fivteen year old teenager has had sex with a man over the age of twenty-one.  Do all these people who support abortion really believe they are doing the right thing?  Hasn't history proved that many of these people suffer the rest of their lives?  Do any really believe that these people don't do drugs to forget, want to kill themselves.  Who will these people sue twenty years from now?  Planned Parenthood, Political Parties, or will they want to go after the Church again and claim that we did not fight hard enough to prevent it?  Anyone who is for abortion should look at the films of a baby being aborted, before saying they are for abortion.  Anyone who has had an abortion should seek out help, there are many web sites who can help.    www.priestsforlife.org  , sistersforlife.com,   www.touchedbyabortion.com   If after you have seen some of the films of the babies being aborted, or read some of the stories from those who have had abortions you still the same way, then at least you have researched both sides of the issue aand can make a informed judgment.  Why should they start a baby and then abort it for stem cell research when they are having better results with adult cell research from our own bodies.  Don't be like the slave sellers, slave owners or slave ship captains.  Don't be like the people in Hitler's Germany who looked the other way because they did not have all the facts or went along with the crowd even thought they though it was wrong.

Mathematics are not the ultimate truth about anything, neither should they be treated as unchangeable laws of the universe. Mathematics, as well as physics, chemistry, etc. are a set of tools invented by humans in order to explain phenomena we observe around us. We made sciences up, and it's up to us to upgrade them in order to improve our knowledge about the world.Here I didn't go as far as to point a flaw in mathematics or something that should be changed, I actually agreed that in most cases 1 is not 4, and I know how useful that is in our daily life. My point is, we can and should question and debate everything, even the foundations of something which has been working for us all along, because we can never know when old explanations might fail us. This is specially valid for the question of abortion, since our old conceptions about when life begins might be wrong.Anyways, if my semantic discussion of 1 not being 4 was not mathematical enough for you, here I got another one...""1 is not 4""Wrong, this is not always the case. When dealing with binary numbers, when 1 is in the third number from the right, as in 100, 1 represents 4. In 111, 100, 10100, and so on, the third 1 is always 4 (as in the decimal system)."	FAVOR

3580	abortion	I am sorry for your loss. Unfortunately, I believe that you are the exception. I am sure that there are many women out there who had abortions and would have kept the baby if they had the same level of support that you were willing to offer. Many women don't get that support. Alternatively on the point that men should be included in the debate, I have personally heard a few men exclaim that it is unfair that they made a mistake one night, and now have to pay child support for 18 years because they didn't have a say in the matter. So men's inclusion in the issue wouldn't necessarily lead to less   abortion  . I don't think that the government (or anyone else for that matter) should ever have control over women's reproductive choices. For instance, I would be just as strongly opposed to government mandated abortions as I am towards banning abortion all together. Many women, including myself, find it unfair that men enter the   abortion debate   because a man is intrinsically different than a woman. I don't have a say over a man's reproductive organs, nor do I think that I should. Similarly, I don't think that men, the government, other women, etc. should be able to tell a woman that she has to give up her body for 9 months, regardless of what she wants. It is making her a second class citizen and a prisoner to her own womb. Once again, I am sorry for your personal experience. Maybe people should decide as a couple where they stand on the abortion debate before engaging in sex. Even so, I guess that speculation about what you would do in the event of an unplanned   pregnancy   can't be comparable to when you are actually faced with the decision. 	FAVOR
3581	abortion	"1. The left is generally anti-war, pro healthcare, pro helping starving people in Africa, etc, all of which saves lives. Since I don't consider a fetus a life, from my standpoint the right is more concerned with vague moral standards only shared by the right than saving lives, but whatever.2. I'm talking about self-awareness, as in feelings. A fetus before the third trimester has 0 capacity to feel. They're not sad about being aborted, it doesn't hurt them, they don't have these human emotions yet. This is what I'm talking about. That an already born child likes its mom in no way invalidates this point.3. And here is the disconnect, you are absolutely correct. But the leap so many on the right are not willing to make is that abortion is always something to anguish over. Sure, there are bitches (and I don't use that term lightly) who simply don't care. But the vast vast vast majority of abortions are performed by women who feel they simply have no choice. It is not a party. But it's their choice, something they have to live with. Not the right wing, not you personally, just her, no one else's business. The only thing making abortions illegal would change is the number of mothers who die with the child. That's all it changes no matter how pretty this anti-abortion idea that ""if we just shove what we really really really feel down everyone's throat everyone will live happily ever after, amen"" - that's not how it works. Woman have been having abortions one way or another, legal or illegal, since the beginning of time.As for your point about rape. It's not the fault of the ""child"" only because the ""child"" doesn't exist. It's a cluster of cells and if she wants to abort it it's her choice, again, not yours.4. facts and logic never vary. People are wrong about facts and logic, but in and of themselves, they are constant. It is a fact the earth is round for example. Some have the ""opinion"" it is not, but this is not an opinion, this is simply wrong. There is a fact at the bottom of when a fetus becomes self-aware, people who study biology for a decade before becoming a doctor believe this to be around the 3rd trimester. Whatever the answer really is, I trust the dude who studied it for a decade over people who think they speak in tongues and give their live savings to Jerry Falwell. Is the exact moment as definite as the shape of the earth? No, probably not. But it's not that big a mystery, and while a valid opinion may vary by a month or so of when this elusive self-awareness begins, it most certainly is not upon conception, or even 2 or 3 months later. It's akin at that point to saying the earth has to be flat because when I stand on my roof I can't see it curve.Here's the difference between an argument with two different opinions, and the abortion debate.Indulge me, I enjoy coming up with analogies.2 people are walking through a forest. 1 wants to go left, the other right. The one who wants to go right says they both have to go right. The one who wants to go left says his friend can go right if he likes, but for himself, he thinks he should be able to choose.That's the gist of it. It's not a matter of two sides fighting about what everyone should do. It's about one side trying to force everyone to do something they may or may not want to and the other saying since we really don't know where either leads, people should have the choice."	FAVOR

To think that people would rather cut of life in its entirety than to take wiser options, such as setting their child up for an adoption, or even personally entrusting the baby to someone close to them. If I could 'personally' define the word 'abortion,' then it would be as follows:'ABORTION: The term refers to the irrational decision to KILL the child before it has been birthed from the womb'I am not going to sugar-coat abortions, because it's true, they are nothing short of murder! 'The children are killed before they can even process the thought' is one term that I have seen a few times in this debate (of course they have been worded differently, but again, I am not here to sugar-coat this sort of thing), and I can say that the mother/father has STOLEN the right and privilege of thought from these children by killing them. They have also denied them of love, care, protection and most of all, they have denied them of a life.As I have stated previously, I cannot even begin to understand why so many pregnant women do not consider putting the child up for an adoption rather than simply cutting the child off completely! Surely the majority of you all would agree with me that a child has its rights even if it cannot understand them!

This is the point that the   pro-life   and myself think is the reason we consider abortion an injustice as bad as a genocide: every tiny little embryo or fetus is already a HUMAN being from the point it's continuous development starts: conception. There are no substancial changes in it's genetic code from that moment on. From the moment an egg is fertilized no external agent interfere with it to change it's composition. Any interruption of it's development to a new born baby is the termination of a human being. I think we all agree that all humans have the same rights.If you accept this hypotesis then let's look at your comment under this spotlight:""Men (and sometimes women) tend to take very lightly the physical, psychological, and sometimes economic investment a woman makes during the 40 weeks of pregnancy""> This is so very true, it is a huge change to the woman that becomes pregnant, i don't deny it.Now as you said it only lasts 40 weeks, a temporary condition. Abortion is permanent, it terminates the life of an innocent human being.""As it is, today, something like 4 in 1000 women will die, worldwide, as a result of pregnancy. In developed nations, the lifetime risk of a woman dying as a result of one of her pregnancies is around 1 in 2800, but in places like sub-Saharan Africa, about 1 out of every 16 women will die as a result of one of her pregnancies over the course of her childbearing years""> The number of induced abortions declined worldwide between 1995 and 2003, from nearly 46 million to approximately 42 million. About one in five pregnancies worldwide end in abortion.(The Alan Guttmacher Institute)Your stats: 0.4 % CHANCES to die during chilbirth (0.28 in developed nations).My stats: 20% CERTAIN death of a human being.What is worse?As for all the reasons you consider can justify an abortion:Are any of these, except a life danger situation for the mother, enough to justify the suppression of a human life? ""There are many women whose lives are at risk if they become pregnant"">This is not true, these are your stats: 0.4% chances of death during childbirth""Some women will lose their jobs if they become pregnant, particularly if they have bedrest"">This is sadly true, but shouldn't we ask our politicians to protect the pregnant woman instead of just send them to abortion clinics? This is a point i see we both agree as you said in an earlier post: there is certainly more to do to avoid unwanted pregnancies, and aid women to carry on their pregnancy.""Some women are caring for several infants and toddlers already, who rely on them, and cannot undergo the stress of another pregnancy""> Is it justified, in such a case to suppress one of it's children to make life easier for her? That would be infanticide, no matter the excuse. Why is it possible to kill the one she carries inside? Because we don't see it, it is acceptable to kill it?""Sometimes minors become pregnant before their bodies are strong and developed enough to support a pregnancy without risking severe damage""> Here again we should work on making these pregnancies an exception. No severe damage is worse than death.On the rape issue: The statistics tell us that less than 1% of abortions is done because of a rape.This is a very emotive issue that pro-abortion advocates love to expose.This is nonetheless a tragic outcome of a rape, to get pregnant of the man that violated you.But how suppressing a human life makes it easier? Isn't it killing even worse than the act of raping?How aborting will help overcome what happened to her? She will have to carry the child for 9 months and then give it into adoption. ""...there are some very valid reasons for a woman to have one. And such decisions are best made by a woman and her doctor, rather than being forced upon her by society""> A lot of people i talked to upon the subject see it exactly as you: If we ban abortion it is like a personal moral issue that society forces on women. We are not against women, it's just that we really think that all humans are equals in rights, and first of all those rights is the right to life. Only in a situation where the life of the mother is in danger we can accept that an indirect abortion can be the outcome. No reason can be put forth to justify murder except self defense.

Why not set high standards for them sexually also, since nothing curtails an education like a pregnancy. Abstinence is the only practice that provides 100% protection against STDs and pregnancy, nothing else comes close.There is only one question when it comes to abortion, what is it? If it is a human being then it requires a very high level of justification to take it's life. I have simply seen no argument that comes close to proper justification for the taking the life of an innocent human being. The only arguments I have seen are those that try to take away the embryo's humanity and make it less than human.	AGAINST
3606	abortion	And while   pro-life   all give the same answer: life begins at conception, all human beings are also human persons, the   pro-choice   side has no official answer. This fact bears a consequence: while the pro-life answer gives a concrete solid starting point, the pro-choice side is at any rate incoherent within itself. Allowing   abortion   will always lead to kill what, for some of the pro-choice advocates, is a human being and with a right to life. My point is: since we cannot apparently reach a common definition on when a human being should be recognized as such and consequently respected it's right to life, shouldn't we take as answer the most   safe   of all which is at conception just in case?Example: if we go   hunting   with a friend and we hear the sound of what seems a stag shouldn't we double check if it isn't our friend instead, and if we cannot reach a conclusion not to shoot?

I threw my hands up a while ago and have just decided that anything that has both the potential to use environmental energy to combat entropy and has evolved counts as alive. I throw out the consideration of the potential for future reproduction. If it evolved to get where it is, then that is good enough for me. Viruses encode proteins that combat entropy. So do some plasmids. Prions do not*. Lizard tails and sperm are both definitely alive - until they run out of ATP and die.*Prions are always tough. There are some yeast prions where the normal (non-prion) state of the protein is an enzyme that would qualify as alive. As far as I know, the prion form always loses this quality.	FAVOR

I'm suggesting that   abortion   is taking a life, or murder if that helps frame the argument. That is illegal. Not taking action to save the life of someone, as in any life or death situation, always has moral implications, but itÕs not nearly as cut and dry as youÕre trying to make it out to be. Do I risk my own life by undergoing major surgery?  Am I willing to live my life with only one kidney and, should the other be damaged by any number of things, potentially die? What if I give up my kidney and then a member of my family needs one?  I never said it was perfectly moral to sit by and do nothing when I could be saving a life, but that doesnÕt mean IÕm compelled to have all my spare body parts out. I do donate blood every six months and that IS saving lives. We do what we can do.  But now, let me see if I understand what you are saying. If I have this right, you're saying there is no difference between failing to donate a kidney and deliberately killing someone. They are both immoral and thus equal. Do I have this correct?You also wrote; ÒIf you're going to use the ""it is the process decided by nature."" defense, how do we respond to something like a heart attack. Is it immoral to save a woman having a heart attack? After all, it's just nature taking its course.

The brains of humans in vegetative states also have active parts (the parts that keep there lungs and heart pumping, for example).  It must be a brain with consciousness, awareness, person-ness.

3623	abortion	"The question isn't whether   abortion   ought to be legal but rather - In the United States, and indeed throughout the rest of the world, does a human being have the right of self-determination and, at least in the United States, the liberty to exercise that right. This question, of course, was resolved a long time ago in the writing of the U.S. Constitution. It was answered affirmatively in the bill of rights in which the right of self-determination and the liberty to exercise that right is inherent in freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom to bear arms, etc. The intent of those who composed the constitution is quite clear - unquestioned right of self-determination and liberty to exercise the same. None of these rights and freedoms are possible without that basic assumption. If the tribe - and this is in effect how the nation behaves on a regular basis - chooses to interfere with a woman's right to control the functions of her own body, the tribe undermines the basis of all other individual freedoms thus destroying the heart of U.S. law - those principles written into the U.S. Constitution. If a woman's right to self-determination is undermined, so too you undermine freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, economic freedom, right to private property, and on and on. I believe the majority of Americans, particularly those arguing against the legality of abortion, do not fully understand what they are tampering with. They are, in fact, themselves inserting the wedge that will topple their right to ask and decide such questions in their own personal lives. It is but a short step from disallowing the right to choose abortion to legal control over when and if a woman has a child at all. If a woman does not absolutely own her womb, she at some point will be told when she can and cannot have a child, with whom, how many and how often. This sounds extremist, of course, however, this is the very real logical destiny called for by those who would destroy a woman's right to choose. If a woman cannot decide NOT to bear a child, she also cannot decide when she WILL have a child. The tribe reduces a woman to a mere walking womb belonging to the people.If the tribe refuses to allow a woman to decide to abort a fetus, then the tribe must necessarily take responsibility for that fetus. It necessarily become property of the people thus reducing a fetus/child to a thing for barter. It stands to reason, if you compel tribal decisions on an individual, the tribe is responsible for the consequences of those decisions, NOT the individual. Also, by promoting the fetus to the status of ""full human being"", you create a situation where you impose slavery on the mother to the fetus - the slavery of one full human being to another full human being. We, as americans, no longer legally support slavery and therefore, to be consistent, must do all that is possible to liberate the mother from slavery to that ""full human being"" growing inside her. The child MUST be removed and allowed to survive on its own. After all, it's a ""full human being"", is it not? If it is a crime for an individual to move into the home of another uninvited and forcibly take up residence, it is also a crime for a a fetus allegedly with full rights and liberties to be allowed to reside in a mother unwelcome. The rights of the ""fully human"" fetus cannot supersede the rights of the mother. If they are equal, the desires of each must be considered equally. The mother does not want the unwelcome guest. If the tribe decides to make decisions for that unwelcome guest, the tribe must necessarily resolve the situation of illegal residence - otherwise the tribe loses all legitimacy in its interference in the decisions of the pregnant woman and her right to decide for herself is restored by default.If the tribe condones slavery, the tribe has no legitimacy."

Of course it is not morally right if you are a Christian, but not everyone is a Christian and you have to respect their rights as well. Did not Jesus command, 'love your neighbor as yourself'? Your neighbor could be a Christian, atheist, wiccan, whatever, could they not? It is not up to you to judge someone, leave that to God.

Praise the LORD.""Genesis 25:8: ""Then Abraham breathed his last and died . . .""These are only a few examples of this symbolism.Against all this, the proponents of conception as the divider will trot out Jeremiah 1:5: ""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.""The biblical concept is human being becomes alive when the soul enters the body upon birth and the taking of the first breath.  This Christian belief was the basis for the English common   law   of inheritance, for example, noted by the SCOTUS in Roe v. Wade.Biblical references to death refer to ""breathing his last.""  Now   add   the symbolic essence of the Sacrament of Baptism. Not the pouring of   water   version symbolizing cleansing the soul of Original Sin, but the original (and still common) form by immersion.Immersion of the individual in water symbolizes a return to the womb, and when brought back up, there isa rebirth in Christ Jesus, symbolized by the taking of a new ""first breath.""Christian teaching in the 13th Century approved of   abortion   until ""quickening"" or a more formalistic (and different) number of weeks of gestation for male and female fetuses.  This can be found in papal writings as well as in St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologiae.Current Catholic teaching sets conception as the start. It's clear to me that such a standard should only be imposed on those who believe in such a faith formulation in opposition to the Bible-based truth spanning the human life from first breath to last breath.Creating a   legal   standard based on beginning human life at conception would be to define the end of human life as the termination of the process of decay.  we could expect:a. funeral rites where there is a spontaneous abortion or even an unusually heavy flow after being late with their mensesb. changes in the laws of descent and distributionc. a de-emphasis on ""birthday"" celebrations and a new emphasis on celebrating approximate ""conception day"" anniversaries(with my four   children  , I know an exact date my daughter was conceived, or at least the exact time of the romantic interlude - actual conception could have been a day or even two later.  With the other three, all I can do is count back a couple of weeks or so from ""missing."")d. a reformulation of the sacrament of baptism to perhaps eliminate immersion in favor of the ""cleansing the soul"" motif engendered by pouring watere. all sorts of issues in automobile negligence and other tort lawsuits.It's one thing to respect the process of construction - and quite another to call the structure a house from the time the plans are drawn by the architect and the building permit is issued.  Of course, people don't tend to build houses by accident, while   pregnancy   is often enough an unintended consequence.Human life in the abstract is a continuum - the egg that provided half my genetic blueprint was formed in my   mother  's mother's womb some time in 1927 or 1928, while the sperm that contained the other half was generated some time in the week or two before my conception in the early 1950's. And there was a point in those early 1950's when the eggs that would ultimately ""become"" my four children were formed, while the sperm that prvided the other half of their   nuclear   genetic inheritance were formed in the span from 1980 to the very early 1990's.In one regard, human life is a continuum without a real ending or beginning, and in another, the span of the life of a human being is between first and last breath.I believe in respecting life, even that of pre-born   babies   who are not yet legally human beings.  But I cannot in good conscience impose my own belief on someone else who does not believe the same way."	FAVOR

The options include, abstinence, condom and profalactics, birth-control pills, morning-after or plan B pills. If a woman does not want to get pregnant, she is free to choose these options of birth control, which - if used responsibly - have a high probability of preventing impregnation (Abstinence is 100% effective). Therefore, unintentional impregnation has a high correlation with the irresponsible or even negligent use or avoidance of birth control methods. As such, women are provided the right to choose to act responsibly in protecting their bodies from impregnation in the first place. Therefore, a ban on partial birth abortion may not deprive women of the right choose to take the initial, responsible steps in protecting against uninented impregnation. This may be a sufficient provision to women of the ""right to choose"" to adopt measures that will help them control the future of their bodies.

I affirm it with full conviction.You wrote: ""You ought to be more careful as it's a scientific fact that these animals all do think, and in the case of dolphins, might very well think more than humans do.""Your assertion is not an argument---nor is it persuasive. Your allusion to ""scientific fact"" is of the same type.But I am curious to know why you believe the lower animals can think.  Have you read an article written by a rat? Have you observed cats working to send a man to the moon?  Or maybe a chimp worked at your computer for a while where it accessed the net and discussed with an MIT professor the dangers of government interference in the economy? I'm not being facetious.  I'm quite serious. I am trying to stress that a process of thought is far different from a beaver making a dam prompted by his biological programming---and so forth in regard to all the other activities the lower animals engage in.  None of that is thought. Nor is thought the response to stimuli. A different process is involved when, say, we discuss our differing points of view.  I could not hold this discussion with any of the lower animals. Why do you think that is?  Is it merely because you and I share the same language?  Or is something else involved? For example, suppose we are in the same room and in silence I point to a chair. You would know immediately what that object was.  And if I also pointed to a dining table, you would again know what I was pointing to.  Then suppose I stated, ""I need more furniture."" You would know instantly that what I meant was I need another chair, or a bed or a side table.  This is an example of concept formation.  It is an abstract process that is unique to man because only we have the kind of consciousness required to do that kind of mental work.As for the rest of your comments, I regret to say I do not agree with anything you wrote.  As I said before, I do not consider a fetus a human being.  Consequently I cannot agree with your statements, which all follow from that premise. I do not consider it virtuous to compromise on the principle of individual rights.  I do not accept the initiation of force as a proper mode of civilized, moral conduct. Of all your assertions the one most grievously horrific is your statement that a fetus ""at some point its right to live should supersede a woman's right to abort it."" This says that a woman's rights should be at the mercy of whoever decides what that point is.  Would you enjoy having a  ""right"" that is conditional upon how much time an egg spends in your womb? Perhaps you would consider it your duty to give birth, since someone else says you must?  In any case, a ""conditional right"" is not a right at all. It is the wholesale destruction of individual rights. "	FAVOR

If you look at your own data, then 49% are clearly pro-choice and 47% are clearly pro-life.  Given a 3-4% margin of error, I think that there is no reason to regard this as a contradiction of my original thesis regarding a country which is split pretty evenly in half.  The question raised by the Mexico City Policy (MCP) was whether or not we should give financial support abroad to groups that would counsel women to have abortions as a form of family planning.  If half of the country would oppose this, then it cannot be consistent with our countries values.  It is consistant with half of the country and opposed by half.  Furthermore, poll data dealing specifically with the MCP shows that Obama's change in policy was supported by only about a third (35%) of the country- which makes it his least popular action to date.  -see link to Gallup poll below-    	AGAINST

When the MCP was legislated, it created a false majority for the pro life side by having their views be the default opinion representing the citizens of this country. Repealing the MCP just puts things back to where they should be: no legislative bias for either side. Now, international groups from both sides of the issue can fairly petition for some of this aid.

May 14, 2009: ""I've spent three decades working in or near biopharmaceutical research and development. During that time, I've witnessed breakthroughs as diverse as biosynthetic human insulin, bone-forming agents for treating osteoporosis, new cancer therapies, and a first-ever treatment for severe sepsis go from glimmers of intuition to everyday medical tools. [...] Inventions such as these -- and my list includes only the partial output of the company I work for -- have transformed the most basic expectations of human life in the last century. Today, the average life expectancy at birth in the U.S. is 78; when my mother was born in 1928 it was 57. (She's still in great health, by the way.) [...] Even in the last two decades of the 20th century, new medicines accounted for 40% of the increase in life expectancy in more than 50 countries, according to a recent study by Columbia University economist Frank Lichtenberg. In other words, for every year that life expectancy has increased, five months can be attributed to the availability of new medicines. [...] U.S.-based private industry is the heart and soul of this innovation drama, investing $58 billion in research and development for new medicines in 2007 alone. [...] it is vital to all of us that we insist that reform proposals pass the 'innovation test.' Providing insurance to millions of Americans through a government-run plan would fail the test. Similar efforts around the world have led to rationing of health care and created hurdles between patients and the most advanced treatments. On the other hand, innovation would remain reasonably secure if universal access were achieved through tax credits and government subsidies that allow patients to choose from a variety of private health-financing options."""

The money for it has to come from somewhere, and that of course is from taxes... and as Government involvement in the health care industry has only made things worse overall and not better, I don't see how it's possible that 1) giving them even more power will make anything better, and 2) that it's justified to implement this policy at the expense of both the sick and the healthy. If someone chooses to eat sugar-frosted sugar lumps for breakfast and drink bladder-busting bottles of cola, every day until they get severe diabetes, why should everyone else have to pay for their treatment? Takes away an incentive to choose a healthy lifestyle. The system as it stands now is no good at all, largely because of Government involvement. It seems to me that the Insurance/Pharmaceutical industries have penetrated Congress with their lobbyists to such an extent as to get regulatory laws passed that stifle fair competition, giving them the advantage of a cartel.

Please, wake up!  Obviously, some of you have no idea what that means.  I used to process Medicare insurance claims, what a joke.  They decide what they feel is medically neccessary, not you or your Doctor!  If they don't want to pay the claim, well it's final, it's not open for discussion and/or negotiations, it's just what somebody in the Government decided. Period.And when they do decide to pay, let me give you some examples:1>Flu Shot $15  Medicare approved amount $3 paid at 80% $2.40 to the DR.Doctors out of pocket cost $10 plus labor for the nurse, overhead exp, etc. - And the Dr. must write off the balance of $12, the patient is billed $.602>Office visit $100, physical therapy $50 - Total billed $150Medicare allowed $24 @ 80% $19.20 on the office visit, $0 on the physical therapy- deemed not medically neccessary.  The Dr. gets a check for $19.20, must write of $76, the patient is billed $54.80Who do you think wins here, right, the Government should, only they have paid out double or triple just to process these small checks!!When you have to call Medicare with a question, and trust me this happens frequently, you are only allowed to ask 3 questions, if you have 4 questions, you can ask the 3 and then hang up and call back, wait on hold another 45 minutes to ask the 4th question.  If you have never dealt with these issues, you simply can't imagine how bad it is, I'm not exagerating, ask around.  Surely you know an elderly person on Medicare, an insurance clerk, anybody that has had to deal with it.  Part 2 - Currently most Doctors pretty much accept Medicare, some because they want to help the elderly, as frustrating and expensive as it is, the paperwork involved is unreal.  That is one reason we keep seeing an increase in the cost of doctor visits, to make up what they are loosing in Medicare acceptance costs.  If it is all Universal Healthcare paid by the Government, you will see a flood of   doctors   stop practicing, it will no longer be profitable and full of regulations.  Just ask your doctor his opinion on your next visit.  We will have a shortage of doctors. Part 3:  We are already seeing   taxes   going up on everything.  Take the sin taxes for example.  One example: Sodas are now going to have a higher tax, because they are unhealthy. What happens when they decide you weigh to much, your too fat to have sugery?  Don't think that will happen, think again, there are already talking about it:     maybe you are the ideal weight, but what your friend, or family member that is 20 lbs. overweight, do you want the Government to deny them benefits?  If you say yes, then what's right about that?So please people, think about it, this is not good for our country!Last but not least, do your research on country's that have   universal health care  , how are they doing? And Canada's system is so great that Canadians leave their country to come to the US for many procedures that they have to wait months in line for in Canada. No less than a board of Canadian surgeons has urged the US not to enact a socialized medical system.Did you know a recent poll said if you are diagnosed with   cancer   you will start treatment in approx. 3 weeks here in the US, in other country's with Universal   healthcare  , the average waiting period for cancer patients to begin treatment is 9 months!  That is crucial when you are diagnosed with the deadly disease of cancer.  But this is standard even for emergency surgery, alot don't even last long enough for the surgery.

Our Military is socialism on a grand scale, and we have the Best Trained, Best Equipped Military in the World. So I used the same model in to model my Health Care Plan around.We recruit kids out of high school, that have good grades and a interest in the medical field, but because of financial reasons cannot afford to go to College. We get them to enlist in the Medical Corps, where we promise to pay for their entire Medical education, in exchange for a agreement of practicing in a Government Hospital somewhere in the United States for 10 years. At the end of the 10 years, they can either re-enlist or they can choose to go into private practice.Doctors and Nurses would be paid a competive salery but not as much as they possibly could be making in private paractice. However under the Government they do not have administrative costs, or Office exspenses, and no malpractice insurance premiums to worry about.The chances for malpractice would be reduced, do to the fact a person could get up to five different opinions if they were not comfortable with the original diagnosis. While this won't rule out malpractice 100% there will always be the doctor who makes a mistake. In which case the case would be reviewed and if found the Doctor was grossly negligent, would have his license to practice pulled.Most lawsuits today seek money to pay for future care of the patient, however that wouldn't be necessary, because you already have free medical.We could employ 500,000 doctors at a cost of 100 billion dollars wich would give us a Patient to Doctor Ratio of 600 to 1. Thats what are current ratio is. But the problem is there are communities who do not have any doctors, so they have to travel a great distance for care. This problem would be solved also under my plan.We buy up older hospitals to keep the cost down. We Do have strategically placed Expensive Diagnostic equipment within a 4 hours drive of any location. So it is possible that a person would have to drive up to 250 miles to get a MRI, but they would be able to deduct the cost of the trip on their taxes, excluding lodging. Obviously the goal of any Universal Plan is to contain costs and Improve care, if you cannot accomplish that then we shouldn't do it all.I estimate the total cost of my plan to be around $500-600 Billion a year.By paying of the debt, we could pay for a national health care system without raising taxes to do so. We currently will be paying $550 -$600 billion in interest on the debt next year. So if we can pay off the debt, which I can do in 7 years, and return this country to a lender nation, this country could afford to Universal Health care better than what France has, and I could still cut everyones taxes by $3800.00.Part of it would be paid for by interest money we would be collecting from other countries, once we became a lender nation again. By loaning Money to developing 3rd world countries we spread our influence over these countries by helping them develope, instead of China or Russia. The intrest we collect on the loans helps pay for our health care.This would lower medical costs, let consumers keep the money they currently pay out for insurance premiums and deductables, and reduce the cost for business who currently pay the lions share of a employees health care insurance.

Merck pharmaceutical sells its drugs to both private and public healthcare systems. Merck will be compensated for losses incurred by sales to public systems by passing the loss to private systems in the form of higher prices. So in a sense it is plausible that the public healthcare systems of the world actually exacerbate higher prices where healthcare is privately owned. Now back to our original subject. #1. What is the primary problem with the healthcare system of the U.S.? My answer: Ninety plus percent of the patients of the system cannot afford to pay the price of their own healthcare.#2. What is the root cause of the patientÕs inability to pay for healthcare? Is it A, healthcare is too expensive or B, that their wages are too low, or C other.My answer: B, their wages are too low.(My father, earning the wage of a garage mechanic, paid cash for the births of all of his children with less than four weekly paychecks each. Today, how many mechanics are paid 14,000 dollars a month, which is the average cost of an uncomplicated vaginal birth? )HEY! I am no longer going to continue debating or justifying my argument concerning U.H.Either people understand or donÕt understand what robbery looks like. I am not their god or their moral judge.Screw the logical formality of debating this absurd question!¥ Universal Healthcare is a crime against the working class. ¥ The question of this entire debate is nothing more than a question about the benefit of outright criminality.Indulge my short or not so short rant for a moment, if you will. I am extremely disturbed that in the hearts and minds of the U.S. populace, people abound in ignorance of the fact they advocate robbery when they push for public healthcare. They are implicating themselves as criminals and seek to justify their criminality by legislative action of the government. We are truly a nation of thieves. We, as a nation, are so mad upon our right to healthcare we want to violate the right of ownership of property, including the wages of all persons in the U.S. ItÕs as though there is no other alternative but to steal from one another, our children, parents, and friends. And the justification for all of it is that all is right because everyone will be doing it. (Bare in mind that they who argue the most for public healthcare have the most to gain by it. There will be 80 million baby boomers entering retirement in the next eighteen years. Should we suppose they want someone else to pay for their healthcare so that they can take cruises around the world? (Have you seen the bumper sticker on the $300.000 RVs that read: ÒI am spending my childrenÕs inheritance)Moreover how many of those baby boomers want people such as myself and our families to pay for their healthcare needs for the next eighteen plus years? This is too much like social security with perks! )Know this; we will have in the U.S. within a very short time frame a public healthcare system. And how do I know this? The baby boom generation of 80+million rules the country today and before too many of them have retired they will make certain that their children are bound by taxation for the healthcare needs of the baby boom gen. And so in conclusion, regardless of what is thought or not thought of public healthcare we working class stiffs will be paying in the form of taxation all healthcare needs of the most debauched, rotten, spoiled generation ever born in the U.S. The baby boomers are currently socializing the losses of the most cherished institutions of the U.S.; expect the healthcare system over the coming weeks and months of this year to also need taxpayer money.

America is wrongly held up as a beacon of hope and liberty and something to strive for for developing nations, and that annoys the crap out of me. It annoys me that what is considered the most powerful and free country in the world..And yes, it annoys me that citizens of a country that continually talks about freedom and liberty can't be bothered to give a few dollars out of their pay packet (though, they would be paying less, but we'll ignore that for now and assume that it would cost you a bit extra) to ensure that everyone, rich or poor, can get healthcare treatment when they need it.Healthcare reform that seeks to trample upon both liberty and freedom is the antithesis of the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If group A decides that its happiness is Sample B of Healthcare reform, they have no right whatsoever to use their rights of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to trample everyone elseÕs right of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to not consent to sample B of Healthcare reform. Or stated another way, no man has the liberty and freedom to trample another manÕs liberty, freedom, and pursuit of happiness. Ergo, that is why the proposed legislation of Healthcare reform is so hotly debated in the US. The people of United States of America should never seek to impinge another manÕs rights of life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness, by imposing their will upon their fellow man for the sake of legislated compassion. And any people who take upon themselves this god-like mandate of legislating Ôloving thy neighborÕ better take in to account that their version of altruism may be the pinnacle of tyranny.My solution to the healthcare issues that plague the US:Eliminate health insurance!

Is not the notion that all men are created equal a direct affront to anti-socialists?  How does any nation overcome the tyranny of the ruling class under which the masses suffered?Look at the history of man and how we gotten to be where we are today. History keeps repeating itself because there is this lie that has been believed that it is wrong to accept the enslavement of a small group who holds power over the needs... not wants... of all society - all men.  That socialism in any shape or form is wrong.   Capitalism is fine for the things that we want, but do not need.  It is what promotes the middle class and tears to pieces Marx's theory.  But history has shown us what occurs when what humans need is held up for sale to the highest bidder and those who can afford it.  History has also shown us that those who control those supposed ""markets"" of what is strictly a need are also the ones who can afford to exert such power and the abuse they reek upon the rest of SOCIETY.  En mass.  When one small group holds power over the needs of the masses, it is not the masses who are enslaving themselves to make the ""need"" available to all; it is the small group who holds the power who holds the masses enslaved to their own desires. It is slavery of the small, controlling power over the general public.  And when those powers exist in a capitalist society,  the desire to obtain more.  Capitalism breeds excess.  I love capitalism.  It has given more opportunity to more people than in any other system.  But it is not perfect.  There must be balances to this. These balances must occur in the needs of men.  We must balance out capitalism with the knowledge that history has given us - the needs of men are not for sale.  They must be available to all people.  Food, Water, and yes, Health care.    These are basic rights.  The denial of these rights by the people who control them have led to revolution after revolution... some violent and some more of an   evolution   than a revolution.   It is reasonable to assume that health care is a need and a right.  It is reasonable to assume that it is affordable, and well within our collective means.  We have survived as a species by working collectively.  It isn't altruism.. it was necessary for survival.  Looking out for your neighbor means that he will look out for you... and if he doesn't, the guy on the other side will.  Provided you're not a complete douche (which is the point of why it's not altruism to look out for your neighbor, but is actually done in self-interest).

My granddaughter was born at 25 weeks and 1.4 pounds, and is now a healthy, thriving 5 year old.Cuba? Cuba is a dictatorship. That means the flow of all information is strictly controlled by the government, and there is no free, investigative press or freedom-of-information laws. But just the fact that you use a dictatorship to support your call for socialized medicine is quite telling.When did ""we...as a society"" decide on government-run schooling? It evolved from a flaw at our foundingÉthe failure of the Founders to protect freedom of education from political intrusion, in the way that religious freedom was protected behind the Òwall of separationÓ between church and state. I fully and passionately believe that a proper education for every child is one of a parentÕs most solemn responsibilities. But I oppose government-run schools, for the same reason as I oppose government-run healthcare. It is immoral, impractical, and a violation of individual rights. But I guess, as an independent thinking human being, I donÕt qualify as a part of this ÒsocietyÓ that you claim makes these decisions. WhatÕs interesting here is that you would actually use the example of public education to justify socialized medicine. Public education is beset by exploding costs, and deteriorating quality...just what one would expect from a coercive political monopoly. American medicine is heading down the same path, due to massive government interference and controls. A complete healthcare dictatorship, rather than a return to freedom in medicine, is the wrong solution for anyone who values quality, readily available health care. An ""American caste system"" is exactly what would result from putting the state in charge of all economic decision-makingÉwhich is apparently what you want to do. In a free market...which we now have only in bits and piecesÉeveryone is free to act on his own judgement, and to advance as far as his ability and ambition will carry him. If one wishes to increase his pay, he is free to increase his skills, work longer hours, seek another job, or create his own job by starting a business. What he is not allowed to do, in a free, rights-respecting society, is force job-creating businesses to pay him more than they are willing to pay through government-imposed minimum wage laws. If you don't like the fact that a particular company hires people you donÕt approve of (moving jobs across seas), you are free to protest by refusing to buy their products. If you donÕt like a company's ""benefit"" policy, then again, you are free to move on. You see, when you are free, you control your life...which means you are not at anyoneÕs mercy. That is what the ""free"" in free market means. When government regiments the economic life of a nationÉwhen we are at the mercy of government officials...then actual individuals are locked into a cast, having become dependant on government favor. But I agree with you that "" 'Entitlements' aren't just lazy people trying to rip you off."" They are also big businesses seeking government subsidies, bailouts, and other favors. They are middle and upper middle class earners seeking ""affordable"" this or that, and then demanding that government force someone else to provide it. They are workers seeking ""living wages"" that they are not qualified for or that no one is willing to voluntarily pay them. They are residents of wealthy towns seeking to keep out lower-income ""undesirables"" in order to preserve the ""quality"" of ""their"" communities through restrictive zoning and planning practices. And, yes, they are also ""just lazy people trying to rip you off."" They come in all shades, classes, and regions. And the entitlement mentality engulfing this country is made possible by one single common denominatorÉthe governmentÕs power to hand out economic favors to some at the expense of others. A universal healthcare entitlement is a lose-lose proposition. You hand over your money to a central planning bureaucracy, and in return you give up the right to make your own health care decisions.

3818	healthcare	"I don't think you are understanding the argument, let me see if I can lend some clarity.1) Health care is not a ""right.""Rights are freedoms of action in a social context.  They are not an obligation on others to provide goods or services.  Yes, your right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness does mean that you have the right to seek medical services. It does not mean you have to violate the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of others by demanding they provide it.We have the freedom of speech but this does not put an obligation on others to reply what you said on TV and make others watch.  We have the freedom of the press but this does not mean the government should create newspapers for each of us, or that I can force the New York Times to print my views.  We have the freedom of religion but this does not mean the government ought to build churches at someone else's cost or force everyone into a single monolithic religion.  Like wise, your freedom to contract with others to attain goods and services does not mean that others are obligated to provide those goods and services.2) Other countries aren't doing it well so we shouldn't do it at all.You're right in your assertion that just because someone else fails at something does not mean we will as well.  However, all countries that provide or have provided universal health care have struggled or collapsed.  This doesn't mean we should give up health care but it does mean we shouldn't try to emulate faltering systems.  Could we improve? Possibly.  Will we improve? Maybe, no one's done it yet though.  Does this mean we should coercively enlist all people into a single system that we can't guarantee is better when all evidence shows it creates more problems?  No.3) It's ""Socialized Medicine"".We aren't paying only when its an emergency.  Why would we expect more of the same to work when it hasn't anywhere else?  Why should we avoid a system, the free market, when it has worked  in every where else?

3819	healthcare	The article tries to draw a distinction between the cost of healthcare and how much is spent on healthcare. That is playing with words. What it is actually getting at is the difference between the cost of healthcare and its efficiency.As the article points out, most single-payer systems cost between 8 and 12% of GDP whereas the US system is 16% of GPD. Remember that the US GDP per person is typically significantly higher than other industrialised countries. So we are talking about a higher percantage of a higher number. The cost/expense of healthcare per person is MUCH higher in the USA than other industrialised countries.Is this money being spent efficiently? Do US citizens get far superior healthcare to say French, Canadian or English citizens? It is important to look at the figures - not just quote newspaper headlines (especially the Daily Mail!).

Not as good as a free market system would be but a lot better than the HMOs and other quasi-socialized health schemes I've been forced to participate in. People should note, that under a free market system many types of healthcare arrangements would evolve to cater for various needs, including those on low income who cannot afford expensive healthcare. But as this argument shows, the socialists have nothing but hostility to any vestige of freedom in their system, they even want to shut down even the mild HSAs that allow the individual a modicum of control over their healthcare! (This is exactly what's happened in education, people are fleeing public schools to private schools and home schools, and teachers unions have opposed those options too). But don't take my word for it, you can be a victim of socialized medicine in any of the many places that practice it around the globe. I have.

As Jon Stewart pointed out very well part 1 part 22. We would pay for the healthcare of illegal non-citizens:Simply not true. There is nothing in this or any proposed bill that would lead one to believe it were true. There is nothing that could even be mistaken for something that could lead to this being true later. It's a lie aimed at a specific group of people to get them riled against the bill.3. They are going to take money away from Medicare:Ignoring that Medicare is a government program and the naysayers should be all for taking money away from medicare - if they were basing their arguements on principle at least - this is not true either. Here is where Medicare is mentionedA. in a pricing section stating a public plan shall not excede the price set in a Medicare program where the price has been set, ie, you can't charge more than medicare charges an individual.B. in defining ""qualified person"" one of the qualifications is to not already have Medicare Part A and B C. again referring to cost, it states pricing should ""substantially"" reflect the pricing under medicareThose are the only scare tactics I've heard so far, but I'm sure there are more, and if anyone is scared by them, feel free to read it yourself or ask me.Now for what it does say, cliff notes, the whole bill is there if you want more details:1. a person cannot be denied coverage for any pre-existing condition2. a person cannot be denied renewal based on anything at all3. prices should reflect prices set in existing government health programs (medicare, medicaid, VA, government employee healthcare, etc) and should not excede these costs and where prices have not already been set should be determined by the Secretary4. healthcare is mandatory for all citizens (the 30 million who don't have it need to get it, kind of like you can't drive without insurance)5. individuals choose their own doctor. An insurance co. can no longer tell you what doctor they will or won't cover, and of course the government does not tell you what doctor to see.6. medical decisions are made by health professionals (doctors, nurses, chiropractors, etc) and the individual, and insurance companies no longer have any say in the care of a patient7. no one can interfere with these rightsI fail to see the downside outside of the initial cost, which could easily be compensated by 30 million people paying into the system who currently do not.However, no program in the history of mankind has ever been perfect, and I'm sure there will be problems,but again, we have the worst Healthcare system of the industrialized world.

Second of all, how can I distort the glorious phrase when I have made no mention of it? What Mike Zermack is doing is firstly putting words into my mouth (or... keyboard? We'll have to invent a new term for that, I think) and the informing himself that I am wrong about something I have never said. Mike Zermack is further assuming that it is lack of material success that leads to a person's illness, poor health, apendicitis, pneumonia, or any other such thing.   Mike Zermack further leads us to believe that a person's health is not his welfare.   He further ignores the part of that ""glorious"" document that gives us the words (which I have not mentioned, at any point until now) ""all men are created equal"" that ensures our government shall ""promote the general welfare"".     Mike Zermack fails to grasp is that a government ""of the people, by the people, and for the people"" does not promote individual rights, it promotes the rights of ALL the people... for to promote only individual rights acknowledges that we are not created equal. To do so would be to go against the very nature of those words.  This doesn't mean that there are no rights OF the individual, but that promotion of the rights of all people is equal.  ""Of the people, by the people, and for the people"" requires that we work COLLECTIVELY. TOGETHER.  Synonymous for what? United? Hmm. Eeenteresting. Ze Germans would have agreed (but since most of the ruling families have had connections to Nazi-ism, it's not surprising). Further more, by allowing the ""free market"" - which everyone agrees does not work the way it should (for the same reason, incidentally, that communism can never work... greed and corruption) - to provide and promote (in a half-assed, greedy and corrupt manner) the general welfare instead of the government (which Is the people) and the health of ALL people suffer.  For the right of this is then limited to those who Have achieved excess in their pursuit of material success.    Again, as though lack of material success means that one just doesn't have accidents happen, or emergencies occur.   As though people who are poor don't work hard.   Because THAT's not a fallacy.

You know exactly what I meant...  but kudos again for being an ass about it.  Universalised health care doesn't mean doctors will be not be paid, or be paid less... it means that anyone who needs to see a doctor can.   So doctors will not be enslaved.  As it stands, the wealth of this country rests in the hands of the very few, who exert their control to keep it a very small group.  THAT is what I meant, and you know it. You also know I'm correct... but to do so would be to acknowledge to you small mind that perhaps the system we've been operating under doesn't work so hot. Further more, don't be such a presumptuous ass as to make assumptions about MY view because I  don't think Socialism is a dirty word...but is in fact a necessary component to a capitalistic society to balance out the inescapable fact that capitalism denies the rights of the individuals because it promotes power above individual rights; because  capitalism simply abuses human rights WHENEVER it can get away with it.  Because it is NOT perfectly functioning.  Or maybe you missed the part of that post where I said I liked - for the most part - capitalism?

Just why are the insurance companies in the way for health care? Money. This is a non-productive health care cost to the citizens. In fact it is a barrier for many to get the care they may need.As usual the proponents for the status quo neglect talking about the amount of savings to the public if insurance companies were no longer doling out the health care in the most minimal way possible.One has to look at what goes to the actual functions involved in care for individuals. We would be saving billions if health care were universal, in terms of what people and companies currently pay.More than half of the ""profits"" in the health care ""business"" are being eaten up by insurance companies. They have taken over authority for healthcare and left the liability for the doctors to suck on.Imagine if the healthcare industry didn't have to make the doctors pay for their insurance coverage, and if the public didn't have to pay for the mandated administration costs and directives for treatment of patients. Imagine a place where everyone didn't work for and pay the insurance companies. That is the sweet pot the insurance companies would have us do.Get sick, and who do you call? Some of the insurance companies that are ""supposed"" to provide the health care everyone pays for, would have you get ""preapproval"" to call an ambulance. Too bad the insurance company didn't contract an ambulance company in your region. Too bad you have to wait for the particular ambulance to be available while you have your heart attack.

Now, we have to assume that people, on average, will use more health care services when its all free, than when the price has to come from their own pockets. Since all of this will be paid for in taxes, which will be spread out evenly throughout the social classes, thus each person will, on average, be paying just as much, if not more, for health care. Since everyone will be using different amounts of this health care, some people will be paying for more than they are using, and others using more than what they are paying for. This goes against every tenet of a free market system.--Will inevitably reduce the quality of the doctors, procedures, and medicines. Since all governments want to have the lowest budget possible. Any government will look to the cheapest options, which will most likely be the lowest in quality. --Further more, the amount of bureaucracy necessary to regulate and record these new industries will be incredible, adding to the tax increase, but also creating a waiting period for people who need all sorts of medicines and procedures.As you can see a free market, individual, health care is the better system for all involved.

Why penalize Americans with a bureaucratic monolithic Health Care service?   Many lessons learned can be obtained if we take a deeper look at the   evolution   of the NHS in the UK.  Here are a variety of issues that have impacted socialized / universal care in Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, France & the UK.? Universal Health Care will mean an increase in   taxes  ? Will cap the salaries of clinical professionals? Will decrease the amount of specialist (access & credentialed)? Will limit innovation in   health   information   technology  ? Will limit innovation in medical devices? Will lower personalized services (one size fits all)? Will lower expectations for services, delivery & quality of care? Will increase wait time for procedures? Will increase wait time for surgeries? Will deny services (surgeries / treatments) for senior citizens? Will increase supplemental insurance premiums for privatized care? Will require additional travel to acquire medical services, especially specialty services? Will attenuate innovative procedures & roll out of new technologies? Will harm ability to deliver emergency care (ambulance limitations)? Will harm patient and consumer choice in services, physicians and treatment plans? Will increase layers of bureaucracy? Will lower requirements & require incentives for capped medical professionals? Will increase malpractice suits? Will harm patient safety? Will continue to provide medical services to un-authorized illegalÕs? Will increase foreign borne physicians ? Will lower clinical services, benefits & rights offered to over 80% of current insured Americans? Will lower the standards of care? Will require new Government protocols, regulation and mandates set up by bureaucrats, lacking medical credentials? Will lower patient options? Will close medical facilities and specialty services and clinics across the country (consolidation off services, for cost control)? Will limit   medication   competition? Will eliminate competition? Will harm Health Care supporting & contributing industries? Will decrease number of ""nationals"" physicians (medical school recruitment challenges)This is data that I have accrued over the past 24 years in Health Care information technology.  I have been providing national and international market research for more than 24 countries around the world (primarily OECD countries); representing Health Care IT and medical device firms wanting to break in to new vertical regions.  These challenges are sourced by Health Care professionals, administrators and managing directors; not local or regional news stories, but from the perspective of the current   environment  , business climate, opportunities for private versus public Health Care environments.Interesting factoids:1.	The fastest growing market segment in Health Care in the UK is privatisation2.	The number of national bourne clinicians has dropped by over 68% since the birth of the NHS3.	Cost for preventative maintenance in   healthcare   does NOT lower the cost of end of life care, therefore the findings are that prevention  is a cost as chronic diseases are merely managed not eradicated (diabetes,   cancer  , morbid   obesity  , COPD, heart diseaseÉ)Without a doubt the top reasons that aspects of Health Care will require nationalization or supplements form the tax payer(s) is:1.	Chronic Disease 2.	Catastrophic Care3.	End of Life Care4.	Pediatric Care5.	End of Life CareThe latest innovations in Health Care will be in the following arenas for cost control and management1.	The invention of hybrid care; balancing private and public allowing choice and consumerism as well as leveraging competition to push for innovation and new technologies to improve quality of life2.

3910	healthcare	The Case Against Universal Health CareWhy UHC is WrongUniversal Health Care is unconstitutional. As with many of the social programs that we allow to continue in violation of the Constitution; the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the government have no authority to redistribute wealth regardless of the purpose. Most people believe that the Constitution does in fact give the government the right to impose social programs. They derive this belief from two separate, but similar clauses. The first comes from the Preamble which says; ÒWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.Ó It is the phrase Òpromote the general welfareÓ that people often quote as the power to create social programs. In actuality, the Preamble does not give any branch the authority to do anything. The reality is, the Preamble is a guideline for the three branches. You could translate the Preamble to like this:More perfect Union = Better than EnglandEstablish Justice = Establish JusticeInsure domestic Tranquility = Peaceful Provide for the common defence = one army to defend (i.e. not controlling)Promote the general Welfare = all laws/regulations should not harm the countrySecure the Blessing of Liberty = Freedom for AllIf the government followed those guidelines for every law/regulation they form, they will be on their way to being Constitutional. However, the federal government must use Article 1, Section 8 to derive their powers. In fact, Article 1, Section 8 is where we find the second common misconception. This is where each power is enumerated to the Congress. The first clause states: ÒThe Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;Ó. We see here that a large part of the Preamble is restated but with a few notable differences. The most notable and important difference is to whom the congress can apply these powers. Pay close attention to the phrase Òof the United States.Ó Throughout the Constitution the founders use very specific terms to mean very specific things. When they wanted rights or rules applied to citizens they used the term citizens. When they wanted rights or rules to apply to anyone they used Òthe people.Ó When they wanted rights or rules to apply to States, they used the term States. When they used the term Òthe United StatesÓ they were talking about the federal government. If you replace the term Òof the United StatesÓ with its literal meaning you get a more clear understanding of its true meaning: ÒThe Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the Federal GovernmentÉÓJust so there is no confusion, you will find in the 10th Amendment that these powers are limited to Article 1, Section 8 by stating: ÒThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.Ó In other words: Ôif it ainÕt in the Constitution, you canÕt do it.ÕWhy it doesnÕt workEverywhere Universal Health Care has been tried, it has failed. UHC always becomes expensive, restrictive and lacks innovation. WeÕve been told that UHC is cheap. Well, that isnÕt the case. UHC is as expensive as the government lets it be. We only have to look here in our own country to see evidence of that. Medicare sets limits to what a doctor can charge for a visit or procedure. Every doctor charges the limit set by Medicare. They have to. If they donÕt, Medicare will assume that they have set the bar to high and lower it. Apply this to the entire health care system. If we expand that policy to cover every doctor and every procedure we will have several negative results. The first is the loss of talented doctors. People that become doctors donÕt just do it for the gratification of saving lives. The fact is, they lose every patient sooner or later. Doctors do what they do for the money, especially the good ones. If you take away their ability to demand a fair market price you take away the incentive to be a doctor and we lose good doctors. Another problem we will encounter is a short coming in available services. We can see this in other countries. Many countries with socialized medicine require patients to wait months or years to see a doctor. In some parts of Canada, the wait to see a doctor for a routine exam is two years. This problem is compounded by the lack of monetary incentive to be a doctor. Finally, because the government sets the prices, inventors and manufacturers of medical equipment will just fade away. Price controls never work. Further, innovative people will always find a free market where they can excel. Why we donÕt need itMost people have this idea that if they donÕt have health insurance that pays for everything that is even remotely health related that they will go bankrupt and die. That is not the case. Most people just need a type of insurance that is usually referred to as Catastrophic or Major Medical Insurance. Major Medical covers some very basic health issues. A good generalized definition is Òeverything that is life threatening or life altering.Ó In practical terms, that means if you have an expensive problem, you are covered. So you can go to the ER or hospital and pay only the deductible (or deductible plus a percentage depending on the plan). Major Medical plans can also be purchased with a prescription drug rider that will cover most prescriptions you will need. The health insurance we have all been told we have to have is called Comprehensive (or Premium) Insurance. Comprehensive Insurance covers everything Major Medical covers but also ads routine visits to the doctor. In fact, we all purchase Major Medical Insurance with the Comprehensive Clause added to it. This means that the coverage for ER and hospital stays is identical. The only difference being what you pay for a doctor. I got quotes from eHealthInsurance.com. I put in a family of four with both parents 30 years old non-smokers and 10 and 5 year old children. One quote was from Humana (Major Medical) and the other from Cigna (comprehensive). The Humana quote was for $196.04 per month, coming out to $2,352.48 per year. The other was from Cigna (comprehensive) and was very affordably priced at $292.00 per month or $3,504 per year. For a typical year, the family of four would probably have six visits to the doctor. Most doctors charge around $150 for a visit. If the family is on the Humana plan, they will pay $900 out of pocket because they pay for the whole thing. If they are on the Cigna plan, they will pay a $30 deductible per visit plus 20% which comes to $324. When you figure in the added premium, they donÕt save money. There is one big difference though, if someone goes to the hospital and uses more than $10,000 the Humana plan becomes much better. After $10,000 the Humana plan covers 100% of the cost, where as the Cigna plan covers 80%. This gives the person on the plan that weÕve all been told is not good enough a huge cost savings. What needs to be doneIÕm not one to dismiss an idea if I donÕt have a better idea of my own. My plan incorporates promoting Major Medical Insurance in conjunction with Health Savings Accounts. Health Savings Accounts are just as they sound, savings accounts specifically for health care. The government allows us (gee, isnÕt that nice of them) to put money into a savings account, before income tax is removed, and use it for health care. The catch is, at the end of the year anything that is left in the account becomes property of the government. My solution is to allow HSAs to roll over from year to year untaxed (unless used for purposes other than health care) and after an individual reaches retirement age the account can be used for any purpose. This will have numerous advantages from free market pressure on visits to the doctor to increased savings rates for the average citizen. We all know how the free market works and despite what some say, it works very well. When people have control over their money, they use it wisely. It is a precious commodity and they wonÕt hand over more of it than they have to. Even today, some health care centers are bowing to the pressure of the free market. Urgent care centers (doc in the box as my wife likes to call them) allow uninsured people to visit the doctor for as little as $75. As a patron of our local doc in the box, I can say that the care in these centers is fantastic. Part of the reason the down turn in 2008 and 2009 has been so severe is the negative savings rate that plagues the nation. With an incentive to save money before it is taxed, people will be more inclined to put their money aside for rainy days than use it to make monthly payments on maxed out credit cards that bought a house full of useless crap. In addition, IÕd allow them to put their excess HSA savings in bonds and cds so that they earn a small amount of interest with virtually no chance of loss. If the average family put $100 a month into savings from the time they are 20 to the time they retire, assuming they donÕt have more than 2 major medical bills in 40 years, they will have saved close to $1 million (after interest). I know that we do not need Universal Health Care. It is too burdensome on the tax payer, it provides for poor care and it is solving a problem that just doesnÕt exist.	AGAINST

Such a system is important from the standpoint of providing quality care, in that only a standardized system and unified database can enable doctors to treat any patient that comes in front of them. Privatized systems often see doctors unable to access the history and files of patients that come before them. The main reasons include the cost and complexity of unifying and standardizing a system as well as the lack of a private-industry interest in seeing such a system emerge. "	FAVOR
3912	healthcare	"Socialistbetty's reply to my commentary exposes the fundamental philosophical choice America faces...collectivism or individualism. Due to the importance of this conflict to America's future, and with space being limited here, I have written a detailed response and posted it to my blog at:    But let me make these points.Socialistbetty distorts the meaning of that glorious phrase; all men are created equal. The equality of all men (and women) refers to the unalienable rights of each individual to his life, liberty, property, and pursuit of his own welfare and happiness. Those rights are possessed equally, at all times, by all people, under all circumstances, protected equally by government; they can be forfeited only by violating the same rights of another. These rights are not a guarantee of the material success of any individual, only the right to take the actions that one deems necessary to achieve material success through one's own productive efforts and in voluntary association and trade with others. The equality of all men under the law is the essence of capitalism.Since all rights are unalienable, the violation of the rights of one single person necessarily negates the same rights of everyone else, including each and every individual member of any group such as the ""collective"", the ""herd"", the ""masses"" and ""society"". And if no one possesses rights, then the state is all-powerful. This is the totalitarian premise, the ultimate logical consequence of which is Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany.  If this is the ideal Socialistbetty is going to embrace, then she should have the courage to openly admit it, rather than claim the lie that ""the masses"" can benefit under a slave state. At least, though, I give her credit for acknowledging that ""universal healthcare"" is slavery. No other advocate of socialized medicine that I know of has ever admitted the obvious fact that they are calling for ""the enslavement of a small group""...the doctors (among others).The view of man the individual (my view) as the standard of value with regard to social organization is an historically recent discovery that is consistent with the metaphysical facts of nature and, thus, leads logically to capitalistic freedom. The collectivist premise (her view) is a primitive, mystical doctrine that dismisses actual, individual human beings as valueless, sacrificial fodder for the ""needs"" of some ""higher power"". Modern collectivism merely replaces a supernatural God as that power with some group called the ""proletariat"", ""society"", ""the masses"", the ""master race"", etc., to which the individual is subordinate, and which leads logically to totalitarianism. Reason and observation will show you why it's a good idea to have a healthy society of free individuals, not a collectivized slave state. "	AGAINST

Now some advanced counties have problems with lack of hospital beds and waiting lists for treatment. But the reason for this is that the poor are on the waiting lists and are filling up the hospital beds. In America, large numbers of people can't afford medicine.

Law enforcement, military, and prisons are constitutional, health care is not. For decades free market health care delivery worked just fine. When I was a lad of 7 (42 years ago), my mother and father took me to a local doctor, where they paid $5 for the visit, and at the time of the visit. There was no billing, either to my parents or to a third party. He had a nurse who worked for him, who also doubled as a receptionist.Today's doctor's office is filled with extra billing people, filing people, etc., just to fulfill the insurance requirements for billing for services. 42 years ago, $5 equates to about $20-30, which is about the cost of co-pay. Yet, insurance companies pay hundreds more for that office visit. Therein lies the problem.It's quite simple, really. Government has mandated too damn much. It has run up the cost of the health insurance. What do I need maternity coverage for? My wife is 50 years old, and I am 49. We aren't going to have a baby any time soon. I also don't have any mental health issues, or substance abuse issues. Neither does my wife. Why do we need Mental Health parity?The free market would allow consumers (that's us, John) to select the coverage they desire or need, if any. We could bargain with companies to get the best coverage for the best price. Consumer Reports could tell us which insurance companies would do that. Then we, the consumer, could decide which company to buy from, and what coverage we need (cafeteria style ring a bell?), if any. That's the beauty of the free market, it gives us freedom to choose what's best for ourselves and our family. Government cannot do that. They do not have the omnipresence, or omniscience to do so.

3939	healthcare	Where is this free market you are talking about?People are not allowed to buy insurance from companies in other states.  Insurance companies have per-state mandates on what services they must cover.  The tax code ties people's health insurance to their job by not providing the same tax benefits if you buy insurance on your own and also by forcing your employer to pay a large sum of it.  Insurance itself has become a non-market by removing the need for patients to consider the costs of the doctor's services. The government already pays for 50% of all health care related expenses.What aspect of any of that is even remotely similar to a free market?  The fact that profits and money are involved?  That's a shallow argument.  What we need to is to free the health care market by removing government interference that limits choices and encourages higher costs by making them hidden from the consumer.  People also gain profits from food, in fact, if it was not for that profit you can be certain that food would not be so easily available.Also, no one is denying people health care by refusing to provide it.

Cancer can be compared to a person who is attacking you. If a police officer is near you while you are being attacked, he will obviously intervene because it is his duty.

How could we be sure that our   children  's children will have the same opportunity as we do- having adequate medical insurance because of our job or financial status? Life changes and the economic cycle change, and with this American   economy   is also floundering, hence, the number of unemployed and uninsured Americans continues to rise. Inspite of our advancement in   health     technology  , the uninsured still do not receive the same level of care as the insured. Nearly two-thirds of these uninsured adults do not have access to medical care, thus increasing health and   health care   disparities, as well as health care costs. They often come to the emergency departments with life-threatening illnesses for they could not receive the preventative care nor proper treatment for their chronic illness (i.e. lung disease, high blood pressure, and or diabetes). The US can no longer afford to sacrifice a major portion of its citizenry to inadequate, substandard access to health care.Providing universal access to health care in America would be a major step in improving and removing the disparities of both health and health care currently reflected in our health care system. Both politically and fiscally, a national   health insurance   could not only improve medical care for the poor but also for the majority of insured Americans. UHC plan based its argument on the premise that the health care system can be cured by taking the profit motive out of the system - as other countries do. The current HMO/PPO bureaucracy consumes almost 30% of all the dues designated for health care, to echelon of administrative bureaucracy. Insurance companies have entire departments whose only function is to find ways to deny payment. Conversely, hospitals have entire departments trying to be paid from insurance companies - now that is a waste of precious resources. By reducing this bulging bureaucracy, an estimated $140 billion could be saved annually, leaving more than enough funding for the uninsured and the underinsured. A recent study evaluating the California Health Service Plan (CHSP) has shown that a single government payer linked to public authority and accountability can effectively finance health care and significantly save on health care spending, while improving the health of the population This will make health care  affordable, cheaper and provide access for all.

But altruism is really an anti-morality, which offers a person no moral guidance on how to achieve the values required for his survival and happiness, but rather simply declares that he is moral only to the extent that he gives up his values for the sake of others...any others.That is why altruism is always the justification for all forms of tyranny, including government-imposed ""universal health care"", which is merely a health care dictatorship in disguise. A consumer's right to decide for himself whether and what type of health insurance to purchase; An insurance company's right to determine what insurance products it will offer, based upon its own market judgement; A doctor's right to choose his patients, the treatments to pursue, and the price he will charge; The rights of consumers, insurance companies, and doctors to negotiate and contract voluntarily with each other to mutual advantage; The rights of all people to decide whether, when, what type, and what level of voluntary charitable giving to offer others...these are all merely selfish concerns, according to altruist principles, of no consequence next to a government takeover of a major industry. It's quite all right for the government to trample and sacrifice the rights of people acting in their own self-interest. It's quite all right to sacrifice the earnings, the healthcare decision-making, the careers, the goals, the personal judgements, and the business decisions of private citizens. It's quite all right to hand enormous coercive dictatorial power over other peoples' lives to ""altruistic"" central planning bureaucrats. It is quite all right to bestow unearned benefits obtained forcibly from the sacrificial victims of an altruistic state on those who did not earn them, but for whom it is apparently o.k. to selfishly accept their stolen property. Well, the game is nearing an end. Tyrants, ""social justice"" totalitarians, humanitarians with a ""good cause"" in one hand and the lever of a guillotine in the other, and all manner of politically-connected do-gooders have been riding the altruistic gravy train long enough. All of the ""should be"" goals listed by the National Physicians' Alliance are desirable when taken out of context. But a government that attempts to achieve those ends can only do so through the power to loot and enslave, which ultimately leads to the opposite results. It is an immoral government. So now let it be said. No one who would use initiative physical force, including ""democratic"" or ""legislative"" force, against his fellow citizens to achieve his endsÉno matter how worthwhileÉcan wave the banner of morality. That banner belongs only to people who renounce the initiation of physical force, and turn instead to respecting and protecting individual rights...everyone's rights equally and at all times.And that means, in the field of medicine, pursuing the moral goal of phasing out the current crumbling government-hampered system, and establishing a completely free market.Now that would be the moral thing to do."

I can empathize with you on the specialist thing. I had to see a retinal specialist last year once a month for 6 months. The receptionist warned us not to bother coming early bc there would be a wait. The wait every month no fail was AT LEAST 3 hours even with an appointment scheduled. Now that was a retinal specialist. Think about how many poor people are plagued with diabetes and are suffering retinal damage because 1. they cannot or/ do not want to care for their diabetes or 2. are not able to get medical attention. If all those people were suddenly blessed with universal health care that wait would be off the friggin chart. And thats just for diabetic retinopathy. Now imagine cardiovascular disease, resiratory and, mental diseases; all of these diseases are more prevalent in low income populations aka those that are most likely to not have health care coverage. Where are we going to get the doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, cardiologists, rheumatologists, CNA's, PCA's, and the like, not to mention room in the wards and equipment to care for there patients? I have been in the hospitals for more than 2 years now and even with that little experience I can say that hospitals, although touted as near rackets by most, are strapped for staff and properly functioning equipment. An average nursing assignment is determined by most facilities to be at 4-5 to ensure safe care for all patients. In reality nurses are assigned upwards of 6. In nursing homes and rehab settings it can be upwards of 16 (where I work). The most I have seen is 22. This means less care for ALL of the patients involved not just the poor, and is frankly dangerous to everyone involved.As a health care provider it breaks my heart to see people suffering for financial or lack of insurance or whatever, but handing it to everyone in a country this size with a medical field as lacking as ours is is totally unrealistic. First fix the health care system as a whole THEN invite everyone. I also advocate for plans like MassHealth. So many people knock it but my family was on it for 1 year and it was not bad.

It's not. A single payer system is one where the government pays for everything through tax revenue, like they have in Canada. This is a   public option  .Second of all, people are calling it socialized   medicine  . It is also very not. Socialized medicine is where the government actually owns the hospitals and the   doctors   are government employees. That's what England has. That's what the VA is. That is not what this is.People who oppose this like to tell horror stories about the other countries that have systems like that, single payer and socialized. The best example I can think of is this one.    Which I'll summarize again. Feel free to act this out on your own.""Morris:Ê And what's going to happen is the same thing that goes on in Canada.Ê Because of the long wait for colonoscopies, the incidence of colon   cancer   in Canada is 25 percent higher than in the US.And because the two top drugs we use for chemotherapy for advanced stage colon cancer are not available in Canada because of costs, the death rate is 2 % higher.Ê 41 percent of Canadians die of colon cancer compared to 32 in the US.O'Reilly:Ê That is one of the most compelling things about your book, is that you deliver statistics that say Americans are a lot healthier than Canadians are in the vital disease categoryÑheart disease, cancer, things like that.ÊMorris:Ê Let's quantify it.Ê 6 percent lower death rate from heart disease and a 16 percent lower death rate from cancer in the US.Ê And Canada has more poor people.""There are two possibilities here. One is that Dick Morris is telling the truth. If he is, then you have to compare the survival rates to the amount of   money   going in. Remember, Canadians spend half as much as Americans per capita on   health care  . 6% for 50% less money? Okay.The other possibility is that he's not telling the truth. Remember the 12,000, 18,000 and 100,000 numbers. Also, check THIS out.A large study found that five-year survival rates for many diseases in this country are no better than they are in countries that spend far less on health care. People here are less likely to have long-term survival after colorectal cancer, childhood leukemia, or a kidney transplant than they are in Canada.    According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, we spend $412 per person on health care administrative costs, versus an average of $72 for peer OECD countries. Six times as much. Here's a cool graph thing.    Something else I keep hearing is about wait times. Canada, the UK, oh the Wait Times. Often there are anecdotes.So I went to Business Week magazine, the INCREDIBLY LIBERAL SOURCE, who was studying the issue. ""In reality, both data and anecdotes show that the American people are already waiting as long or longer than patients living with   universal health care   systems.""    So remember. We've got the same wait times, but we spend twice as much money. If Canada, France, GB, etc. doubled the money they were spending on health care, it would be incredible. There'd be house calls! Best hospital   food   ever! Wait times wouldn't exist!Now, if we in the US cut our medical expenditure in half, how long would our wait times be? How bad would it get?So why are people ACTUALLY hating on this?Same QM Time, Same QM Channel!"	FAVOR

What they are trying to push is system where everyone has the right and can afford health care when they DO need it. I am all for that.

3998	healthcare	How is it not a quick fix? For starters, one of the main problems with health care in America is its lack of doctors and its price at doctor fees. America has more malpractice suits than any other country, which means that our doctors need to be heavily insured. The more our doctors need to spend, the more we need to spend. The problem with American healthcare system is not who is paying for it (private insurance agencies, or the government) because in the end the people paying for it are, well, the people. The real problem is becoming a loss in education (check out how the education cuts schools are taking. I know at Framingham State College they are about to cut the English Department by nearly two thirds). Less education means less high paying jobs. Less high paying jobs includes doctors. Universal Healthcare will not work unless America gets more doctors (if everyone has coverage, everyone is going to go--especially in situation where before they had decided not to: this means that some people may expect a doctor to treat their every cold, their every cut, and their every bruise. There will be those who abuse the system) and America cannot get more doctors unless it aids students in becoming doctors (and then protects its doctors from oftentimes ill-advised lawsuits). Again, I will repeat my main point. A Universal Healthcare system will not aid this country's economic situation. It will not help the people. It will hurt them. The middle class will bear more weight (and taxation) upon their shoulders. The middle class now is already paying for the healthcare of illegal immigrants. I think to solve the problem with growing medical fees in this nation, a change from private to universal healthcare will not promote economic security (in fact, health insurance companies are pretty big companies employing thousands of people across the country--would switching to universal healthcare put them out of jobs?). Universal healthcare is not a band-aid, so why should it be treated as such? It is just a change of structure, not a change to fix the economic and social crises of the nation.	AGAINST

Two, the financial burden of Health Insurance is taken off the plates on the individual families, many of whom could not afford it. Instead Health Care is paid for through the province in which you reside. Should you want Private Health Care, it is available.I can also tell you that often Hospitals are backed up. Not enough staff is usually the case. Lots of the infrastructure (buildings, etc...) are getting older, and may not be being maintained effectively. This is a typical effect of placing, one, health care costs on a single party and, two, in the hands of elected officials. Often the budget doesn't allow for many of the things that are required by the Ministry of Health, or the politicans charged with making decision don't understand the pros and cons.All in all, I would not change the system, just amend it. Socialism (one of the governing philosophies in Canadian politics), allows for the freedom of the individual while taking care of the needs of the community. Any person in the Province of Ontario (for example) has the right to education, health care, etc... And the province provides these rights to the province.

4149	creation	"""Who designed the designer?"" is a valid and important point, and IDs fatal flaw.  Jay Richards argues that not knowing ""Who designed the designer?"" does not prove that there was no designer.  Just as design can be inferred from Mount Rushmore (his example) without knowing anything about who designed it or where they came from in turn, so the complexity of life demonstrates design even though we know nothing of the designer except that he/she/they/it exists.  Fine.  I agree that lack of knowledge concerning the designer does not prove he doesn't exist.  I only argue that by IDs OWN ARGUMENT (that complexity requires intelligent design), the complex intelligent designer itself MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN designed, leading to a near-infinite regression that Richards himself acknowledges.  Richards then argues that each person may have his own explanation concerning how the ""First Designer"", be it god, an advanced alien species, or matter itself (his example), came into existence.  But no matter how you explain the existence of a First Designer, the explanation must either hypothesize complex intelligence in the ABSENCE of a previous designer, or it must hypothesize a supernatural god that who doesn't have to obey ID's rules.  Assuming that you IDers are not hypothesizing god (which would make this a theological debate, and make ID creationism-in-sheep's-clothing), you must then be suggesting that the First Designer would have been complex enough to design the next designer in the chain without being designed itself.  Does your theory allow for the existence of a natural, but complex and intelligent being that was not itself designed?  If not, then we have an infinite regression.  If so, why not hypothesize that Man is that being, and that we just don't yet understand how its possible?  Sid"	AGAINST

Are you asserting that evolution is observable in controlled artificial laboratory experiments? Then, if you are, how is that evidence of evolution when it can only be evidence of artificial manipulation of a species? I thought evolution is a naturally occurring process, not a consequence of a controlled experiment in a lab. Allow me an opportunity, here and now, to describe in part my approach in answering the question of intelligent cause.The axiom of my argument: The laws of mathematics are the consequences of an intelligent eternal cause. No man or group of men can claim that he/they is/are the author of the laws of mathematics, for the laws existed before a man recognized them. We can however, fundamentally claim that man recognized by reason the known laws of mathematics, but never can it be claimed that man is the author of that which he has recognized by reason. The laws of mathematics existed before they were identified by man. They are eternally true. For example, 1+1+1+1+1100=1104 is true now, and is true thirty trillion centuries from now, and has always been true apart from time itself. This is an eternal truth for the equation is true apart from time itself. When there exists eternal truths that are only recognized by intelligence such as I describe there is an eternal cause of those consequences. And since mathematics is an exercise of knowledge and intelligence it is therefore the consequence of an intelligent cause.If someone would like to contradict the conclusion of my argument I offer an invitation to do so. However, the difficulty in opposing this view is that the opposition must prove that there was a time when 1+1= not 2. I have loosely laid out some of the evidence that supports the deductive conclusion that the whole of the creation is a consequence of intelligent design. And as necessary, I will add thereto so that my statements are understood in the manner I have intended.	FAVOR

Carter articulated the Anthropic Principle as a reaction to overuse of the Copernican Principle, which states that we are not at a special position in the Universe. As Carter says, ""Although our situation is not necessarily central, it is inevitably privileged to some extent""The paper references isCarter, B. (1974). ""Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology"". IAU Symposium 63: Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data: 291-298, Dordrecht: Reidel.So the following part of Island's claim is correct""the Anthropic Principle was originally formalized by Carter ""--CarterCopernicus taught us the very sound lesson that we must not assume gratuitously that we occupy a privileged central position in the Universe. Unfortunately there has been a strong (not always subconscious) tendency to extend this to a most questionable dogma to the effect that our situation cannot be privileged in any sense. This dogma (which in its most extreme form led to the 'perfect cosmological principle' on which the steady state theory was based) is clearly untenable, as was pointed out by Dicke (Nature 192, 440, 1961), if one accepts (a) that specially favourable conditions (of temperature, chemical environment, etc.) are prerequisite for our existence, and (b) that the Universe evolves and is by no means spatially homogeneous on a local scale. --How to translate this or map this to Island's claim is more difficult. Carter points out some interesting points that the Copernican position can be taken too far, which leads to a dogmatic thinking. Rather I will approach the topic by quoting Carter--CarterMy own interest in this matter arose from reading Bondi's (1959) book Cosmology in which certain widely known 'large number coincidences' are listed as evidence justifying the introduction of various exotic theories (e.g. involving departures from normally accepted physical conservation laws) of which early examples were the 'varying G' theories of Dirac and Jordan. I am now convinced of the opposite thesis: i.e. that far from being evidence in favour of exotic theories these coincidences should rather be considered as confirming 'conventional' (General Relativistic Big Bang)  physics and cosmology which could in principle have been used to predict them all in advance of their observation. However these predictions do require the use of what may be termed the anthropic principle to the effect that what we can expect to observe must be restricted by the conditions necessary for our presence as observers. (Although our situation is not necessarily central, it is inevitably privileged to some extent.)---So on one hand Carter does warn against dogmatically applying the Copernican principle, I am not sure that the full description of Island can be found in this paper.  The anthropic statement for instance was in response to Bondi's book in which he introduced several coincidences which would required additional, exotic theories to be proposed, including departures from conservation laws. Contrary to this Carter argues that these coincidences are well in line with common scientific understanding once we accept the  anthropic principle"	AGAINST

The longest-running microbial evolution experiment was started in 1988, at which time twelve populations were founded by the same strain of Escherichia coli. Since then, the populations have been serially propagated and have evolved for tens of thousands of generations in the same environment. The populations show numerous parallel phenotypic changes, and such parallelism is a hallmark of adaptive evolution. Many genetic targets of natural selection have been identified, revealing a high level of genetic parallelism as well. Beneficial mutations affect all levels of gene regulation in the cells including individual genes and operons all the way to global regulatory networks.

A recent information-theoretic (but intuitively evident) definition identifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores about its environment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in populations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolutionary transitions that increase complexity. We show that, because natural selection forces genomes to behave as a natural ÒMaxwell Demon,Ó within a fixed environment, genomic complexity is forced to increase.--Christoph Adami, Sequence complexity in Darwinian evolution, Complexity, Volume 8 ,  Issue 2,  Pages: 49 - 56 , 2002 --Abstract--Whether or not Darwinian evolution leads to an increase in complexity depends crucially on what we mean by the term. Physical complexity is a measure based on automata theory and information theory that turns out to be a simple and intuitive measure of the amount of information that an organism stores, in its genome, about the environment in which it evolves. It can be shown that the physical complexity of the genomes of clonal organisms must increase in evolution, if they occupy a single niche and if the environment does not change. This law of increasing complexity is a consequence of natural selection only and can be violated in co-evolving systems as well as at high mutation rates, in sexual populations, and in time-dependent landscapes. Yet, co-evolution, because it can be viewed as creating an increase in physical complexity across niches, is likely the agent of a global increase in complexity.--Richard E.

Masking out the galactic plane does not eliminate signals of anisotropy seen in the full sky studies. As consistency checks, the anisotropies of CMB plus simulated synchrotron emission contamination from the plane of the galaxy are detected by our methods in just the spatial regions where they are simulated. The observed anisotropies cannot readily be explained away by appealing to galactic foreground contamination. --Testing Isotropy of Cosmic Microwave Background RadiationAuthors: Samal, Pramoda Kumar; Saha, Rajib; Jain, Pankaj; Ralston, John P.MNRAS, 385, 1718-1728 (2008)and--Recent analyses of the WMAP data seem to indicate the possible presence of large-angle anisotropy in the Universe. If confirmed, these can have important consequences for our understanding of the Universe. A number of attempts have recently been made to establish the reality and nature of such anisotropies in the CMB data. Among these is a directional indicator recently proposed by the authors. A distinctive feature of this indicator is that it can be used to generate a sky map of the large-scale anisotropies of the CMB maps. Applying this indicator to full-sky temperature maps we found a statistically significant preferred direction. The full-sky maps used in these analyses are known to have residual foreground contamination as well as complicated noise properties. Thus, here we performed the same analysis for a map where regions with high foreground contamination were removed. We find that the main feature of the full-sky analysis, namely the presence of a significant axis of asymmetry, is robust with respect to this masking procedure. Other subtler anomalies of the full-sky are on the other hand no longer present. --So far I have seen few data that suggests that the data show that the earth is at the 'center' of the universe.

4200	creation	That is your opinion.The truth of the examples given, and those not given, these being: bacteria, viruses, prions, whether disease causing as in flesh eating bacteria or whether innocuous does not change the fact that what is being observed can only be described after the fact. That live virus forms are engineered and released onto the unsuspecting human population is no consolation to those viruses that never got a chance to get started. Live viruses only protect against one clad, are unstable, and vaccines generally contain co-contaminants that are a result of the production process. Another Case in point: pig farms. Overuse of antibiotics breeds new forms of superbug. What is really happening is that the bugs are already there. Those more successful, or less inhibited, become more prevalent in their environment. Does this mean that man causes all disease to begin with? Hardly.In the end Darwin said it best in On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life:Let it be borne in mind in what an endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic productions, and, in a lesser degree, those under nature, vary; and how strong the hereditary tendency is. Under domestication, it may be truly said that the, whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic. Let it be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life. Can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life, should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed.

According to Irons, Judge Jones rightly scrutinized the religious beliefs of ID theorists while ignoring those of Darwinists, asserting that atheism naturally Òfollow[s]Ó from evolution, whereas religion motivates ID.  This is empirically false,22 and stands the First Amendment on its head: can Irons seriously claim that the First Amendment requires discriminatory treatment toward scientists because of their religious beliefs?  By arguing that Richard DawkinsÕs atheism ÒfollowedÓ  from evolution, Irons concedes that metaphysical implications of a scientific theory cannot render it unscientific.6. Irons repeatedly misrepresents and misstates facts. IronsÕs factual errors are too numerous to catalog, but we highlight some of the most egregious: Irons incorrectly conflates ID proponents with Òbiblical creationists.Ó  He wrongly implies that ID must reject common ancestry.  He accuses Michael Behe of failing to repair a purported ÒdefectÓ in irreducible complexity, without revealing that Behe has responded to this objection.  He claims the John Templeton Foundation (JTF) asked ID proponents for research proposals which Ònever came in,Ó but JTFÕs vice president denies that such a request was ever made, calling the episode a Òmedia narrative manufacture.Ó  Irons alleges we ÒhijackedÓ Stephen Jay Gould, but Gould plainly agreed with Niles Eldridge that Òthe higher up the Linnaean hierarchy you look, the fewer transitional forms there seem to be.Ó  Irons insinuates that Ònot oneÓ of DIÕs fellows in the Center for Science and Culture has expertise in paleontology, ignoring the various ID proponents who have studied (or published) in mainstream paleontology circles, including on hominid evolution.  He claims Òno ÔintelligentÕ force can be observed or measured by any scientific process,Ó yet we explained that scientists study intelligence by observing humans and seek to detect intelligent action in SETI (Òsearch for extraterrestrial intelligenceÓ) programs. Irons uses poor sources for many of his claims, which may be why he is so inaccurate.Irons repeatedly falsely insinuates that we misrepresent quotations through omissions, but he misrepresents through creative quoting himself. For example, Irons claims William Dembski takes the position that ÒI am a Christian, therefore I reject evolution,Ó but ignores DembskiÕs actual position: ÒIntelligent design . . . has no prior religious commitments and interprets the data of science on generally accepted scientific principles.Ó  It is Irons who has attempted to Òswift-boatÓ the character of ID proponents through selective citations.Rather than refuting our substantive arguments, Irons attempts to divert attention away from the Kitzmiller ruling and its weaknesses. We trust that fair-minded readers will see through such tactics. If this is the best defenders of Kitzmiller can muster, the shelf-life of the ruling may be short indeed.	FAVOR

Keep in mind that I did not find God out of some need to have an explanation..though I admit even as an atheist the concept sounded 'nice'. Nor was it a need to have this innate courage that comes from a world with reason, it was instead just a bonus.  It's a typical atheistic viewpoint that because the believer lacked the courage to live in a world without some form of security blanket.. that they invent God..on the contrary I came to the conclusion from looking at the evidence and from personal experiences.  The realization was unavoidable.  I was a happy person as an atheist.. -- though I can't describe the happiness that comes from knowing this isn't just a cosmic accident.As far as you question of 'what are the odds your God would be the way he is?'... I truly don't get the question... I'd say 1:1... but that would mean I knew what that meant in the first place?  It's awfully esoteric...  Do you mean what are the odds.. that if there were a God that he would want to have a creation? I'd figure 1:1... though it's rather hard for an imperfect being to imagine the wants of God - but it would seem any God by necessity would 'do' something.... not simply be content as an all encompassing complete and perfect whole... it would most likely 'create' in some form.. and what are the chances that this creation would likely be a reflection of himself in some form.. I'd say 1:1... when you create your creation reflects your character... does it not?  Now the next step becomes more conjectural... if you were to create this 'creation' would it be proper to force upon it absolute obedience?  I'd say that wouldn't be right.. I'd say you'd have to give it a right to dissent... matter of fact I'd give it a 1:1 chance that the only path would be free will.. and thus an imperfect creation - since you cannot have the option to do wrong without it.. so free will is another 1:1 chance.. Now we have a creation.. and it's flawed and yet shows similarities to it's creator.. we need to give this creation some purpose.. some form of reason to exist of sorts.. well I figure the obvious choice would be that the very purpose the creator would devise is a great mystery of 'where did I come from?'  .. in other words.. a beautiful mystery would be 'am I an accident.. or did I come from a creator?'... now THAT would be an ingenious idea... it would be like a game of hide and seek with my creation... It would be the ultimate question and the ultimate purpose... yes, I would give a 1:1 chance that this would be the perfect concept for my creation's 'fulfilling purpose'..  Now another problem... considering I am a perfect creator.. but have made an imperfect being... doomed to mistakes - and suffering.. and now he has a reason for life.. the search for the truth of me.. the creator.. I need to instill a reason for this search...a reward of sorts - since simply knowing I exist is not going to really provide meaning or even reason to search... I have it! the ultimate reward.. to return to me.. their perfect creator - ahhh... but there's a problem.. any reward means a punishment.. and that doesn't sound very benevolent of a perfect creator....hmm.. well then I will come to earth and live as them - in earthly form - yes! perfect idea... and even allow myself to die at their hands to show that I have suffered as they have! .. and I will make the rule that due to my own sacrifice... all that is necessary to return to me - the perfect creator is simply a heartfelt belief.. and an apology!! ingenious .. and perfectly simple!... in conclusion... I'd say if there were a God... which there is... there's a 1:1 chance he would be precisely as we perceive him.	FAVOR

The Bible was written in ancient Hebrew, not English, yes?  We are on the same page so far.  In ancient Hebrew, the word yom can mean day, as in 12 or 24 hour periods, or simply period of time.  Medieval scholars translated yom as day in English.  They did not have a reason not to, yet.  Now, consider that Yahweh was explaining this to a semi-literate group of ancient nomads, with no understanding of the cosmos or the world outside of their little society.  He couldn't explain things to them using complex scientific terms, so he simplified it.  In the beginning, God (the Hebrew word used here is Elohim, which is plural, and not Yahweh, but that's a different argument, so for now I'll just use the more accepted word, ""God"" rather than the correct translation of Gods) said, ""let there be light,"" and there was light.  Since there is no sound in space, the Big Bang would really be more like the Big Flash of LIGHT.  On Day 2, God creates the heavens.  From this Big Flash of Light, stars and planets and everything the ancient Hebrews could see in the heavens were created.  He then, on that same day, seperated the waters of the earth from the waters in the heavens.  Heavy volcanic activity in the early days of Earth's forming spewed a great deal of water vapor from the primordial ocean, forming an atmosphere.  So far, it fits together fairly well.  On Day 3, God seperates the water into one great basin, and dry land appears.  One basin of water and one spot of dry land sounds a lot like Pangea to me.  God also creates plants.  This is the one place where they don't seem to line up absolutely perfectly, as God doesn't create the ""lights in the sky,"" the sun, moon, and stars, until Day 4.  It could perhaps refer to simple, anaerobic, single celled organisms being formed before the smoke and debris from the volcanic activity cleared enough to allow the ""lights in the sky"" to show through.  Obviously, the ancient Hebrews would not have understood the concept of microscopic organisms, so this is a possibility.  On Day 5 God creates the sea creatures (which came first) and the birds (which, along with reptiles, followed).  On Day 6, God creates land animals, which are basically mammals, which also came next according to   evolution  .  Finally, God created man, which fits in perfectly with evolutionary theory.  The only differences are the complexity of terms and the lenght of the days, one caused by necessity and the other caused by poor translation.  The only other difference being that one came several thousand years before the other, but is basically the same thing.

Without taking up space analyzing the first two, addressing the third negates the relevance of the first two.In the Lemon v Kurtzman ruling, as in virtually all other Supreme Court cases, religion has not been defined, although in lower court cases, it has in some cases been defined in a narrow or broad sense, according to what the jurist(s) felt was needed to adjudicate a particular case. One of the main problems then, in applying the Lemon Test, is a proper interpretation of the term 'religion'.  Referring to excerpts from the Utah Law Review published by arn.org, this topic is addressed, with citations from relevant court cases.pg. 47  ""Though the courts have generally resisted formulating definitions ofreligion, the Ninth Circuit test articulated in Peloza v. Capistrano UnifiedSchool District226 and Alvarado v. City of San Jose227 stands as a clearexception to that rule.""  Similar to the Lemon Test, it consists of (3) qualifications for a motive to be religious.  I'll list those three, along with my interpretation.""First, a religion addresses fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters.""My take:  ID seeks empirical and statistical verifications/ falsifications, rather than to attempt to answer 'imponderable matters [questions].""Second, a religion is comprehensive in nature; it consists of a belief-system as opposed to an isolated teaching.""There is no established ""belief-system"" presented as evidence of design.""Third, a religion often can be recognized by the presence of certain formal and external signs.""Here is the clincher, quoting from pg. 46:  ""The third part of the test concerns the ""'presence of certain formal and external signs.'""  The court provided a list of such signs, including liturgy, clergy, and observance of holidays.  Obviously, design theory has none of these - no sacred texts; no ordained ministers, priests, or religious teachers; no design theory liturgies; no design theory holidays; and no institutional structures like those of religious groups.""If these prongs properly define 'religion', then Judge Jones erred in his decision.  ""Implying"" a God, does not a religion make.  A designer, design team, or designers over vast time would not need to constitute the role of an overseer, or an entity that conforms to prevailing monotheistic religions.  An appellate court ruling can be cited as a basis for later rulings, and in this case, to more accurately define 'religion' as referenced in Lemon v. Kurtzman, but not properly defined in that decision.  I eagerly await a subsequent court ruling based in-part on the above, as well as other relevant facts, to put this nonesense to rest.

A few of those words were when he claims that Casey Luskin misrepresents neo-Darwinism because, claiming that ÒAnyone familiar with evolutionary theory would quickly come to realize that evolutionary processes are not 'blind' or even 'unguided', in fact, the only aspect of evolutionary theory which comes close to this description is the concept of 'random' as used when describing mutations.Ó--But if you read CaseyÕs posts, it seems like he is familiar with evolutionary theory because he documents where textbooks and leading evolutionary biologists have described evolution in this fashion. For example, Luskin writes:ÒEven the widely-touted theistic evolutionary biologist Kenneth Miller has claimed in five editions of his highly popular high school biology textbooks that the implication of evolution is that it works Òwithout either plan or purposeÓ and is Òrandom and undirected.Ó(22)Ó--So in other words, Casey's ignorance is justifiable because he can find a textbook which fails to explain the concept correctly? Is that the full extent of your argument? In fact, are you aware that the author of the textbook accepted responsibility for the flawed definition and had it removed?As to Ayala, I fail to see your point since Ayala correctly describes the historical past--ÒSimilarly, in the prestigious scientific journal, Proceedings for the National Academy of Sciences, leading evolutionary biologist Francisco Ayala celebrates that ""DarwinÕs greatest accomplishmentÓ was to show that the origin of lifeÕs complexity Òcan be explained as the result of a natural process--natural selection--without any need to resort to a Creator or other external agent.""(13)--Without the need to resort to a Creator is what good science is all about. We all know how simplistically easy it is to assign our fears and ignorance to 'God's will', imagine our ancestors who saw God's hand in such issues as thunder and lightning or the stability of orbits of planets (Isaac Newton).

This has been tested and so far no evidence has been found that seems to contradict this, although some data suggested that mutations did arise in response to needs. However, on closer scrutiny, science discovered the 'SOS response' where organisms enter a stage of hypermutations which combined with the new environmental pressures allows mutations which confer a benefit to quickly spread. As to natural selection, science has tested that natural selection is a real process and has measured many instances of it. This brings us to the final issue, is natural selection and variation the only mechanism of evolution?

At the most simple and basic level, Darwinian biology is based upon the principle that favorable inheritable traits tend to increase in frequency in a population.  Everything else (the rise of life from a primordial goo, the development of men and chimpanzees from a common ancestor, etc.) is based upon this principle and our observations of nature, living or otherwise.  This principle offers immense, and verifiable, predictive power.  Theories derived from this principle have been proven false, but not once has the basis of natural selection ever been shown to be in error.Alternately, at the most simple and basic level, ID is based upon the principle that an outside creator has shaped the course of nature's development.

Period. No god, no gap filling.---That is incorrect as well, in fact in ID speak, complex means 'lacking scientific explanations', nothing more, nothing less. From this, ID conflates the meaning of complexity with what one has come to understand as complexity in science, which is not the same as how ID 'defines' it. Sneaky eh..But I can understand the levels of confusion. For instance, Highlander asserts that ID calculates the probability that something was designed by chance and then concludes 'design'. While this description only superficially matches the design inference, it shows the gap filling of ""not chance thus design"", nothing more, nothing less. Of course, ID has not done any non trivial calculations of probabilities and worse, it does not have to reject chance alone, which is often the simplest and still intractable calculation, but it also has to exclude regularity pathways. And yet, ask yourself, what calculations exist for the bacterial flagellum or any non trivial biological system?None I tell you. Surprised? I bet. This is but one reason ID has remained scientifically without content.--Highlander--I invite PvM to cite any leading ID theorist filling gaps in scientific knowledge with ID, as claimed above.

4270	creation	Some places do seem more open to honest debate over evolution rather than just trying to brainwash kids.  But this is not true everywhere.  Science should not be about brainwashing, but about seeking for the truth and if it leads to areas that scientists do not like, then so be it.  Another way to put it is that the purpose of science is not to support naturalism, whether it be merely methodological or not, but to search out the truth. Because we all know the answer may lay outside of methodological naturalism.  You might be fishing in a pond where there is no fish. You need open debate to be able to consider all solutions to the problem, including ones that might not fit within a scientists beloved worldview.While no one is recommending mandatory teaching of ID, there is rational reason to censor it either, except that it does not fit within the methodological naturalism of evolutionists. But since that methodological naturalism is just an arbitrary thing and rather recent at that, and since it cannot be proven that the answer to the origin of life actually can be found through methodological naturalism, then there is no reason to limit the debate to that worldview.  Seems rather stupid to do that if one is really after the truth.  If we knew for sure that the truth can be found in that view, that is a different story, but the best thing that can be said now is that scientists believe they will solve it some day.

If Intelligent Design made life on Earth, we would expect the designer to make all animals generalized in form and they would almost never go extinct. Evolution by natural selection is a blind process, taking no possible future events into account, that causes most lines of organisms to become more specialized over time. It does this so a species can occupy one ecological niche and keep other species out. When several species occupy the same ecological niche, competition between them eventually cause more specialization and/or causes most of the species to become extinct. Then a sudden change in the environment causes the remaining specialists to die out. That doesn't sound at all like an intelligent agent planning ahead."	AGAINST

4292	creation	"In science, testing a hypothesis or theory means deriving predictions from them. Thus, if I hypothesize that species have changed over time, then I predict that million-year-old fossils will indicate similarities with species today but with stark differences.  It follows, then, that if predictions cannot be derived from the supernatural, then neither can if-then arguments be developed against it.  For example, one could not logically argue that if God is all-good, then there would be no evil because this is deriving predictions from the supernatural.Nevertheless, every atheist who passionately opposes theism, religion, and ID has made these arguments.  In ""God: The Failed Hypothesis"", physicist Victor Stenger even proposed to develop a scientific model of God that he claimed could be used to test the God hypothesis.  Naturally, he found that his model did not hold and therefore God does not exist.  But did the scientific community chastise him for baiting-and switching, for pretending like science can make statements about God when it really can't?  Of course not!  This is because his conclusions concerning the hypothesis were in the negative.  What matters to atheist scientists is not the evidence, but whether the evidence can be interpreted as atheistic.  If it can, then the evidence is strong.  If it cannot, then it is weak.  These are my predictions using self-verification theory.  Let's see if my predictions are supported by evidence."	FAVOR

4294	creation	Why is it more reasonable to conclude common descent rather than common design from the similarity we see among species. I would argue that common design is far more reasonable. Here is why. This is a quote from the article and the full article can be found at the link below.ConclusionThe methodology for inferring common descent has broken down. Proponents of neo-Darwinian evolution are forced into reasoning that similarity implies common ancestry, except for when it doesnÕt. And when it doesnÕt, they appeal to all sorts of ad hoc rationalizations to save common ancestry. Tellingly, the one assumption and view that they are not willing to jettison is the overall assumption of common ancestry itself. This shows that evolutionists treat common descent in an unfalsifiable, and therefore unscientific and ideological, fashion.Meanwhile, as far as the data is concerned, the New Scientist article admits, ÒEver since Darwin the tree has been the unifying principle for understanding the history of life on Earth,Ó but because Òdifferent genes told contradictory evolutionary stories,Ó the notion of a tree of life is now quickly becoming a vision of the past Ñ as the article stated, itÕs being Òannihilated.Ó Perhaps the reason why different genes are telling Òdifferent evolutionary storiesÓ is because the genes have wholly different stories to tell, namely stories that indicate that all organisms are not genetically related. For those open-minded enough to consider it, common design is a viable alternative to common descent.	FAVOR

4297	creation	"I guess I must be old fashioned - but I do believe in real science. And I do recall that scientific experiments have never given evidence to suggest that spontaneous generation occurs. That being true, why in the world do so many in the scientific community hold so tightly to the notion that somehow, out of the ""primordial ooze"", given just the right mixture of mud, slime and chemicals, a living single cell organism just sort of ""poofed"" into existence, complete with DNA, and able to reproduce. And then, that single organism just kept on changing into a new species every so often, which ""evolved"" over time into all of the plants and animal that we see on the earth today. Now, that is a monstrous stretch of the imagination, not to mention totally non-scientific, and at best, pure speculation and more likely pure nonsense. There is no evidence to support this idea. So why is this theory of spontaneous generation at the very core of modern science today?  Years ago, without the tools of DNA analysis, and to appease those who funded certain ""scientific experiments and writing"", I can see how the evolution theory was ginned up, with the backing of some physical science and observation. It was a story easy to understand, and with the education of the day, it appeared believable. People said, ""Aaaaah. Now I can sleep at night, knowing how I got here.""I understand that without some kind of creation theory, there is a huge ""void"" in understanding our existence: How did we get here? Where did we come from? What about the dinosaurs? However, I was taught via science at a young age that ""just because you don't understand something or have evidence to prove it, you are not justified in making up a story to fill in the gaps, and then selling the idea as fact"".Very recent, extensive, highly sophisticated genetic studies have generated very compelling evidence to suggest that one species does not ""evolve"" or ""give rise"", over time to a separate species. While I believe that through ""natural selection"" and ""survival of the fittest"" a species in a given area may prosper or decline, and through that ""natural selection"" process, certain physical or other attributes become more common in a species in a given area, genetic evidence suggests that one species does not ""evolves"" into another species over time. The way I see it, Intelligent Design is just as viable a theory as spontaneous generation. In fact, even more believable. Why? Because:1.) I am 100% certain that I am really here. I can prove it. I am proof that a living human species really does exist. There is real, hard evidence. And there is solid evidence that a huge variety of different kinds of living things exist today on this earth and have existed in the past.2.) The Human species has a huge variability in physical and other attributes, but genetically we are all one species. We are not genetically linked to any other species on the planet.3.) Since spontaneous generation does not work, how do you account for the fact that there is life on this earth? It had to have happened some way. There is an explanation.4.) And since one species does not give rise to another different species, just how would you account for the incredible variety of living species on this earth today? There has to be some explanation.4.) The notion of Intelligent Design, with all of the possibilities that goes along with it (including the notion that perhaps that entity is possibly the same species as I am) seems very plausible to me, and not nearly as flakey as clinging to a non-scientific notion of spontaneous generation, or that one species gives rise to another different species over time and thereby gave rise to all of the varieties of species on this planet today. C'mon now. LetÕs actually be scientific about this! Intelligent Design has as much merit as the non-scientific evolution theory. Intelligent Design DOES NOT necessarily imply ""religion"". Where does that notion come from? It merely implies an intelligent life form ""could"" have had a hand (or paw, or branch) in populating this planet with the wide variety of living things we see today.So the way I see it, anyone with a sound scientific mind would consider it idiotic NOT to put forth Intelligent Design as a possibility."

If that is true then it seems that it will turn out to be a religious matter, because humans will automatically consider that force as god. Even if some force created us, humans shouldn't take for granted that it did it so that we worship it. He might did it for fun or more likely just because that`s what is does. Why do ants make colonies on the ground and gather in big teams? Because that`s what they do, to survive. Maybe the force needs to create things to survive and if that is the case by now it will probably have forgotten about this place a long long time ago since it will be far far away creating other things.

4300	creation	On Pandasthumb, Nick Matzke, whose contributions to Dover v Kitzmiller were instrumental in the stunning defeat of Intelligent Design and whose contributions to exposing the fallacies in Behe''s arguments as well as the extent of ignorance of science amongst ID proponents has caused much concern amongst ID proponents, so much that in general they have chosen to pretend, in a typical creationist fashion, that Matzke's arguments do not exist. In this example, Matzke shows how Luskin's attempts to rebut the Kitzmiller decision by exposing the scientific vacuity of ID, once again backfire in light of the current state of scientific knowledge.      Nick Matzke:Over on the opposingviews.com website, Casey Luskin of the DI tries to rebut the Kitzmiller decision by re-fighting BeheÕs spectacular implosion on the issue of the evolution of the vertebrate immune system. To review, in his 1996 book DarwinÕs Black Box, Behe claimed that:--Behe    ÒAs scientists we yearn to understand how this magnificent mechanism came to be, but the complexity of the system dooms all Darwinian explanations to frustruation.Ó (DarwinÕs Black Box, p. 139)    ÒWe can look high or we can look low, in books or in journals, but the result is the same. The scientific literature has no answers to the question of the origin of the immune system.Ó (DarwinÕs Black Box, p. 138)--(PvM: Note how these are the typical ID arguments against science, we do not know, thus designed)As the debate over Òirreducible complexityÓ developed in the next decade, the most detailed arguments would go basically like this:--    ID: Gradual evolution by natural selection canÕt produce IC structures because any structure missing a part would be nonfunctional    Evo: You are ignoring cooption of structures with different functions, which has a been a major feature of the evolutionary explanation of complex structures ever since the Origin of Species.    ID: Cooption explanations are too improbable.    Evo: Why?    ID: Because we say so.    Evo: But homology evidence shows that ÒIC systemsÓ lacking parts can still have other functions, and therefore your claim that structures missing parts would be nonfunctional is wrong    ID: OK well I donÕt have a comeback on that point, so instead I will claim that evolutionary cooption explanations arenÕt detailed & tested enough to satisfy me.    Evo: HereÕs a bunch of detailed & tested research papers on the evolution of system X.    ID: Not detailed enough. I need every single mutation & selection pressure before I admit that evolution produced this IC system rather than ID.--At this point the ID proponent has abandoned the original argument and therefore lost, even though he wonÕt admit it. Knowing all of this before the Kitzmiller trial, we devised ways to bring this point to the attention of the judge. The most famous example was the fabled Òimmune system crossÓ. A large amount of evidence was submitted that showed how the key feature of the vertebrate adaptive immune system, rearranging immune receptors (antibodies), evolved. Read the rest at        and educate yourself on the current status of science regarding the immune system and its evolution, and compare it with how ID 'explains' said immune system ('poof').

4319	creation	"The question is somewhat meaningless because you can believe that we were created by Design and still conclude that Intelligent Design, as proposed by the Discovery Institute and its fellows,  is a scientifically vacuous concept.For instance, many theistic evolutionists have no problem accepting both the design aspect as a faith element as well as science as providing the best explanation as to 'how'. The problem with ID is that it attempts to argue that the 'how', in the form of evolutionary theory, is somehow unable to explain this. And yet, the concept of a front loading design, is well within the paradigm of how ID approaches the issue and although ID proponents are quick to reject front loading since they have accepted an active participating deity on faith, the simple reality is that a God who set all in motion with the Big Bang, is as much part of the ID explanation as a God who is involved at every single moment in time and space. However, the former is much better supported by the evidence than the latter, for obvious reasons. To counter, ID proponents argue that evolutionary mechanisms lack purpose and are random, both of course are misleading and flawed arguments.First, the concept of purpose or teleology is a complex one, where purpose and function are easily confused and thus when we see the outcome of evolutionary processes that lead to function, one may be tempted to conflate this with purpose. Secondly, evolutionary theory is not random, although aspects of evolutionary theory involve neutral evolution, which involves changes in the genome which are near neutral and have no significant benefit or cost to the organism, evolutionary theory also includes the Darwinian concept of natural selection, which is by definition strongly non-random.ID proponents try to counter this with, yes but random or regular processes cannot explain complexity and information. Which is sort of tautological in ID speak since whenever such processes can explain a complex system with information, the complexity disappears by definition. Since ID proponents often conflate terminology like the concept of information, and attempt to argue that they really mean Shannon information, the simple observation that processes of variation and selection can in fact create information in the genome, in the Shannon sense, undermines any argument ID may have.So what have we determined so far? That scientists can both accept the religious concept of 'design' and still do science without accepting the flawed and scientifically vacuous approaches of ID. In fact, many such Christian scientists would argue that ID not just remains without scientific content but also that its theological claims undermine Christian faith. For instance, imagine, and not much imagination is needed given the recent research, that science finds a more detailed explanation of the bacterial flagellum, which is the cause celebre of the ID movement? This would mean that science has disproven ID, or has it? If it has disproven ID then indeed ID may have some scientific value but why would ID want to open up religious faith to an unreliable design inference? History has shown us plenty of examples where 'design' was falsified, even Newton flunked here. Of course, the reality is that ID is never placing the 'designer' at risk because it is not an argument for Design but rather an argument against evolutionary theory. So all it has done is made a claim that ""science cannot explain X"" and science has done what it does so well, show that the lack of explanation was based on our ignorance not some mystical 'design' explanation. In other words, ID's proposal is not one which proposed an alternative explanation, in fact, it is not better than ""science does not yet understand how X happened"", but rather proposes that a particular scientific hypothesis cannot explain 'X'. By careful bait and switch and a confusion that evidence against a particular evolutionary hypothesis should be counted as evidence in favor of design, ID manages to avoid a scientific formulation of design and still pretend that it proposes a scientifically relevant hypothesis in favor of design.Clever bunch but in the end, vacuous as well.So ""were we created by design""?

In other words, design is a place holder for our ignorance. Now ask yourself, does ID provide any positive explanations? Of course it does not. How otherwise does ID explain the bacterial flagellum? It provides no testable hypotheses beyond the negative claim that ""science cannot explain it"".Notice that ID remains scientifically vacuous, that is without merit, because it is unable to constrain its designer(s) which means that as an explanation it cannot even compete with the ""we don't know"" category.In other words, ID uses misleading terminology as well as bait and switch to make its claims. Ask yourself for instance: how does ID define 'information' and how to does it actually use this terminology? Information is the negative base two logarithm of the probability that a particular system can be explained by science. In other words, complexity or information, two terms which are used interchangeably by ID disappears when one can explain the system.

Yes, Margulis' claims were received with scepticism, and it was through hard scientific work that she managed to support her claims and science eventually accepted them. No similarities at all with ID which proposes nothing. As to the supply of the fittest, the issue of the 'arrival of the fittest' is of significant interest right now to science, what do you suggest has ID contributed to this?The answer is simple: Nothing""Self-organizing systems reflect constraints, as well as the appearance of randomness. It is significant that the final product itself is intelligent. That a stochastic process can be so fruitful is, itself, a testimony to the intelligence that directs such randomness. I don't know what the DI has contributed to this because I have not thouroughly examined their work.            If I had to take a theoretical stab at it, perhaps this might be one approach.  Look at intelligence and design where we can most likely identify it, It seems that in order to distinguish intelligence from ""dumb"" physical processes, one must first decide whether intelligence even exists in humans, and if so, what it is that distinguishes it from non-intelligence. Likewise for design. What characterizes or demonstrates premeditated intent from pure accident at the only level we can reliably distinguish it, the human level. As obvious as these questions sound, they are actually non-givens. Once that can be agreed upon, it would not be that hard (relatively speaking) to set up a prospective study with rapidly reproducing organisms showing detectable micro-evolution.  PvM>>""This is a misleading statement, there is no scientific issue of intelligence operative within both, in fact, science does allow God to be hidden behind these natural processes, it remains silent on such. Let's not pretend though that this is a scientific position.""Let's instead pretend that intelligence can never be detected? Is there a scientific issue that excludes the operation of intelligence? Your statement reflects your belief. You probably won't find it. Your methodology has infected your worldview. You are a good apologist for naturalism. I prefer to see reality, metaphysical and physical as related. Separate disciplines  are certainly fruitful but both science and theology teach us that a bigger picture adds a new dimension.

And why do ID proponents misrepresent science when describing for instance neo-Darwinism?--Casey Luskin writes:Proponents of neo-Darwinism contend that the information in life arose via purposeless, blind, and unguided processes. ID proponents contend that the information in life arose via purposeful, intelligently guided processes. Both claims are scientifically testable using scientific methods employed by standard historical sciences.--While I agree with Casey that science provides testable mechanisms to explain information in life, I disagree strongly with Casey's representation of neo-Darwinism where he conflates theological concepts such as purpose and where he equivocates on 'guided' and 'blind'. Anyone familiar with evolutionary theory would quickly come to realize that evolutionary processes are not 'blind' or even 'unguided', in fact, the only aspect of evolutionary theory which comes close to this description is the concept of 'random' as used when describing mutations. And all random really means is 'random with respect to the effect in a particular environment', in other words, mutations do no arise in response to environmental pressures immediately beneficial to said environment. Casey's suggestion that evolutionary processes are blind and unguided, ignore, as is quite common amongst Creationists, that evolutionary processes include ""natural selection"" where the environment both guides and where the outcome of the process is not 'blind' but rather leads to function. In fact, it is trivial to realize that natural selection is very similar to 'intelligent selection' where in the former case, information is transferred from the environment into the genome (as science has clearly shown to be the case), where the latter one involves the guidance of an intelligence responsible for said increase.So, now we have a situation where we know that both natural and intelligent processes can cause information to increase and we are left to establish which of the various explanations are the best. Since ID refuses to contribute any scientific explanation which positively identifies the processes, mechanisms etc, it remains unable to compete not just with evolutionary science but also with our ignorance ""we don't know hypothesis"".ID claims that information is best explained by intelligence and yet it provides no explanations.Weird eh?"

Why does it matter; NO; and NO.  2. NO.    The thing with people like us, people who believe in the Word of God is that we are dealing with a subject that goes beyond human beings.  The Bible (Scriptures or Torah) Is not necessarily the first book that we have ever read, but it stands out as one of our most favorite books.  If a man (or woman) says that he loves God and believes in Him as the Center of his life, then he will not have any problem using that book to help him support his viewpoint.  By the way, the Vatican was not the only branch of Christianity to select Biblical Books and support a particular viewpoint, some Protestant denominations were also guilty of deciding which Books would remain in the Bible nearly four centuries ago.  The Jewish people are guilty of omitting several Books from the Torah (Hebrew Bible), and some of these are included in today's Catholic Apocryphal editions of both Catholic and Protestant Bibles.   One of these Books, the Book of Jasher, is an authentic Scriptural writing that many scholars believe should have remained in today's Torahs and Bibles.  So much for that, I did not come here to split hairs with anyone.  As far as evidence to show that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God, you need look no further than the Bible itself.  Since God cannot lie, why then, would the Word of God tell lies?  The Bible (and Torah) are not Vatican-selected books, no matter how much some of us may want to believe that.  In fact, the Vatican's Bible is the Christian Bible PLUS the Apocrypha, so technically speaking, the Vatican's Bible is more comprehensive than the one used by Protestants.

Their literalism is a selective on.Moreover, Biblical scholarship has long noted that the days in Genesis 1(literal days consisting of evening and morning as per Jewish reckoning) are arranged in a poetic parallelism, with days 1-3 creating habitats that are then filled with life on days 4-6.The issue is not simply ignoring science.

4373	creation	"--But it's more than we don't understand' thus designed. It's specified complexity. Wherever we find specified complexity we find a designer. But for the theological implications this would be non-controversal.--That is yet another one of these ID claims which lack in much relevance. But for the sake of the reader, let's explore Jim's claim because otherwise the ID proponent may argue that I have not fully represented the ID argument.Specification is something that is, as is with so many aspects of ID, ill defined and even harder to measure but according to Dembski. first of all in biology, specification seems to be similar to 'function', which in evolution leads to an immediate problem namely that function is also an expected outcome of evolutionary processes.--Addressing the particular question regarding whether the bacterial flagellum is specified, Dembski confidently declares that, ÒSpecification is never a problem. The irreducibly complex systems we consider, particularly in biology, always satisfy independently given functional requirements.... For instance, in the case of the bacterial flagellum, humans developed outboard rotary motors well before they figured out that the flagellum was such a machine.ÓNFL, p. 289.The flagellum functions like an outboard rotary motor. The rotary outboard motor pattern represents a functional requirement independent of biological systems. Therefore, concludes Dembski, the flagellum is specified. --Source: Hopward van Till, ""E. Coli at the No Free Lunchroom""        In other words, in biology, the complexity part is established through our ignorance and the specification through function, so we can slightly revise our claim to state that in biology 'design' refers to science's ignorance about how a particular system with a function came around.Note that ID also does not provide any additional side hypotheses to explain from the ID perspective how such specification came about.In other words, outside biology, what is sufficient to identify some subjective function or pattern which is independent of the system and voila the foundation for a specification arises. Since we are very well aware of the fact that us humans are extremely capable of seeing 'design' in many aspects of life, it should not come as a surprise that under ID's approach the ""Old man in the mountain"" is as valid a design inference as Mount Rushmore, but of course likely to be wrong. Similarly, the patterns of circles or stable orbits combined with a lack of understanding of how science would explain this, caused Newton to infer 'design' for planetary orbits.Worse of course, the ID hypothesis does not only infer 'design' but provides no measures to show that its inference is more likely than 'we don't know', making the inference highly unreliable. And if we take Dembski's claim that if the design inference includes false positives, it would be useless, I am surprised why we are still talking about this."	AGAINST

It also doesn't mean God infected them both.I could easily see other reasons.. DNA is a code.. and follows rules in the manner it's formed.  If both species had encountered a disease it's not hard to believe the viral code would be in the same location.So called 'Junk' DNA is still quite a mystery... it was only recently that they began realizing it's not junk.  Matter of fact they are considering the possibility that the so called 'Junk DNA' may be the actual information for constructing the organism.. while the regular DNA is no more than the bricks and mortar to build with - It's possible junk DNA is more important.But since you shared your retrovirus story... I'll share a story with you.. How about the recent study on sea anemone's?     ''One of the big surprises of the anemone genome, says Swalla, is the discovery of blocks of DNA that have the same complement of genes as in the human genome. Individual genes may have swapped places, but often they have remained linked together despite hundreds of millions of years of evolution. . .  Moreover, the anemone genes look vertebratelike. They often are full of noncoding regions called introns, which are much less common in nematodes and fruit flies than in vertebrates. And more than 80% of the anemone introns are in the same places in humans. . . Finnerty and his graduate student James Sullivan also looked in the anemone genome for 283 human genes involved in a wide range of diseases. They will report in the July issue of Genome that they found 226. Moreover, in a few cases, such as the   breast cancer   gene BRCA2, the anemoneÕs version is more similar to the humanÕs than to the fruit flyÕs or to the nematodeÕs. . . This implies that even very ancient genomes were quite complex and contained most of the genes necessary to build todayÕs most sophisticated multicellular creatures. . . ''Interesting eh?  Why would the sea anemone have such complex DNA....?  As they put it.. it possibly has the genes capable of building today's most sophistacted multicellular creatures..  So then - did it always have them?  If it was a result of mutation.. why does it share so much in common with our own?The point is... there's more than meets the eye - and simply because you find a virus in chimps that is also in humans - this is not a proof of evolution from chimps... it just means (guess what) the same virus is in both.  Science is not   science   if it makes these kinds of assumptions.Many people like to say that we have 98% of the genes of the chimp..do you know we also have 78% of the genes of a BANANA!?does that lead you to believe we are related to a banana?question everything - science included.

4413	creation	The only thing I take issue with in this argument is the comments about Lenski's work with e. coli.  I am not a scientist, but I was able to read Lenski's paper and understand it.  The paper was SPECIFICALLY about how the mutation allowing e. coli to begin metabolizing citrase (the Cit+ mutation) was dependent on some other prior mutation(s) that opened the evolutionary pathway.  Lenski published without having identified the exact prior mutation, simply because of how exciting this result is.  Let me make this perfectly clear, in case you don't want to read Lenski's paper:  The evolution of the Cit+ e. coli required one or more mutations that may not have affected the survivability of the e. coli population.  This means that e. coli which was unable to eat citrates, mutated at least twice, changing it's chemical nanotechnology once, in a manner that may not have affected the survivability of the population, then later, a mutation allowed the bacteria to make use of an alternate food source.This experiment IS the 'smoking gun.'  We have observed evolution in the lab.  We can repeat it.  We can make predictions based on it.  Darwinian evolutionary science does not explain design, because it was never meant to.  It explains exactly what we see, in the fossil record, in our own DNA, and now, in the lab:  Small inheritable random variations accumulate over vast numbers of generations to modify organisms, raising the possibility of their gene's survival to the maximum.

Now I understand why you want to rely on the DI and the FTE's claims but this means that you are shielded from the facts.As I said the term creation and creationism have clear meanings which help explain why the terms were quickly and abruptly changed after the Edwards ruling.Since you believe in design inferences, what inference is one but to make here.In addition you have fallen victim of the claim that just because the FTE was denied to be heard, that the argument was not heard. From the actual ruling--Judge JonesAs Plaintiffs meticulously and effectively presented to the Court, Pandas went through many drafts, several of which were completed prior to and some after the Supreme Court's decision in Edwards , which held that the Constitution forbids teaching creationism as science. By comparing the pre and post Edwards drafts of Pandas, three astonishing points emerge: (1) the definition for creation science in early drafts is identical to the definition of ID; (2) cognates of the word creation (creationism and creationist), which appeared approximately 150 times were deliberately and systematically replaced with the phrase ID; and (3) the changes occurred shortly after the Supreme Court held that creation science is religious and cannot be taught in public school science classes in Edwards. ***This word substitution is telling, significant, and reveals that a purposeful change of words was effected without any corresponding change in content, which directly refutes FTE's argument that by merely disregarding the words ""creation"" and ""creationism,"" FTE expressly rejected creationism in Pandas.*** In early pre-Edwards drafts of Pandas, the term ""creation"" was defined as ""various forms of life that began abruptly through an intelligent agency with their distinctive features intact Ð fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc,"" the very same way in which ID is defined in the subsequent published versions. (P-560 at 210; P-1 at 2-13; P-562 at 2-14, P-652 at 2-15; P-6 at 99-100; P-11 at 99-100; P-856.2.). This definition was described by many witnesses for both parties, notably including defense experts Minnich and Fuller, as ""special creation"" of kinds of animals, an inherently religious and creationist concept. (28:85-86  (Fuller); Minnich Dep. at 34, May 26, 2005; Trial Tr. vol. 1, Miller Test., 141-42, Sept. 26, 2005; 9:10 (Haught); Trial Tr. vol. 33, Bonsell Test., 54-56, Oct. 31, 2005). Professor Behe's assertion that this passage was merely a description of appearances in the fossil record is illogical and defies the weight of the evidence that the passage is a conclusion about how life began based upon an interpretation of the fossil record, which is reinforced by the content of drafts of Pandas.---In other words, the terms as defined clearly mirrored what we know as 'creationism' and that it was an inherently religious concept. Even the expert witnesses for the defense, Minnich and Fuller had to admit this. Behe attempted to 'explain' away the evidence but was ruled to be illogical and the weight of the evidence presented.Thus the court concluded based on the evidence presented that--The weight of the evidence clearly demonstrates, as noted, that the systemic change from ""creation"" to ""intelligent design"" occurred sometime in 1987, after the Supreme Court's important Edwards decision. This compelling evidence strongly supports Plaintiffs' assertion that ID is creationism re-labeled. Importantly, the objective observer, whether adult or child, would conclude from the fact that Pandas posits a master intellect that the intelligent designer is God.--Such is the danger of relying on a biased set of documents from the publishers of Pandas and the Discovery Institute. So let's see at what the book 'argues'--The book argues that the origin of new organisms is ""in an immaterial cause: in a blueprint, a plan, a pattern, devised by an intelligent agent.""--Clearly supernatural since common intelligent designers do not require immaterial causes. In addition, the objections to evolutionary theory mirror the same flawed criticisms of earlier religious opposition. So no wonder that reviewers such as Kevin Padian, a biologist at University of California Berkeley .. called it ""a wholesale distortion of modern biology.--Of PandasCreation means that the various forms of life began abruptly through the agency of an intelligent creator with their distinctive features already intact.

It does not ban the statute from having a religious purpose, it merely requires a secular one. Does teaching/discussing ID have a secular purpose? It has many. For example, discussing ID can help students expand horizons. It teaches students to think critically. There are many others. I remember in the eighth grade, when we had to learn about the Moon Hoax as a part of science class. Whether it was right or wrong, whether it was wise to teach it, is all up for debate. But it IS constitutional to discuss it in science class.--That is exactly what the DI tried to argue, that ID has some secular purpose. But SChen forgot an important part 'that is not a sham', and thus while talking about ID as a bad example of science is hardly unconstitutional or enforcable, ID itself is not to be discussed as part of the curriculum in a science class.ID has NO secular purposes that are not shams, the judge realized this and ruled appropriately.

4444	creation	I believe arguments from the opposing camps that say 'it looks like it was designed, so it must have been designed' and 'natural selection could have produced it, so we believe natural selection did produce it' are not going to lead to resolution of this issue.The real question is - Is there any direct evidence that a particular feature actually was designed, or on the other hand, direct evidence that it arose through natural selection? This is clearly a very difficult question or to answer when the events took place long ago (pace YECs)On the ID side, I'm not aware of any evidence that any feature of any organism actually was designed. This would require evidence that a) designers existed b) they visited earth and c) they intervened in the modification of life.On the evolution by natural selection side, likewise I'm not aware if there is any evidence that a significant new feature, such as the human brain, actually did evolve this way. I think at the moment it's impossible to demonstrate either of these with direct evidence. So for me the next question is - in the absence of direct evidence either way, is it possible to say whether or not ID has merit?I think it is. This is because, as I understand it, ID makes no proposals as to the nature of the designers, when and how they designed life, why they don't appear to be around today, and what their own origin was. This means it is not really a theory, more a kind of problem statement.For evolution by natural selection, there is a proposed mechanism, which has been proven to work on small scale changes (point mutations). Other mechanisms are known that can modify the genome on a larger scale. Natural selection therefore doesn't have the blank spaces that ID does, and in my view has the right to be called a theory.

Is it not remarkable how so many tribes managed to find themselves located at exactly the spots where rivers ran into oceans, enabling not only an inflow of fresh water but also the protection by a moderated climate. Even more remarkable is how the ocean would provide for important sources of protein (fish etc) and enable trade with other tribes.What a the chances that life would thrive at exactly these places... Other than these nasty tsunamis and hurricanes...Thus we start to understand the Goldilocks aspect better. In fact, while the porridge, bed and chair of the child bear was exactly the right size for the teenager who intruded, other 'guests' would have found the father or mother bear's porridge etc much more to their likings.In other words, we observers are biased to be in locations in which our existence is not just possible but also likely given the environment.Some may call this an enigma others just observe the logic behind such a correlation. Simple really and so if the anti-copernicans are interested in presenting their thesis and predictions, then fine. Pointing at some quotes and some yet to be understood data hardly seems sufficient for such a position.Note that as is the case with science, there may be more to this coincidence but its up to those proposing it to present their evidence and make their case.That's how real science is done, and that's why ID continues to fail to be scientifically relevant.

4464	creation	"First of all, I have no ""presupposed attitude."" I was a young earth creationist like yourself when I was first introduced to these issues. If anything, that was my presupposed attitude, and it took years for me to overcome it. If you think original sin, substitutionary atonement, and the trinity are obvious when reading the scripture ""as a whole,"" then I highly suggest that you read the works of Christians who would disagree with you. I particularly enjoyed Tom Harpur.I don't know how better to state this: The theory of evolution is the most extensively verified theory of science outside the mathematical precision of physics. No other theory has the same extent of converging, collaborative evidence from such a diversity of scientific disciplines over the past century. Paleontology, anatomy, biochemistry, genetics, medicine, psychology, sociology, geology, astronomy, and even computer science are just a few examples of the fields independently producing volumes of observations that validate the theory of evolution.As an example, consider human retroviruses. An endogenous retrovirus is a virus that infects gametes and becomes part of the genetic makeup of a species. These fragments of DNA make up about eight percent of the human genetic code, and thousands of them are in the exact same locations in chimpanzees. If chimpanzees and humans were created separately then the probability that the same viruses would infect the same locations in our genetic codes is near impossible. The only two viable explanations are that (1) we share a common ancestral population with chimpanzees or (2) the creator pre-infected both species with the same viruses in the same genetic locations. Is the second explanation compatible with your god or your notion of original sin?      That is just one example of thousands from genetics alone that validate the theory of evolution. Evolution is not irrefutable, but it has an incalculably high probability of being correct based on our observations. There is no controversy among professionals: evolution happened. The only disagreement that still exist are over the details.Ambiogenesis is a separate theory because Darwin's theory never dealt with the first life. His theory presupposed the existence of life to explain the development of biodiversity. God may have created the first life, and the theory of evolution would still be correct. Ambiogenesis is an area of ongoing research complicated by the fact that the earliest life did not fossilize, but it appears increasingly likely that the earliest self-replicating molecules formed naturally. Most of the molecules required by the simplest cells are naturally occurring.You suggested a conspiracy theory to force the theory of evolution into schools. There are thousands of scientists all over the globe from every creed, ethnicity, and nation relying upon the theory in their daily work. To suggest that all these individuals are complicit in a global conspiracy to force the theory onto school children is ludicrous.

It does help to read the actual paper, which is btw available to anyone interested.You seem to call this a 'prejudice' but that is understandable since you seem to rely on a yet to be defined 'hypothetical model' which you believe explains the observations better, although lacking the details such a claim has to be dismissed as lacking in specifics.The reason to formulate the 'anthropic principles' was well described by Carter--... that far from being evidence in favour of exotic theories these coincidences should rather be considered as confirming 'conventional' (General Relativistic Big Bang) physics and cosmology which could in principle have been used to predict them all in advance of their observation.--As long as one uses the anthropic principles which I described in more detail.Others have come to the similar, reasonable conclusion--The modern era of anthropic reasoning dawned quite recently, with a series of papers by Brandon Carter, another cosmologist. Carter coined the term Òanthropic principleÓ in 1974, clearly intending it to convey some useful guidance about how to reason under observation selection effects. We shall later look at some examples of how he applied his methodological ideas to both physics and biology. While Carter himself evidently knew how to apply his principle to get interesting results, he unfortunately did not manage to explain it well enough to enable all his followers to do the same.--Source:  Nick Bostrom        	AGAINST

Jim--Science will never be able to do so and if you allow others to define this as if it has happened then you are granting these atheists a lot of power. If ID is just about reminding us of this then surely it has far less of a relevance as a scientific contributor than most imagine it does.--JimThis is the view that life is the result of random, purposeless arrangements of molecules shaped by natural selection. Where does God come in? Little or no room for God in this interpretation. Hence if you believe that you can be an atheist. If it is true you are almost certainly right in your belief.--Well, atheists have the advantage that they can incorporate science easily as it does not interfere with their philosophical position, but that does not mean that Christians cannot reconcile the fact of evolution, the mechanisms of evolution with the concept of a caring God. In other words, accepting evolution does not force you either way, although I agree that given the position of some Christians, science is in fact at odds with faith.

What science does is, given these observations, to propose a hypothesis to explain the coincidence. You claim that you have provided a 'falsifiable prediction' but so far the prediction at best is ad hoc, not surprisingly perhaps because there appears to be a lacking 'hypothesis' to support your 'prediction'.--IslandI gave supported examples for how the predictive capabilities of the Goldilocks Enigma lie in the balance between diametrically opposing runaway tendencies .--A meaningless statement really. You referred to the work by Ryals (aka island) who made some pretty ad hoc claims. But perhaps, I may not fully understand your position which seems to be based mostly on perusing some literature which you believe shows non-copernican tendencies and then claim 'see...'. What I see is how science is exploring a large variety of plausible explanations for the observations and is not jumping to conclusions without a good supporting base of hypotheses and data. Which is why most suggest that we basically do not know how to explain the correlations and alignment of the data in WMAP, especially now that science has found how these are lacking in other data from MASS2. In fact, the author suggests that the tools to detect these anomalies may be lacking. In other words, --A better approach to the search for non-Gaussianity in the CMB data may be through more theoretically motivated searches. With blind searches we fall into the trap that one can always Þnd a non-Gaussian signal in a map, even if it is consistent with Gaussianity. Thus general non-Gaussian detections can easily be dismissed. However, blind searches have the advantage of scope, and can detect the signatures of new physics. In either case, we can still improve on ourcurrent investigations. The wealth of statistics employed in the literature are not independent, but the degeneracies and correlations are not clear.--That by itself should be sufficient a warning to not conclude that the WMAP data _shows_ that we are at the center of the universe. At best one may argue that it is consistent with such, although even that one lacks in sufficient theoretical evidence. In other words, what is missing is showing that this is exactly a prediction or outcome of the model which Island prefers. Although he has hinted at the Einstein model, it is far from clear that this is the one he has in mind as specifics seem to be largely lacking.In order to do some real science, I suggest that Island presents his preferred model, without which it is impossible to evaluate his claims, and then shows that the model indeed predicts or explains the observed correlations and alignments.That's what science would do."

4501	creation	"Michael Behe may be best known for his book ""Darwin's Black Box"" and to a lesser extent its sequel ""The Edge of evolution"". Both books attempt to show that there limits (edges) to evolutionary theory which cannot be crossed.Let's first point out that much of Behe's argument is not with evolutionary theory itself but a component of said theory, namely natural selection. For instance, his Irreducible Complexity argument relies on the (erroneous) claim that processes of variation and selection (aka Darwinian processes) are unable to explain systems which are 'irreducibly complex (IC)"". In order to understand why Behe is wrong, one need not look further than         First of all the problem of IC systems and its solution was pointed out by a Nobel Prize winner and evolutionary scientist almost a century ago (        )Muller, H. J. (1918) ""Genetic variability, twin hybrids and constant hybrids, in a case of balanced lethal factors."" Genetics 3:422-499. Muller, H. J. (1939) ""Reversibility in evolution considered from the standpoint of genetics."" Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society 14:261-280. ---    ""... thus a complicated machine was gradually built up whose effective working was dependent upon the interlocking action of very numerous different elementary parts or factors, and many of the characters and factors which, when new, were originally merely an asset finally became necessary because other necessary characters and factors had subsequently become changed so as to be dependent on the former. It must result, in consequence, that a dropping out of, or even a slight change in any one of these parts is very likely to disturb fatally the whole machinery; for this reason we should expect very many, if not most, mutations to result in lethal factors ...""    Muller 1918 pp. 463-464. (emphasis in the original)        ""... an embryological or physiological process or structure newly arisen by gene mutation, after becoming once established (with or without the aid of selection), later takes more and more part in the whole complex interplay of vital processes. For still further mutations that arise are now allowed to stay if only they work in harmony with all genes that are already present, and, of these further mutations, some will naturally depend, for their proper working, on the new process or structure under consideration. Being thus finally woven, as it were, into the most intimate fabric of the organism, the once novel character can no longer be withdrawn with impunity, and may have become vitally necessary.""    Muller 1939 pp. 271-272.---However, Keith Robison described a very similar example where simple evolutionary processes lead to a system which is IC  (        )--So, duplication plus a loss of function, plus one of two different loss-of-function mutations can convert a single step pathway into a two step cascade. The initial  steps are neutral, neither advantageous nor disadvantageous. Such neutral mutations occur regularly. The final step locks in the cascade.--ID's objections to the above scenario are that it involves neutral steps and are thus not 'Darwinian' in nature, but like Darwin, evolutionary science accepts that selection is but one of various processes and the importance of neutrality on evolution has been historically underestimated.Dembski, understanding one of Behe's flaws redefined IC to read--    A system performing a given basic function is irreducibly complex if it includes a set of well-matched, mutually interacting, nonarbitrarily individuated parts such that each part in the set is indispensable to maintaining the system's basic, and therefore original, function. The set of these indispensable parts is known as the irreducible core of the system. (No Free Lunch, 285)--Note the addition of 'original function', this prevents the most common pathways in evolution to be irrelevant to explaining IC systems, but now Dembski has to show that indeed, original function was maintained in any particular system. While this may have temporarily saved Behe's original fomulation, it has merely defined IC systems to be something which is much harder to establish as it involves a historical component of 'original function'."

4508	creation	Abraham, Isaac and Jacob belonged to different tribes and were not related, but the stories grew together into a collection and the persons were tied together as members of the same family. Isaac became son of Abraham, with Esau and Jacob becoming IsaacÕs sons.  And Jacob became equipped with twelve sons, so the twelve tribes should be equal.Into this storytelling old adventure stories also were incorporated, and they were told as being as credible as the heroic epics. The motif in the story about Joseph and the wife of Potiphar for instance is copied from the Egyptian fairytale ÒThe two BrothersÓ.  Of old an enmity existed between the semi-nomadic sheepherders and the Bedouins. In the production of myths, the sheepherders therefore made a story about how the Bedouins were descendants of a farmer that had fled because of murdering his brother. We recognize the story about Cain and Abel. They then equipped Adam and Eve with a third son, Set, who was made god-fearing and straight enough to be the one they themselves descended from.In Canaan, drought was the enemy; high summer was the death of nature. But with autumn the rains came, and nature awakened to life again.  The creation myth of the Canaanites therefore speaks of the dry, arid land that their God bless with rain and wells breaking forth. Thus life was created on Earth. Contrary to that, in Babylon floods were the dangerous problem.Their creation myth, that also became known by the Israelites and incorporated into their folklore, therefore tells that it began with waters all over, then with land rising out of the water. The two creation myths are placed side by side in the bible and they are both equally true and believable.Most likely, people in those times believed those stories as more than just stories. For them, it was real history that earth and heavens, man and animals suddenly were created. They were aware of the existence of other peoples with other gods, but they were not part of their own history and how they might have been created was of no concern to them. So therefore, there was no problem for Cain to find a wife. Most of the myths in Genesis are older than the immigration of the Israelites. They had been part of the tribal traditions for a long time. Their concept of God also was quite different. The patriarchs knew gods like El-sjaddai and Elohim, and neither Abram, Isaac or Jacob knew anything about MosesÕ new creation, Yahweh. According to 2. Mos. 3, Moses asked the new god what he should be called, and the god replied: ÒI am who I am.Ó The story leaves no doubt that it is a new, hitherto unknown god that is being introduced, but history has made him identical with the god of the patriarchÕs. While they had been more like family- or tribal gods, this new god was made the god of the Israeli nation, and theirs only. And in later history telling he became the god of the ancient myths and fairytales.	AGAINST

In other words, ID is a placeholder where, lacking sufficient explanations, it argues, nay insists that we call it 'design' just because it looks designed. The overlap with Paley should be self evident but things get worse when ID proponents attempt to validate the approach by claiming that this is how science works.In fact, this is NOT how science works, as can be trivially shown by noticing that ID refuses to constrain its designer by such scientific approaches as used in criminology which include means, motives, opportunity, as well as eye witnesses, physical evidence and circumstantial evidences. No, ID cannot rely on such because, by relying on what science has come to identify as 'rarefied' design, it has effectively chosen an approach which cannot even compete with 'we don't know' as it provides no positive hypotheses.So let's expose the scientific vacuity of ID once again:How does ID explain the genetic code/bacterial flagella and how does its 'explanation' compares to how science explains these?The lack of explanations from ID, combined with its silly name calling, should be sufficient evidence of its scientific vacuity.

By gosh, he almost sounds like a scientist when he says that ""The form of information which reliably indicates design is generally called 'specified complexity' or 'complex and specified information,' "" whatever the hell that means. Apparently, all it means is that if a process with many components (therefore ""complex"") behaves so as to head coherently in a single direction (therefore ""specified""), then it must be the result of   intelligent design  . OK, then try this one.Get a hundred people to each throw a handfull of sand, perhaps a thousand grains per handfull (that's ""complex""), at a wall. Watch to see what happens. If all of the 100,000 grains reverse direction when they hit the wall and then curve downward and end up on the floor (that's ""specified""), with absolutely no communication among them, then surely they must have been guided by an intelligent designer.Ah, but Mr. Luskin would object that the analogy is irrelevant, because while there was some random component to the movement of the various grains of sand, in the final analysis they were all subject to the overriding influence of gravity, and that's why they moved in a similar way and ended up on the floor. That's true. And in the same way, the various organisms and their various organs have shown significant randomness throughout their evolution, but in the final analysis, they were all subject to the overriding influence of natural selection and the survival of the fittest. The least fit died; the most fit survived and contributed their genes to the next generation. The grains of sand all ended up on the floor without any conscious intention of going there, just because they were all influenced by gravity. In the same way, all those organisms kept on improving their fitness without any intention on anyone's part, just because those who were most fit survived and reproduced while the least fit died, as any reasonable person would expect.

High probability then it was caused by a regularity2. Intermediate probability then it was caused by chance3. Small probability: either chance or design depending on the existence of a ""specification""Specification is a somewhat tricky concept but according to Dembski, function in biology would be a sufficient specification. Ironically, function is also the outcome of the process of natural selection and thus whether the low probability score was caused by our ignorance or because of design is why the design inference remains without content, in case of rarefied design.Rarefied design: Rarefied design inferences tell us nothing that can be inductively generalized.The authors observe ""There is an in-principle difference between rarefied and ordinary design inferences, based on the background knowledge available about ordinary, but not rarefied, design agencies.""This is an important observation because it helps us understand why historical sciences can accurately apply 'design inferences' while ID remains scientifically without content.

For organisms with very simple and efficient genomes well adapted to a particular environment that change will likely be a negative one in their ancestral environment. Kudos on dragging out the statistical fallacies in Mr. Behe's most recent popular work. I find your reference to Simon work particularly fascinating.

4550	creation	Look at it like this.... first off, words are metaphors - they are symbols of an object.. some more exact than others.  From this starting point we can see that language always only approximates an idea.. language is not math.From here we can see that the Bible already is going to not have any sort of 100% exact meaning.. because language itself is always open to interpretation.  Intent can NOT be 100% verified... it's simply not possible.  Any line I write is up to individual interpretation -- it's unavoidable.When the Bible says the inhabitants of the earth are to God like grasshoppers... well, that is a metaphor - and yes, the Bible is full of them.  Does that mean it isn't true? Not at all.. but the poetic nature of the statement is unavoidable.This problem of language, it's nature, is part of why we debate like this... It's semantics.. When I said a 'full understanding' of the Bible is necessary.... it suffers from the same problems any statement made in a verbal language does - it suffers from not being 'completely correct'.  You can't technically have a 'full understanding' of anything... No one has a full understanding of chemistry.. or even english.. or even gravity. - Your questioning of my phrase 'full understanding' gives a perfect example of the problems with interpreting the Bible or any book.   Language is faulty.. there is no 'true' definition for any word.... especially since it is only defined by other words - which in turn are defined by other words......Given this concept we can see that the meaning of anything isn't precise - and the Bible will always be the subject of interpretation.  Parables and the like can be considered literally 'true' but yet metaphors.  If I say that stars are like pin pricks in the curtain of night... the statement is true - but entirely metaphor... and given another viewpoint one could say false as well - -since one could argue they are nothing 'like' pin-pricks in a curtain.Do you see my point?  People can see the Bible as literally true - and still understand it is full of metaphors.  The question remains.. which are true metaphors.. and which are meant without poetics.By reading the Bible for understanding it helps you determine which parts are meant in a poetic sense and which is meant as metaphor.  Can anyone insist that they are correct in their interpretation? nope.  But with study.. people tend to have better understanding - that's all I mean.Can someone 'prove' the Bible means a literal 6 day creation.. nope.  like all of language.. it's up to opinion.  I stated my opinion.. that it appears a literal 6 days was the intent - I cited the repetitive use of the words 'evening and morning' as one reason for my opinion - but it's still opinion and cannot be 'proven'.And as far as your question about what merit the Bible has to non-Christians.... well obviously little - else they would be Christians =)	FAVOR

4552	creation	--Jay--That means that anyone who dares speak of purpose or design within science or when discussing scientific evidence ceases to be a scientist.---And yet ID also claims that historical sciences deal succesfully in detecting design, so in fact purpose or design can, as ID argues, be established using methodological naturalism. So why is ID different? Because they want to replace or extend MN by something 'supernatural', however since the supernatural lacks as an explanation, they have to confuse the issue by making flawed claims about science rejecting design and purpose at all cost.Jay's argument fails even worse when discussing Newton or Keppler stating--Methodological naturalism, for instance, would exclude most of the founders of modern science, including Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton. That should strike you as fishy.--And yet, these people were following methodological naturalism, except in the case when Newton believed that his inability to understand the stability of orbits of planets was best explained by an Intelligent Designer interfering regularly to correct their orbits. It took half a decade or so for LaPlace to correct this flawed 'design inference'.Openmindedness does not mean that one should accept any argument that's more closer to a concept better know as gullibility. Is there evidence for ID in nature. Surely ID does not really tell, all they do is call our ignorance 'design' and then conflate the terminology with how people more commonly interpret this terminology. Bait and switch. Lacking any foundation that constrains their hypothesis, ID is doomed to scientific irrelevance, and anyone openminded would have to admit this. In fact, several ID proponents have admitted to the lack of a foundation for ID.So it is clear that Jay is wrong to argue that science rejects design a-priori, After all, the Discovery Institute argues that ID must be science because other sciences also infer design. So, for science to reject ID, it must be because it fails to contribute. Not because it is wrong, it is not even that, it's just vacuous.Is intelligent design science? Does it matter? ID lacks any non trivial scientific contribution, other than perhaps making the flawed claim that science and methodological naturalism somehow deny purpose and design or that MN would reject Newton and Keppler. Anyone familiar with these people would realize that they did not let their faith distort their science, although in the case of Newton he did show why a design inference based on ignorance is unreliable.We can only thank Newton for his contributions to science while also showing us why ID is doomed to remain scientifically vacuous.

Does this mean that since ID's flagellum has been shown to be plausibly evolved that somehow design and the designer have been falsified? Does the fact that regularity and chance processes, contrary to claims by ID proponents, can in fact increase information and complexity mean that ID has been falsified and that the 'designer is dead'? Of course not. At best it means that ID proponents were wrong in making their claims about science and since they never placed the concept of design at risk, ID remains scientifically without content.If you feel that I have missed other points worth addressing, please let me know.

IÕm trying to set the context so I can give a full and complete answer to your question.

When this was first pointed out to me, the third edition of this book was in print, I immediately went to Joe, I said Joe, I think this is a bad idea, I said I think this is a non-scientific statement, I think it will mislead students. Joe agreed. We immediately took it out of the book, and thatÕs why I emphasized that it did not appear in subsequent editions. So what youÕre looking at, sir, is a mistake.(Transcript of Testimony of Kenneth Miller, Day 2 of Kitzmiller Trial (Sept. 27, 2005), pgs. 4-8.)--In the end the big difference is simple: ID has no scientific foundations, science does, in other words, there exists a valid secular purpose and the fact that some evolutionists are Christians and others are not is of no relevance.However, ID's history combined with its lack of content has doomed it.

The research discussed in this book leads to the conclusion that mutations are not all accidents and that mutations are not always random. Our genomes, and those of other life forms, have evolved mechanisms that create different kinds of mutations in their DNA, and they reuse and adapt useful pieces of DNA, even to the point that there are genomic 'interchangeable parts.'Biochemical mechanisms can arise that tend to focus genetic variation, resulting in ""hot spots"" of genetic change at certain places in the genome.""---In a review of ""Darwin In the Genome: Molecular Strategies in Biological Evolution"" by Lynn CaporaleIndeed, to understand what science means by 'random' when it applies to evolutionary theory, one has to do more than claim that random must mean without pattern. Such a confusion, which could have laid to rest quickly, can cause one to hold to a flawed assumption that evolution is 'random', when all evolutionary theory (not necessarily Darwinism) observes that the source of variation is 'random' with respect to its immediate effects given an environment.Of course, that evolutionary processes themselves can improve mechanisms of variations, or that variation comes in hot spots, is nothing new, let alone at odds with how science uses the term 'random' when it comes to evolution."

There are some great studies done to show that evolution is happening and that we have adapted to our surroundings.  But to me, that does not support evolution.  Evolution is a broad topic.  I have done quite a bit of research and have found that people who are looking for answers will find things to support their belief.  There is nothing that proves evolution 100%.  Sure there are some great scientists and some very smart people that have made claims based on their research that evolution is real.  But this is like someone wanting something so bad that they will go to any length to find evidence to support their belief.  Nobody wants to prove themselves wrong, so i think that the majority of evolutionists will search for things to back themselves up.  That is too easy and comfortable.  Until I see some absolute evidence that supports evolution, rather than one's theory, then i have to conclude that it is wrong and that we are part of something more powerful than we could ever fathom.  Besides, has evolution ever turned someones life around?  Has evolution ever impacted someone so much that they make steps in their life to improve and influence people in a positive and loving way?

4573	creation	I can see how it would be interpreted as a contradiction.. but it really isn'tFirst off the statement 'And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made'  only at first appears that he took 7 days... just read the sentence again - he rested on the seventh day... just the same as in the other verse... no conflict - it's just the wording of 'On the seventh day God finished his work'..    If you worked 6 days of the week - on the seventh you would have finished your work...  The creation was a week - with the last day resting.. same in both.as far as verse 2 it is an entirely different type of story...It's mainly dealing with the creation of Adam but also the naming of the various generations of   animals   and plants by him.  Verse 2 is not an actual step by step story the way the first verse is -- you can tell by the wording itself2:4 begins'These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens'He's telling us right off the bat.. that what we have is a telling of the generations of animals and also man that was created 'in the day that the lord made the earth and the heavens'....The 'creation of the heavens and earth' was the entire process... not day 1.....same as it says 'in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'  in verse 1..this is not simply the first day.. but an introduction to the process.  Although I had never considered the interpretation you are describing.. it seems you are saying that it contradicts because of the use of the word 'day'?  Just like in hebrew - our word day has a double meaning.. it can either mean a time.. or an actual day - like the phrase 'back in the day' =)  What separates this day from the days in verse 1 is most importantly the lack of the mention of 'evening and morning'.But back to the point - Verse 2 is a telling of how he created the animals and also man.  Let's look at the verse once more - ' These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.'As I said... this part is not a 'step by step' of creation.. it is just as it says 'the generations in the day that God made them (heaven, earth, plant and herb)'  It is a special verse devoted entirely to the telling of the process of making man - and later Adam naming the animals.  The purpose of this verse in not to simply retell the creation story a second time (there would be no point to that).With that in mind.. this is why the statement of God 'having not caused it to rain upon the earth' is not an issue... simply because this is not a retelling of a creation.. but used to express a different idea.. I'll try to state it the verse in more of a plain english.. rather than Bible english -' This is the story of the making of all the living things on the Earth (generations), and how it occurred ... to witness the process we return to the point just before their making - the point before God had made it rain upon the Earth and before there were a man to work the ground.'The supposed 'contradiction' arises when you assume that 'God not having caused it to rain' is in chronological order to Genesis 1.. or that this is a step by step piece.  It is an introduction to Genesis 2 in the same way that 'In the beginning..' is the introduction piece for Genesis 1.That is the way it reads for me... and believe me - it was difficult for me to try to put this into words for you.....understanding the verse and explaining it are two entirely different things - but this is the interpretation I've always got from this verse.. In genesis 1 we tell the story of how it all was created - in Genesis 2 we go back a step.. and tell the story of animals and man.  The verse serves to separate Adam from all the other beasts and make clear man's importance.Hey... I'm no Bible scholar....

But he asks for it. Argument to the best explanation! Look: there is a great deal we do not know about this world of ours, but what is beautiful about science is that its practitioners do not panic and say ""cripes! we don't understand this, so we must grab something quick - attribute it to the intelligent designing activity of Fred (or Zeus or the Tooth Fairy or any arbitrary supernatural agency given ad hoc powers suitable to the task) because we can't at present think of a better explanation."" They do not make a hasty grab for a lousy ""best explanation"" because they have serious thoughts about the kind of thing that can count as such. Instead of quick ad hoc fixes, they live with the open-ended nature of scientific enquiry, hypothesising and testing, trying to work things out rationally and conservatively on the basis of what is so far well-attested and secure. What looks like having a chance of being both an ""explanation"" and the ""best"" in a specific case turns on there being a well-disciplined idea of ""best"" for that specific case. But an hypothesis has no hope of becoming the best explanation (until a better comes along) unless it survives testing, is specific, and is consistent and conservative with respect to much else that is secure. This is a far cry from the gestural ""best explanation"" move that ID theorists attempt, which - and note this carefully - does not restrict itself to individual puzzles only, but applies to Life, the Universe and Everything. It has to, at risk of incoherence; and yet by doing so, it collapses into incoherence.--Well said. Seems that many people have fallen victim of the erroneous claim that ID is an inference to the best explanation. After all he should have consulted Dembski who is on the records as--DembskiAs for your example, IÕm not going to take the bait. YouÕre asking me to play a game: ÓProvide as much detail in terms of possible causal mechanisms for your ID position as I do for my Darwinian position.Ó ID is not a mechanistic theory, and itÕs not IDÕs task to match your pathetic level of detail in telling mechanistic stories. If ID is correct and an intelligence is responsible and indispensable for certain structures, then it makes no sense to try to ape your method of connecting the dots. True, there may be dots to be connected. But there may also be fundamental discontinuities, and with IC systems that is what ID is discovering.--Are there still any ID proponents out there willing to defend the position? "	AGAINST

4578	creation	Behe claims that --They can bring together separate components and place them in relationship to each other, to create an effect that may be extremely unlikely to occur by chance. So we detect design by inferring that some parts appear to have been arranged for a purpose.--Remember however that this addresses only chance and not regularity. In fact, it is regularity which helps us understand how design inferences work in real science where science deals in concepts such as means, motives and opportunities to narrow down the possibilities not by relying on chance but rather on an interplay of regularity and chance. How do we determine that a person was involved in a crime? Not by stating that 'chance and regularity' cannot explain the data thus designed. Few crimes if any have been solved in this manner, and that should come as no surprise since we would expect to see many innocent people locked up. Without however understanding motive, means and opportunities, one cannot easily make a design conclusion. Gary Hurd presented a good example of how the circumstance of our background knowledge can greatly affect our inference. The case involves an example in which a religious person was bitten by a snake. Initially this seemed to be just another accident, until the police found out that the snake was part of a snake charming ceremony in which the faithful handle snakes. While not as much an accident, it was also not a case of attempted homicide but it could be interpreted as an attempted suicide. After all, what person would willingly handle these poisonous snakes? But then the police found out that the woman was the wife of the preacher and that the preacher had just taken out a large life insurance for his wife. Now suddenly the police became suspicious. But was this evidence of murder or just a coincidence?ID's hypothesis would be useless in this case. Of course, ID proponents may argue that the design inference is not meant for all circumstances but I would argue that for rarefied design, it is unsuitable in any circumstance. Rarefied design is design which lacks the necessary information to constrain the explanatory power through relevant background data.In addition, while the concept of purpose is used by Behe, ID provides no way to determine purpose and in fact, due to its teleological nature, natural selection, which selects for function can be easily lead to apparent design. In fact, this returns us to the Paley problem namely that science replace our ignorance with scientific pathways to explain the evolution of life on earth. That subsequent data continued to strengthen these findings has made evolutionary theory such a powerful explanation. While ID has good reasons to want to return to the pre-Paleyian age, it presents no methods to differentiate between apparent and actual design. In fact, such a differentiation is never truly possible in case of the supernatural because one could always argue that the designer used nature for its design, just like the evidence suggests.In fact, ID does not infer purpose or a purposeful arrangement, it merely claims that design is that which remains when science has failed (so far) to explain a particular feature or system. However, to call our ignorance 'design' is just equivocating on concepts.So next time an ID proponent asserts that ID detects design through the purposeful arrangement of parts, let's remember that this is NOT how ID's methods work.

It rightfully retains its historical significance as a turning point in Western society, but modern scientists rarely cite the text directly. Darwin's theory has almost entirely been supplanted by modern refinements. Remember that Darwin published his theory before the discovery of DNA. The mechanism he tentatively proposed to explain the heredity of traits, a critical component in his theory, was flawed and incorrect. Scientists discarded such ideas and incorporated discoveries from biology to create the modern evolutionary synthesis.    Darwin's theory was itself a refinement of earlier ideas. It had been known long into antiquity that species inherit traits and change over time. (Domestication of animals, animal breeding, etc) Darwin was the first to propose common descent. His novel idea was that isolated populations of the same species can diverge into separate species after many generations.In stark contrast, ""creation scientists"" will stubbornly resist any discovery that contradicts the earliest formulation of their ""theory."" I use quotes because creationism offers no specific mechanisms and makes no useful predictions. The text upon which the idea is based makes absolutely no claim to scientific accuracy.

HeÕs not. Rumors circulated that Sternberg, contrary to standard policy for scientific publications, did not send the paper out for peer review. He definitely did. It was also claimed that Sternberg did not conform to the journalÕs typical standards for seeking input from an associate editor. This is contested. Finally, it has been documented that communication between those associated with the journal and the Smithsonian Institution (involved in the journalÕs publication) and/or the National Center for Science Education (a leading anti-creationist organization) inquired about SternbergÕs religious beliefs, political affiliations, and even discussed whether he should be terminated, formally disciplined, or made to resign.21 And it was decided none of these things should occur.So what actually did happen? Sternberg stepped down from his post as editor, but everybody agrees this has nothing to do with the article, and his term was set to expire before it appeared anyway. He was not fired or asked to resign at the Smithsonian. In fact, he didnÕt even have a job at the Smithsonian to begin with (he is an employee of the National Institutes of Health). His was a courtesy appointment as a researcher, which was not rescinded. But after the term ran out, it was commuted to a lower prestige designation. From here the claims seem to get considerably more modest and also a bit more difficult to adjudicate. Sternberg claims his name was taken off his door, he had to move to worse work space, had to trade in his master key for another key, had to endure bureaucratic demands that others did not, and had his access to collections restricted. TheSmithsonian claims some of this happened and some didnÕt, but much of what did happen also happened to others for reasons of general policy, some even before the article came out. The worst case scenario Ð which does not seem altogether unlikely Ð is that Sternberg indeed experienced a hostile work environment. It seems clear that colleagues viewed him as having betrayed the standards and reputation (but not the policies) of the organization, they were ticked with him, and as is not uncommon in such situations, he was subjected to gossip and the diminution of discretionary professional courtesies. ---Source: Jeffrey P.

I don't know about that (Luskin's article) but is it not normal in scientific discourse to point out the weakness of a theory and then argue against it on the failure to explain away the weakness?---this is what I call bait and switch or moving the goalposts. When pointing out that ID is vacuous, you state, but well, it keeps science honest. If that were the full extent of ID, then there seems to be no need to get ID pushed into are school curricula, nor would it really add anything to science as this is, as you point out what science already does. Things get worse however, when said 'arguments' against evolutionary theory are based on fallacious, misleading or outright false claims. So even in this aspect I have found ID to be lacking scientific relevance. The real issue of course is that ID proposes nothing beyond 'well science cannot explain 'x' yet'. So what... Why the attempt to call this 'design' and then use bait and switch to conflate the narrow definition of 'design' with how people commonly understand 'design'. That's too Rovian for me... If the full extent of ID is that it remains 'critical of science' then you would have to agree with me that this renders ID scientifically without content, as it fails to contribute any knowledge to science, other than point out that science does not yet explain 'x'. Look at the bacterial flagella for instance, what has science done to increase our understanding of the flagella versus what has ID done?

You have, by making his claim, accepted the responsibility to find every possibly secular purpose of ID and demostrate with little doubt why it is a sham.

In cooperation with the pro-evolution National Center for Science Education (NCSE), Museum officials attempted to publicly smear and discredit Dr. Sternberg with false and defamatory information.Not only is this claim not supported by the emails in the appendix, it is flatly contradicted by them. The emails that Genie Scott exchanged were full of admonitions to Smithsonian personnel not to do the things they are now accused of conspiring to do. She urged them not to attack his religious views so as not to make him a martyr. Genie repeatedly tells them to focus solely on the questions of impropriety and see whether they can be proven. She also tells them that Sternberg should not be judged on the basis of his religious views or his creationist views, but solely on the basis of his work as a scientist. She says (p. 32):  --  On the other hand, his creationist views should not be the main focus of the criticism. First, if he can do good standard science, that's all we care about. Newton did pretty good science, and had some pretty nutty additional ideas about reality, too. So if he keeps the nut stuff out of his basically descriptive work, that's fine. His science should stand or fall on its own.And in a follow up email she wrote:--    I guess the big question is whether he is a good enough scientist to remain there. If his non-creationist work is good, then I think he deserves the job. If not, and if others are let go under the same circumstances, then let the chips fall where they may. But none of us are after this guy's job. That isn't the point of this exercise, in my opinion.In addition, she urged them to focus not on his views but on the real questions of impropriety surrounding the publishing of the Meyer article and his poor judgment:--    If there are repercussions for von Sternberg from the article, they should be because of his poor judgement in publishing it (your comments about editorial ""fairness"" are well taken). Therefore, this incident should be handled carefully, I believe.Clearly, she is urging great caution and arguing that they should not consider his views at all, but only his professional behavior, in handling the situation. The section of the report dealing with the NCSE, beginning on page 22, in fact contains not a shred of evidence, indeed not even an accusation, in support of the claim that the NCSE had, along with Smithsonian officials, ""attempted to publicly smear and discredit Dr. Sternberg with false and defamatory information.""--Source: Ed Brayton, ""Creating a Martyr: The Sternberg Saga Continues"", Talk Reason website        "	AGAINST

Once we agree on this simple fact, we can see if the Judge's ruling had a solid foundation.First of all, the judge observed that the school board was strongly motivated by religious beliefs and the fact that they believed that ID presented a scientific hypothesis and thus a valid secular purpose, was their downfall when the Judge showed not only how ID is tightly linked to religious motivations (the Wedge) but also that as a science it lacked any content.It is sufficient to point out that ID, which claims that design is that which remains when we cannot explain something using natural processes of regularity or chance, must be either the empty set or the supernatural.

The creationist account requires a belief founded on faith and is not a 'working hypothesis' testable using observation or experiment.

A hypothesis is an assumption that is not taken as ""truth"", but as speculation. Evidence is used to test a hypothesis with the goal of demonstrating that it is likely true or unlikely true. If the evidence demonstrates that a hypothesis is likely false, then it is scrapped, and a new hypothesis is formed. This is the strict process of the scientific method. Critics of creation argue that creationism takes the Genesis account (actually there are two Genesis accounts, in Gen 1.1-2.3 and Gen 2.4-3.24) as necessarily true in every particular, and then bends the historical evidence to fit that so-called ÔhypothesisÕ. Because creationism attempts to advance an unalterable hypothesis or doctrine, it does not follow the basic principles of science, which stem from doubt, hypothesizing, and re-hypothesizing on to accepted theory.

Of course, this is wrong in the sense that it may ignore the fact that randomness can in fact be an attribute of a designer and of course, the simplistic statement that randomness and design are mutually exclusive only captures part of the ID argument.By focusing on pure chance, Highlander has shown that he does not understand the ID argument and has highlighted one of the major problems for ID, namely that regularity and chance can explain information and complexity quite well.Until we clarify the terminology, highlander's arguments seem irrelevant at best as they argue a strawman version of reality.When asked for examples, Highlander remains without any, exemplifying once again the scientific vacuity of Intelligent Design.

4655	creation	--Jim--Finally, I just want to say that it appears to me that statements made against ID and their proponents -- made by others, not you -- regarding ID has been so emotionally charged it makes me feel their judgment is affected. It seems that itÕs a very powerful argument to say if something appears designed, it may be because it is designed. Some make the statement it may appear designed but it is not. If that is so, whereÕs the proof?--Just look at Darwin who showed how what previously had been seen as requiring design now suddenly did not necessitate design. In other words, while design in the larger sense can never be disproven since we can always propose a designer who used natural law, it can be shown that design is not a requirement or a necessary component.So we see the evidence strongly point to the fact of evolution (change over time, common ancestry) and thus there is strong evidence that suggests that design in these cases is apparent as it can be explained by processes of regularity and chance. However, we can also agree, that a God could very well have designed through these processes of regularity and chance, making design not a necessity but still a logical plausibility. Of course, there are variants which involve a God who created species at every single step and decided to make it appear to have evolved through natural processes of regularity and chance. That of course, requires one to propose motives and means for which we have no evidence.Sure, the arguments surrounding ID are emotionally loaded, mostly because of the strong religious overtones however my major concerns are not with the theological flaws of ID but rather how it is doomed to remain scientifically vacuous.

By its definition it means âa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomenaâ. On another topic of discussion, I would like to point out, for those who say that evolution cannot be proven, that nothing in the real world can be proven with absolute certainty (since no one will ever know everything there is to know about anything). However, high degrees of certainty can be reached. In the case of evolution, we have huge amounts of data from diverse fields.

The theory of evolution has also proved itself in practice. It has useful applications in epidemiology, pest control, drug discovery, and other areas. Furthermore, if the claim of âitâs only a theoryâ were a real objection, creationists would also be issuing disclaimers complaining about the theory of gravity, atomic theory, the germ theory of disease, and the theory of limits (on which calculus is based). The theory of evolution is no less valid than any of the theories given above. So why arenât the ones complaining about the Evolutionary Theory also complaining in separate debating topics about why we shouldn't accept the existence of gravity, since itâs only a theory? Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact.	AGAINST

4665	creation	Or that evolution is a process involving randomness and natural selection. Has that been tested?--For the purposes of this post, I am going to assume that you are not challenging randomness in the statistical sense.In the most strict sense, evolution is the change of allele frequencies in a population over time.  Natural selection is the scientific principle that favorable inherited traits (alleles) become more common in populations over time.  I have only been skimming these posts, so I am not certain how much of Darwinian biology you agree with, such as basic population genetics principles or biochemistry.  Assuming you do agree with most of it and are solely arguing about the ontological facets of it, then above question is quickly answered.  If you have a neutral trait (i.e. one with no demonstrable effect upon evolutionary fitness) then the frequency of alleles in a population will fluctuate in a random manner.  Now, using this as a baseline, testing natural selection is quite simple.  Say the aforementioned alleles exists a population of yeast cells.  These alleles all currently code for proteins that do nothing.  These proteins catalyze no reactions, they provide no structural support, they merely exist and the cells transcriptional and translation machinery pumps out a useless protein.  Now, a point mutation arises in one of the alleles and the protein encoded by that allele can now digest a certain disaccharide which we will call A.  Prior to this there was no other allele at any location on any other chromosome in any of the yeast cells in the population that coded for an enzyme which could catalyze A.  At this point you could test natural selection (that favorable inherited traits become more common over time) by observing the change in allele frequencies after the yeast cells are plated upon a culture where A is the only type of molecule available for cellular energy.  Following plating, measure the change in allele frequencies.  If the frequencies change so that the A-digesting protein/allele is the only remaining allele, then natural selection as a concept clearly seems correct.  Keep repeating until you've made yourself happy that there is no other outcome.	AGAINST

4676	creation	Island referenced a 2004 article, however science does proceed and indeed--Abstract: We apply the recently defined multipole vector framework to the frequency-specific first-year WMAP sky maps, estimating the low-l multipole coefficients from the high-latitude sky by means of a power equalization filter. While most previous analyses of this type have considered only heavily processed (and foreground-contaminated) full-sky maps, the present approach allows for greater control of residual foregrounds, and therefore potentially also for cosmologically important conclusions. The low-l spherical harmonics coefficients and corresponding multipole vectors are tabulated for easy reference.Using this formalism, we re-assess a set of earlier claims of both cosmological and non-cosmological low-l correlations based on multipole vectors. First, we show that the apparent l=3 and 8 correlation claimed by Copi et al. (2004) is present only in the heavily processed map produced by Tegmark et al. (2003), and must therefore be considered an artifact of that map. Second, the well-known quadrupole-octopole correlation is confirmed at the 99% significance level, and shown to be robust with respect to frequency and sky cut. Previous claims are thus supported by our analysis. Finally, the low-l alignment with respect to the ecliptic claimed by Schwarz et al. (2004) is nominally confirmed in this analysis, but also shown to be very dependent on severe a-posteriori choices. Indeed, we show that given the peculiar quadrupole-octopole arrangement, finding such a strong alignment with the ecliptic is not unusual. --Authors: P. Bielewicz, H. K. Eriksen, A. J. Banday, K. M. Gorski, P. B. LiljeTitle: Multipole vector anomalies in the first-year WMAP data: a cut-sky analysisAstrophys.J. 635 (2005) 750-760Conclusions:--In this paper, we have revisited a set of claims found in the literature regarding the low-? CMB pattern and multipole vectors. We have remedied the most serious outstanding problem connected to these analyses, in that we have used only partial sky data to estimate the multipole vectors. This allowed us to study the frequency-speciÞc WMAP sky maps individually, while imposing different sky cuts to study regional dependence. Using these methods, the multipole vector approach may Þnally be used for cosmological analysis. Three claims were studied in depth. First, Copi et al. (2004) found a set of strong correlations among the ? = 2, . . . , 8 multipoles using the multipole vector formalism. Unfortunately, they only had access to two full-sky maps (the WILC and TOH sky maps), which are known to be contaminated by galactic foregrounds. While we reproduced their results for these two maps, we also found that the anomaly is not present in the best available frequency-speciÞc CMB maps. Therefore, as far as the low-? correlations are statistically signiÞcant, they must be considered an artifact of the TOH and WILC sky maps, and not of the WMAP data as a whole. Second, we revisited the much more established anomaly Þrst reported by de Oliveira-Costa et al. (2004); the strong alignment between the quadrupole and octopole moments. Our results conÞrm previous conclusions: The effect is signiÞcant at the 98-99% conÞdence level, and independent of frequency and sky cut. It appears to be quite robust. Finally, we also considered the claims made by Schwarz et al. (2004), that the low-? CMB Þeld could be of solar system origin. This claim was based on the observation that the ? = 2 and 3 multipole cross-product vectors align with the ecliptic north-south axis, and, indeed, that they point towards the vernal equinox. While the nominal signiÞcance of these results are conÞrmed in this paper, we also found that it is not at all unusual to observe such a strong alignment with one of the three major axes (ecliptic, galactic or super-galactic), given the peculiar internal arrangements of the quadrupole and octopole. Thus, it is not the ecliptic correlation per se that is anomalous, but rather the quadrupole-octopole alignment. Whether this latter feature is caused by cosmological or non-cosmological physics is not yet clear, but solar-system physics does not appear to provide the most plausible explanation. ---Cheers	AGAINST

4678	creation	I think you have some misconceptions about what evolution actually is. Nothing ever changes into something completely different...that's impossible. Every generation is the same species as the previous generation, but with some added mutations orginally these mutations occur to the point where the end species cannot mate with the original, and that is where biologists arbitrarily draw the line as to a different species. In this sense we have seen many many examples of evolution.In addition, we really do see new species of bacteria, and no it wouldn't take millions of years for them to evolve into a new species. It might take a long time for them to be mostly unrecognizeable from their parent species but dissimilarity to an ancester species is not a requirement to the observation of evolution.In addition you claim that you would only except that scientists have observed evolution if they saw something without wings evolve into something with wings. Now obviously this is virtually impossible because the chances of parralel evolution of an exact same feature are virtually none, however I'm pretty sure you were being fecicious. Would you instead settle for the evolution of a mechanism in an organism that could didn't exist previously?I present for your consideration nylon-eating bacteria. Nylon obviously wasn't invented until 1935 and therefore this mechanism could not possibly have existed before this time.So there, it's not feathers but it is evolution.	AGAINST

Numerous documents in evidence reveal FTE to be a religious organization with religious objectives, not a scientific one pursuing scientific aims. P12; P28; P168A; P566; P633; 10:90-92, 96-101 (Forrest). The FTE ignores all this evidence in its amicus brief.In a pre-trial hearing in this case, FTE president Jon Buell attributed religious descriptions of his organization, in legally required public filings he had signed, to mistakes by lawyers and accountants. The Court can decide whether Mr. Buell and the FTE were filing false documents with the federal government and the State of Texas, or whether they were instead misrepresenting themselves to this Court, by disowning the religious agenda stated in those documents. The overwhelming evidence from Mr. BuellÕs own writings regarding his and FTEÕs Christian, creationist objectives gives the Court ample basis to make that judgment. P12; P28; P168A; P566; P633; 10:90-92,96-101 (Forrest). Either way, the FTEÕs submission is entitled to no credence or respect from this Court.This is particularly true of the FTEÕs rationalization for the substitution of the phrase Òintelligent designÓ for ÒcreationÓ in versions of Pandas prepared after Edwards. FTE makes the impossibly silly argument that by discarding the words ÒcreationÓ and ÒcreationismÓ found in early drafts, the FTE expressly rejected creationism. FTE Brief at 17. The only way the drafting history of Pandas could be interpreted as rejecting creationism is if the authors had discarded not just the word, but the explanation of what the word means Ñ Òvarious forms of life began abruptly through an intelligent agency with their distinctive features already intact Ñ fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc.Ó The retention of the central creationist concepts using a different term, Òintelligent design,Ó dictates only one inference: intelligent design equals creationism.If this were not true, surely the FTE would have provided an explanation in its brief for why Pandas was written by two admittedly creationist authors, one of whom was an advocate for creation science in the federal courts, and for why Buell thought that the Edwards ruling on creation science would matter so much to the financial success of Pandas. P350; 10: 102-104, 126-128 (Forrest). But there is no discussion of these facts.--Or Minnich --Q. Sir, is it your understanding that creationism requires an abrupt appearance of life on earth?A. Creationism, you know, scientific creationism, yeah, ex nihilo appearance of life forms.Q. Is this ex nihilo appearance of life forms, is that a theological concept?A. Yes, yes. Out of nothing.Q. Does this statement in Pandas that I just reviewed with you, does this make intelligent design creationism?A. No, I don't think so. I mean, this is a literal interpretation of the fossil record where you see the sudden appearance of these forms, you know, fish with fins, etc. in a geologic record. From my interpretation this isn't ex nihilo, you know, creation from nothing.--ROTFLRuling--Demonstrative charts introduced through Dr. Forrest show parallel arguments relating to the rejection of naturalism, evolutionÕs threat to culture and society, Òabrupt appearanceÓ implying divine creation, the exploitation of the same alleged gaps in the fossil record, the alleged inability of science to explain complex biological information like DNA, as well as the theme that proponents of each version of creationism merely aim to teach a scientific alternative to evolution to show its Òstrengths and weaknesses,Ó and to alert students to a supposed ÒcontroversyÓ in the scientific community.

(P-853; P-845; 37:155-56 (Minnich)).--And then of all people Fuller, expert witness for the defense!!!--Moreover and as previously stated, there is hardly better evidence of IDÕs relationship with creationism than an explicit statement by defense expert Fuller that ID is a form of creationism.

4699	creation	--Having been asked to contribute a discussion of the anthropic principle for a colloquium on cosmology, I would start by recalling that although its original formulation [1] was motivated by a problem of cosmology (DiracÕs) and although many of its most interesting subsequent applications (such as the recent evaluation [2] of the dark energy density in the universe) have also been concerned with large scale global effects, the principle for which I introduced the term ÒanthropicÓ is not intrinsically cosmological, but just as relevant on small local scales as at a global level. --its original formulation was motivated by a problem of cosmology...--CarterThis presentation will not attempt to deal with the confusion that has arisen from such dissident interpretations, but will be concerned only with developments of my originally intended meaning, which I shall attempt to explain in the next section. --then--Although frequently relevant to purely local applications, the anthropic principle was originally formulated in a cosmological context as a reasonable compromise two successively fashionable extremes. The Þrst of these was what might be described as the autocentric principle, which underlay the pre Copernican dogma to the effect that as terrestrial observers we occupy a privileged position at the center of the universe. The opposite extreme was the more recent precept describable as the cosmological ubiquity principle, but commonly referred to just as the cosmological principle, which would haveit that the Universe is much the same everywhere, having no priviledged center, and that our own neighbourhood can be considered as a typical random sample. --	AGAINST

It is also designed to prevent people from being forced to practice a religion.  These are worthy reasons for the second amendment.  However, not a single person will be prevented from practicing or will be forced to practice a religion if ID is taught in schools.  Therefore, the reasons for the second amendment are not applicable to the teaching of ID.  There is no scientific evidence that atheist students suffer mental health complications as a result of being exposed to Intelligent Design, nor evidence that their or their parent's ability to vote how they wish will be affected.  There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that harm is caused to anyone after repeated exposure to Intelligent Design.  The hypothesis that people's rights will be violated and/or harm will be caused is not supported in any peer-reviewed journals (and we all know that if it ain't in peer-reviewed journals, then it should not be believed).

For example, see The Ayn Rand InstituteÕs posts argue that if ID implies a supernatural creator (at the bottom of a chain of designers), then ID is unscientific.--I am very aware of my 'concession' namely that it is not just the religious motivations of ID which disqualifies ID as having merit as a science, it's the lack of scientific contributions (the examples you mention have little or no relevance to the concept of ID but are at best examples of ""ID proponents can also do real science"") which dooms ID to a lack of merit as a scientific contribution.That ID points to the supernatural is one of the major reasons why it lacks content as such a 'creator' (oops designer) cannot be constrained and thus explains nothing.I am not sure if the NCSE argues that ID is unscientific just because it is religiously motivated. I think that their argument may be better phrased as ""ID's religious motivation helps explain why it has remained scientifically vacuous"".

Other mutations that are helpful in the fight with malaria also degrade or destroy genes, such as globin genes and the genes for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, Duffy antigen, and Band 3 protein.""I wanted to clarify two points in this paragraph, first 'a number' is a little vague Ð thereÕs a lot. For example, over 160 G6PD deficiency variants have been categorised worldwide, these are just the common ones people have bothered publishing on. Dozens of other genes have been highlighted in candidate gene and linkage studies.Second, Sickle is famous because of the nasty disease/geographical distribution but there are at other goblin variants that cause fewer symptoms. It is maintained in the population because it is so effective at preventing malaria. Much of the variation linked to malaria susceptibility has more modest effects. Third, some variants modulate function without causing any health problems, for example Duffy negative variant - which prevents expression only on red blood cells, but not other cell types, and causes no health problems. ThatÕs more than throwing a spanner into the machine, its targeting a promoter sequence with a rather subtle change.Fourth, some variants altering malaria susceptibility - generate or boost function - variation at the MHC locus, ABO glycosyltransferase or hereditary hypersplenism.

Why would anyone who is really interested in the truth want to do this? This point is as clear as day to most people and I believe this is why so many people favor open debate on the issue.  Only Darwinists want to censor the debate.If there can be evidence against design, then, certainly, like you said, there can be evidence for design.We need to be open to follow the evidence where ever it leads and not predetermine where it can and cannot lead us.

Many have taken that step when they started to believe in Darwinism and understood the implications of that view on the Bible and religion. God is no longer ""necessary"" in their eyes.---I agree, there are Christians who believe that the earth must be young, something contradicted by fact. There are Christians who believe other foolishness, but they are still Christians. The more coherent Christians have found to reconcile their faith with what God is showing them. That this means that God does become unnecessary, is what makes Christian faith so powerful. We can all believe in something we consider necessary, but what faith it is when we accept something that is not necessary and yet adds so much to our worldview?Insisting that God reveals Himself in His Creation to scientific scrutiny seems to me as lacking faith.

Worse, in the case of ID is its strong foundation in Christian faith which combined with its failure to be scientifically relevant, has doomed it to remain constitutionally suspect.This is not about honest debates, or brainwashing. But I understand that these form much of the foundation for ID proponent's fear of that which they do not understand. And the confusion created by ID proponents like Johnson, who argued somewhat 'foolishly' that science uses philosophical naturalism, have spread a level of fear that seems to have clouded ID proponents into actually believing not only that science is atheistic, but worse, that ID provides a solution. Perhaps as a theology yes, although it raises some significant questions here too.

4720	creation	Yes, God is by his nature - supernatural.  That's not an excuse.. It's a core concept.  So just by that nature some things are likely to not be measurable.. or have materialistic explanations.   Including 'where God got the   energy  ' to create the universe.  Although, possibly through   science   there may be a way to measure such a thing.. possibly it relates to dark matter.. and dark energy? But at this point I truly couldn't say.. and considering I'm not 'in the field' - I'd really have to depend on what is presented to us like most people.. and judge from the data.Many things would leave signs... often creationist's view the big bang with mixed feelings.. because in one hand it seems to confirm creation.. but also conflicts.   Even though I believe the big bang theory is flawed.. it does give an example of what I mean by signs.. - Then it comes down to comparing the biblical narrative with our scientific understanding..  To test what agrees..This is why the age of the earth and Genesis have received so much focus - although an old earth doesn't truly rule out the   bible  's authority - it does leave creationists with a genesis which is symbolic.. not literal.. You could still believe in God.. but the weight of the argument would be dramatically lessened.  Though geology feels it's an open and shut case... there are plenty of questions - if the Grand Canyon is the result of millions of years of erosion... where would the land from that erosion end up?  It doesn't appear to be there. - also why is the river that is claimed to have created it so drastically small in comparison... a catastrophic flood doesn't suffer from these types of problems.As far as the miracles of the Bible... including those of the life of Christ - these were necessary at the time for the purposes of that same 'plausible deniability' I spoke of.. it served to build God's case for believers.  I never said that God doesn't do miracles.. for that matter the reason I'm so positive of God's existence is through things which happened in my own life.  Since they are personal experiences they don't have weight with other people.. only for me.  It left nothing physical - no faces of Jesus in pancake batter.. or anything I can point to as an example.. But definitely in some cases in the past as well as currently God reveals himself in a way to some people which leaves no chance of denying..(but oddly enough.. there were those who witnessed these things that still didn't believe)  But generally speaking, parting the red sea.. and things of this nature occurred during biblical times and not now...  These things were deliberately done by God during a time period that proving them would be very difficult... yet there should be signs of them happening if we look.  To summarize.. it was necessary at one point in history for God to make himself more clearly known.. for him to take a more visibly active part in the world.What was known at that time in history is debatable.. like the earth being 'round'.  There were pockets of scholars at the time that had views on these things.. - but it's not as if they had a printing press.  Although really the point of mentioning a round world.. or a mentioning of the world hanging on nothing. (which seems to imply gravity to me... though the line is 'poetic' it is an accurate description.. it truly hangs on nothing)  but anyway.. the point of these lines is more that they do not disagree with science.. creation myths from different civilizations throughout time cannot make that claim - they often do disagree with known science .. matter of fact more often than they agree with it.

A few years ago, he outlined based on an extensive study of the scientific literature and homology studies a plausible scenario for the evolution of the bacterial flagellum.The title was ""Evolution in (Brownian) space: a model for the origin of the bacterial flagellum""       In this article, Nick outlined various predictions and now we have received the exciting news that science has found supporting evidence for his predictionsAnother touch down for science.Mark Pallen, one of several experts, has written two articles in which he outlines not only how ID has remained scientifically without content in describing the bacterial flagellum, the hallmark evidence of design according to ID, but also how science has developed a level of knowledge which has removed yet another cloud of ignorance, and thus further dismantling the 'design inference'.      When will ID proponents admit that Behe was wrong and that 'design' has been disproven? Dispatches from the cutting edge of flagellar biology, part 1      Dispatches from the cutting edge of flagellar biology, part 2      --In 2003, Nick Matzke (then at the NCSE and so a couple of years later science adviser to the plaintiffs in the Dover trial) wrote an essay summarising plausible evolutionary scenarios for the origin of the bacterial flagellum. He noted a couple of previous suggestions that the proto-flagellum might have originated from the F-type ATPase. Crucially, he predicted that additional homologies would be found between components of the F-type ATPase and the flagellar protein export apparatus, for example between the b subunit of the ATPase and FliH and between the delta subunit and FliJ. In 2006, I confirmed one of Nick's hunches through homology searches, showing that part of FliH was homologous to the b subunit. However, things turned out slightly different from Nick's predictions in that FliH is actual of a fusion of domains homologous to the b subunit and the delta subunit.Last year Namba's group published the structure of FliI and confirmed the striking homology with the F-type ATPase enzymatic subunits. At that stage in the game, it had become clear that the ATPase was a universal component not just of flagellar export systems but also of non-flagellar type III secretion systems. Also, if it was also clear that if one knocked out the gene for FliI, one abolished flagellar biosynthesis. Thus, just about everyone in the field accepted that FliI was an essential component of the flagellar apparatus and that it energised secretion of proteins through the protein export system. In other words, if there were anything to the idea, put forward by Behe and others in the ID movement, that the flagellum showed ""irreducible complexity"", even experts might have accepted that FliI was one of the ""irreducible"" components!!BUT earlier this year, Minamino and Namba (and independently a team headed by Kelly Hughes in the US) overturned all our assumptions by showing that it was perfectly possible to make flagella without FliI--what you needed to do was knock out FliH at the same time. Somehow or other FliH, which usually interacts with FliI, gums up the export apparatus in the absence of FliI. So, bang goes another pillar of support for the ID argument! In fact, it appears that flagellar protein export is powered not primarily by the ATPase by the proton-motive force. ..He provided a run through of all the work leading up to his recent Nature article on the dispensibility of FliI. I was then very proud to see him cite my paper on the FliH/F-type ATPase homology. But then he provided the final piece in the jigsaw (and Nick Matzke's ears should prick up at this point)!Namba and colleagues have now solved the structure of FliJ, another protein that interacts with FliI and FliH. And what they found was clear evidence of homology with yet another protein from the F-type ATPase--the gamma subunit!--So in other words, science supported two predictions by Nick Matzke and showed how Flil was not an essential part of flagellar function, even though knocking it out would prevent the flagellum from forming, when in addition to Flil also FliH was knocked out, the flagellum formed.What a day in history"	AGAINST

4790	creation	"OK, you are right on this point as well.  There is a difference between methodological naturalism and naturalism.  I am still learning here.  However, whether a scientist is a methodological naturalist or a true naturalist really doesn't matter.  When they do their work, they do it assuming naturalism to be true.  In other words, they allow no possibility for supernatural explanations or causes.  This is even more difficult to understand if the person is not a true naturalist. Who says that scientists need to approach science from the perspective of naturalism?  Who made that rule?  Is it valid?  No. Of course not.  Because they are dismissing the possibility of a Designer, or any and all supernatural causes for the effects they study from the beginning.  There is no rational reason why this should be.  I mean think about it.  Why would someone who is not a naturalist assume that worldview only when he does science?  Unless it is possible to prove that God does not exist (which it isnÕt), to simply assume that He does not even if it is only in methodology, would be irrational.How the world came to be and the natural forces at work in the universe right now are not necessarily connected.  For instance the forces that make a car and the principles that enable it to work are different. Just because the forces that enable the car to work are natural does not automatically mean that the forces that created it to begin with are natural as well.  This is an arbitrary and illogical conclusion.  To block out all other answers is not rational.I agree with you though that Darwinism does not automatically lead a person to atheism. There are a lot of inconsistent Christians around.  There are a lot of inconsistent evolutionists around as well.  However, if naturalism is true, then it does lead to that conclusion.  Since Darwinism is based on naturalism, even if only methodological naturalism, it is a very simple step to atheism from there.  Many have taken that step when they started to believe in Darwinism and understood the implications of that view on the Bible and religion.  God is no longer ""necessary"" in their eyes. As Oxford evolutionist and antitheist Richard Dawkins claimed, it was impossible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist before Darwin. The implication is that now it has become possible.  Stein should have said that Darwin made it much easier to become an atheist rather than Darwin leads to atheism.  It does not in every case.  He simply overstated the problem.tjtjIn the recent movie, ""Expelled"" the claim is made by Stein that it ""Òappears Darwinism does lead to atheism.ÓAs Schloss explains in his 33 page review, this is an important claim and it is wrong--This is a hugely important claim, which is undoubtedly the core issue in the cultural debate over ID. It is the reason the ID movement musters such passionate commitment and why it is, in fact, a ÒmovementÓ at all. In the movie, ID proponent Jeffrey Schwartz concludes, ÒThe conflict over the principles of evolution has become a religious war; it is no longer a conflict over science.Ó Whether or not the debate was ever primarily over science, the film is correct in identifying it as being a world-view conflict that is largely religious in character. The question we desperately need to address is whether this is a conflict that must be fought, and what is the evidence presented in the movie for going to battle? Does Darwinism Òlead to atheismÓ?--Concluding--And even if Expelled wanted to take a very strong stand on an extreme answer to the questions, that would have been stimulating. But the stand seems to have been taken, without letting in the questions. At least on this question Ð Òdoes evolution lead to atheism?Ó - the movie seems to have forgotten the Proverb. I donÕt happen to think all ID theorists are intellectual terrorists. But ironically, in failing to distinguish genuine enemies of religion from passionate advocates of evolutionary theory Ð by pitting itself against the evil empire of Darwinism Ð this part of the film seems to confirm the very stereotype it seeks to debunk.--PS the proverb referenced is ""When the banner unfurls, all reason is in the trumpet.Ó - Ukrainian Proverb"	FAVOR

You're are right about one thing though. There are thousands of fossils showing what look like steps but there is no gradual change. Your examples of a defined developmental line are actually examples of a fragmented developmental line. And there are a ton more you could list. What you are talking about is macro evolution.

""In addition you have fallen victim of the claim that just because the FTE was denied to be heard, that the argument was not heard.""Nothing in the passage of the ruling mentions that their argument was heard.""(1) the definition for creation science in early drafts is identical to the definition of ID;""If that's true, then the context of the term ""creation science"" was not used in a religious manner at all.

From one of the authors of the book:""I wasnÕt comfortable with the typical vocabulary that for the most part creationists were using because it didnÕt express what I was trying to do. They were wanting to bring God into the discussion, and I was wanting to stay within the empirical domain and do what you can do legitimately there.""(Deposition of Charles Thaxton 52-53, Kitzmiller, No. 4:04-CV-2688 (M.D. Pa., July 19, 2005))That was how he coined the term ""Intelligent Design.""  ""***This word substitution is telling, significant, and reveals that a purposeful change of words was effected without any corresponding change in content, which directly refutes FTE's argument that by merely disregarding the words ""creation"" and ""creationism,"" FTE expressly rejected creationism in Pandas.***""Considering the source of Judge Jones' ruling, it's no surprise that he would come to this conclusion without giving the FTE a fair trial. The answer is no, it doesn't. None of the three points Judges Jones and the ACLU make show that the early drafts specifically implicate god or the supernatural in Pandas. All it does show is that they wanted people to be aware they were writing about a completely different set of ideas then what creationists where aiming for in the late 80's. ""In early pre-Edwards drafts of Pandas, the term ""creation"" was defined as ""various forms of life that began abruptly through an intelligent agency with their distinctive features intact Ð fish with fins and scales, birds with feathers, beaks, and wings, etc,"" the very same way in which ID is defined in the subsequent published versions.

I wonder if the Judge would have been able to make such an effective ruling without the contributions and testimonies of Michael Behe.For instance--Stated another way, ID posits that animals did not evolve naturally through evolutionary means but were created abruptly by a non-natural, or supernatural, designer. Defendants' own expert witnesses acknowledged this point. (21:96-100 (Behe); P-718 at 696, 700 (""implausible that the designer is a natural entity""); 28:21-22 (Fuller) ("". . . ID's rejection of naturalism and commitment to supernaturalism . . .""); 38:95-96 (Minnich) (ID does not exclude the possibility of a supernatural designer, including deities).It is notable that defense experts' own mission, which mirrors that of the IDM itself, is to change the ground rules of science to allow supernatural causation of the natural world, which the Supreme Court in Edwards and the court in McLean correctly recognized as an inherently religious concept. Edwards, 482 U.S. at 591-92; McLean, 529 F. Supp. at 1267. First, defense expert Professor Fuller agreed that ID aspires to ""change the ground rules"" of science and lead defense expert Professor Behe admitted that his broadened definition of science, which encompasses ID, would also embrace astrology.

Moreover, defense expert Professor Minnich acknowledged that for ID to be considered science, the ground rules of science have to be broadened to allow consideration of supernatural forces.

All mutations can be regarded as 'degradative' in some sense, but they are constructive in a different sense, because mutations involve a fitness trade-off. We know a prori that E. coli is very well adapted to its natural habitat. After 3.5 billion years of evolution, it is unfathomably unlikely that in .00000001 % of that time we will see natural selection produce and adaptation that is a pareto improvement on the function of E. coli, that is: an improvement with no cost. The only reason we see any beneficial mutations whatsoever is because we are placing E. coli in an evolutionarily novel habitat, where some of E. coli's genes are unnecessary, and where it lacks some functions which would be beneficial.   By way of analogy, if I took a coat hanger from my closet, bent it, and turned it into a well formed T.V. antenna, I would have greatly decreased the hangers ability to hold a coat. But if I don't need a coat hanger, and I do need an antenna, it is difficult to see how we can describe transforming a coat hanger into an antenna as ""degradative"", since the antenna has a highly specified from that looks just as designed as the coat hanger.  If I choose to regard all improvements which are not pareto improvement as 'degradative', then I would not expect to ever find evidence for evolution. Evolution works by making trade offs, destroying one thing to make a more immediately useful thing. So, because Mr. Behe confuses the kinds of improvements that natural selection makes with universal improvements in function. Because of this he sees no evidence for natural selection's ability to improve organismal function. The key test of Mr. Behe's characterization of the E. coli's cit+ mutations as 'degradative' will come when the mutations are fully characterized and we discover whether or not the novel proteins, which have unarguably be created by natural selection, function efficiently for cit+ metabolism. Putatively, I believe, a gene duplication has occurred, such that the cit+ E. coli have not lost any ancestral function.When these mutations are characterized and we have again documented natural selection creating novel cellular machinery, it may aid in preserving Mr. Behe credibility if he acknowledges that natural selection can create efficient cellular machinery.

4864	creation	To say that evolution has been scientifically proved would require that it be first studied then determined scientifically. To do so would require that the question be analyzed for its scientific qualities; those true and those false. Any falsehood would constitute a rejection of the theory as a whole, and the proponents would have to start again from a different hypothesis. This does not in any way speak to any objective measure of the absolute truth or falsehood of the theory itself, but rather the wording and logic behind the theory, as any theory can only be judged on the basis of its wording to be judged objectively, and not subjectively which would only be a matter of opinion. Therefore the rejection of the scientific method is complete in the sense that it cannot be disproven on the basis of absolute knowledge outside the tools of argument available; namely words, which are the basis for any theory or hypothesis being argued, defended, or subjected to tests to find weaknesses in order to reject that theory. Such a theory cannot be truly known or even truly unknown, for to be truly unknown one must first truly know what is not to be known, and surely that itself cannot be known, truly. Really in reality it is difficult to prove with absolute certainty or absolute uncertainty the absolute absurdity or surdity of what is known or what is to be unknown, even at a future date in time. Space. Space, the final frontier, you are already here, but knowing exactly where you are with respect to where you were is certainly uncertain for even a population of sodium atoms at or near absolute zero can not be known in terms of absolute position or velocity, for as the velocity approaches absolute zero, we become more and more certain of that velocity, but must necessarily also become more and more uncertain of its position, each atoms wave function spreading out until it overlaps with its neighbors until it is totally indistinguishable from its neighbors forming a singular blob of matter. But this is only verified by experiment, which is the only and best test to be used by the scientific method, which can only truly be used to reject a hypothesis. That said, a hypothesis may be accepted, but not scientifically, but for all intents and purposes may be treated as absolute truth, baring any contrary evidence; as occums razor would point out the simplest hypothesis which explains the phenomenon is the most likely, again baring any contrary evidence. But when that evidence cannot be explored by conventional methods of observation ie: through the senses directly or indirectly relating to the physical and tangible world, then such a theory cannot be honestly and objectively analyzed or compared to the princeps of our understanding of the world and its phenomenon; it is detached from them. Surely such a word is a word apart from other words in the world of words such a word is subject to suspicion and castigation for being as it is a word not of the other words but another word of that which cannot be known by what other words are known knowingly it is known that what cannot be known cannot be be said while being said to be known for that which is known to be known was already said, or implied, the implication being that the knowledge of the tree of knowledge of good and evil as it was written by the word in words and communicated thusly; by words, cannot be known by the same token, for the token has two sides, each side opposite the other, and each side opposing the direction of the other, without either side facing the other, but rather facing away, as it is when two sides face away from one another but do not look at each other directly. So it is that the argument, whether by proof of evidence or scientific method or any other method, that the theory cannot directly oppose its opposite argument, but can only be described from an outside observer who does not stand and look outwards only from one side or argument. One that holds the token cannot stand upon it. For one cannot at the same time support one side of an argument, and also observe objectively between arguments. Neither can the word be subdivided or separated without losing the intended meaning of the whole. But without deductive reasoning we are lost. But without inductive reasoning we cannot make general statements about the world. But without particulars the general cannot be described. But without apriori knowledge of the general, we cannot be sure of its particulars. And so the scientific method, while a tool used to disprove but said to prove cannot prove but only disprove and then only if the subject is implicitly accepted, and the method of test also being accepted in its general power to come to particular conclusions of what is known to be not true. That the evolution of the scientific method has developed is proof enough that such a theory cannot be disproven. Or has it?	FAVOR

4873	creation	"Wow...where to start?First, there is no such thing as an ""evolutionist"". Evolution is not a religion or belief system, but instead a well tested theory backed up by evidence in many scientific fields such as geology, embryology, genetics, and other fields of biology. A more accurate term to use would be scientist because over 99% of scientists agree with evolution. But hey, what do they know?I will talk about the evidence for evolution later but first allow me to answer some of your questions:Then why is the top of Mt Everest covered in fossilized clams?That's simple. The surface of the earth is covered by large masses of land known as tectonic plates. There are two types of tectonic plates, oceanic and continental. When two continental plates collide, mountains form. In this case, the Indian subcontinent collided with the Eurasian Plate forming the Himalayas. In fact this collision is still occurring and Mt. Everest is rising a few inches each year. What does this have to do with fossilized clams? At one point during earth's history, the rocks that currently make up the Himalayas were underwater and during this time the clams would have been fossilized. The mountains were raised later. In addition, if you are trying to say that these clams are evidence of the biblical flood (if you are not please correct me), then you should know that fossilization of the type witnessed on the top of Mt. Everest could not have happened in a short amount of time. They would have to have been covered for thousands of years. Didn't the flood supposedly only last 40 days?Why have sets of human footprints have been found on top and next to dinosaur footprints?Short answer: They haven'tLong Answer: Although creationists originally claimed that ""man-tracks"" appeared with dinosaur prints near in Glen Rose Texas, these assertions were later proven to be false. The supposed human footprints were in fact shown to be dinosaur footprints that had been eroded, natural features, and some doctored and carved specimens.Why are there so many ""fossil graveyards"" (the result of swirling water eddies)?Could you be more specific? I have never heard the term fossil graveyard, and I fail to see how this could possibly point to ""swirling water eddies.""Why did the earth have to be created instantaneously (www.halos.com)?This theory was thought up by Robert Gentry, who based his conclusion on what he called ""halos"" found in certain primordial rocks. Gentry is a physicist not a geologist however, so his method of observations, and the conclusions he comes to are flawed. You might as well ask a plumber to falsify string theory. The problems with his research are numerous, but for the sake of brevity I will give you the basic reasons why he's wrong. - The rocks he was examining were not part of the primordial crust of earth, but instead much younger, and therefore not reflective of earth's formation. -He does not show that polonium is the only possible cause of the ""halos."" In fact, other scientists who reviewed his work have determined that Uranium (which decays much more slowly) is the real cause. This is because the rings were most common in areas that were Uranium rich. If the cause had been Polonium, this would not have been the case. -Gentry attempts to rationalize the apparent conflict between his results and all other geological evidence for the age of earth, by proposing that decay rates have changed. There is no evidence for this, and the phenomenon is impossible according to current atomic theory. If he is right, then there is no reason that Polonium decay rates couldn't have changed as well, and therefore his entire conclusion is baseless-His theory requires at least three instances of divine intervention. Science does not deal with the supernatural.Then why have fossilized whales been found standing vertically on their tails?What does this have to do with anything? I don't know specifically what your talking about, however, if I were to speculate this could be because either rocks containing the fossils were pushed vertically by volcanic or tectonic activity, or that an underwater avalanche buried a whale vertically. Until you show me specifically what your talking about though, these are just guesses.Why are the layers of coal formations connected?Once again, I'm not sure what your talking about.Out of the billions of fruit flies/bacteria generations observed, why have they only produced after their kind?I assume by kind you mean species. If that is the case, then you are severely mistaken. There are numerous examples of observed speciation, especially among bacteria. In fact, in 1975, a strain of bacteria was found that could digest nylon. Nylon was only invented in 1935, so this was obviously an evolved trait. Fruit flys have also been observed in laboratories to evolve. In addition we see bugs evolving all the time, to become resistant to pesticides. If you want more examples of instances of observed speciation look here.Why is the age of the earth severely limited?: The moon is moving away from the earth each year, and would have been touching earth 1.3 billion years ago; long before then lunar tides would have wiped out life. Earth's spin is slowing down, so less than a million years ago it would it have been going much too fast for anything to survive (centrifugal force, 5,000 mph winds).Your figures are out of date. The whole, moon touching the earth 1.3 billion years ago, was a problem in the 1960s. Since then, newer and more accurate models of the earth-moon system put the moon a good distance away from the earth 4 billion years ago. Scientists had to take into account how shifting landmasses on earth (due to tectonic activity) had an effect on the moon's movement.Your second claim is laughable. I don't really know how to answer you other than to say that it's not true. Yesterday the temperature was one degree colder than today. Does that mean I can conclude there as an ice age less than a year ago? The earth is slowing down, but not nearly in the way that you described.Okay, now that that's over with we can talk about evidence for evolution.Out of all the claims, I've never heard any solid evidence to support themI'd say that's probably because creationist blogs don't have much information on the topic. I however do. Let's break it up into a couple catagories:FossilsScientists have been able to date fossils that are millions of years old, using numerous different techniques. What we see, when we look at the fossils we've found is a very clear representation of the evolutionary tree of life. Scientists have found literally thousands of transitional fossils, and not a single fossil has not fit within what evolution predicts. There were no mammals found during the Precambrian period, and no dinosaurs that dated less than 50 million years ago.If evolution were not true then how could you explain:1) How every dating technique used to identify the age of the fossils, turned up the same result? and how all of these results were consistent with evolutions predictions?2) How these transitional fossils exist?Observed instances of speciationAs I said earlier in the debate, we can actually see species evolving. The reason that the flu vaccine must be updated every year, is because the flu virus evolves each year. In this case, our knowledge of evolution actually saves people's lives. So you must ask yourself:3) If evolution isn't true, then why do we still see things evolving?I could go on, but this argument is already too long. If you have more questions go ahead and ask, but I'm much more interested in answers."	AGAINST

4887	creation	is a common creationist position which misunderstand that most mutations are mostly neutral, few are strongly detrimental and some are beneficial. Now remember that the definition of the effect of mutations depends strongly on the environment, and that what is beneficial or detrimental or neutral in one environment can take on a different 'shape' in another environment.In general, mutations or more commonly known as variations, are incredibly important for evolution, since without such variation, evolution would not be able to do much of anything. So, in fact, variation is an important component to evolutionary theory and mutations are one way of variation to increase, but other mechanisms such as recombination can also increase the variation in the species by mixing and matching parts of genomes.This is one reason why Behe's claims about the edge of evolution are so poorly supported by fact and theory. Behe argues for instance that evolution is unable to explain two or more mutations because he insists that they have to happen at the same time. His argument is that intermediates do not exist and if they do, they do not have any beneficial advantage and thus are impervious to selection. So let's explore this with an example in which a mutation A and B are necessary for a particular beneficial event to happen (such as malaria resistance) and lets assume that A and B by themselves have near neutral fitness contributions in a particular environment. In Behe's world, this would mean that a population either has AB mutation or neither A nor B. However in reality, we know that populations exhibit a significant variability in which there will be some that will have a mutation A and others a mutation B but since these mutations are by themselves neutral, they can only spread to fixation via drift. This means small populations or a bottle neck or a selective sweep.However since A or B are already part of a subset of the population, all they need is another mutation event B or A, to suddenly expose a strongly selective advantage. The probability of such an event can be increased when A or B has come to fixation piggy backing on another selective event.Not only does this affect Behe's simplistic calculcations but in real life we actually have evidence of the existence of the many intermediates between no resistance to  to full resistance. In other words, we can observe the individual steps through which this resistance could have evolved. In other words, the suggestion that intermediates are without any selective value is shown to be erroneous.As to gene duplication and co-option, the reason why we see evolution re-using so many 'modules' is simple. Evolving a system of n components can reduce to a log(n) time when modules are re-used. So in case of 1000 components, this would reduce the time  from O(n) to O(log n) or from 10^n to n. Not a bad reduction in time would you not agree? This was what Herbert Simon argued in his early 20th century papers on complexity and modularity. And one should not be surprised that we have found at many levels of life, that scale free networks and hierarchical networks govern. 	AGAINST

I neither worship Darwin nor accept his writings as absolute truth. ID, on the other hand, may be compatible with a wide range of faiths, but they don't seem terribly interested. The only proponents of ID I've ever spoken with are Christian. If there was the presence of an Intelligent Designer, who else would it matter to? Pantheists don't care; they already think the world's workings are in harmony according to overlapping plans. Agnostics are noncommittal about the designer, not the least because there's no proof of intelligent design. So all of those meet science without presuppositions and with respect for what is real.The Abrahamic religions center most strongly around a judgemental god. If there were not the idea of judgement, would the possibility of an intelligence with the power to create life even matter?

4897	creation	"---Okay, letÕs start with how ID tries to infer design, namely by using the Design Inference. In order for something to be designed, it needs to be ÔspecifiedÕ and sufficiently ÔcomplexÕ. So what is really meant by these terms? Specification basically means that there exists an independent description of the event or system, and as Dembski points out in biology ÔspecificationÕ is trivially met by function. So what about ÔcomplexityÕ? Unlike the more common meaning of the term, complexity in ID speak refers to something which cannot (yet) be explained by regularity and/or chance. When these requirements are met, a design inference is triggered. In other words, a design inference bascially states that something functional whose origin we do not (yet) understand and is thus specified and complex, is also ÔdesignedÕ. Or to use Del RatzschÕs description: Design is the Òset theoretic complement of the disjunction regularity-or-chance. Ò. This clearly qualifiies as an argument from ignorance, also known as a Ôgap argumentÕ.So far so good, Intelligent Design is inferred based on our ignorance not because of what we know. So how do ID activists make the claim that ID is based on Ôpositive evidenceÕ? After all, it seems self evident that ID cannot make any predictions or that it is based on Ôpositive evidenceÕ. After all, without knowing the intentions or capabilities of the Designer, how can one make any predictions? Anything goesÉ---As to the scientific vacuity, Ryan Nichols states it best--Ryan Nichols--In my argument against Intelligent Design Theory I will not contend that it is not falsifiable or that it implies contradictions. IÕll argue that Intelligent Design Theory doesnÕt imply anything at all, i.e. it has no content. By ÔcontentÕ I refer to a body of determinate principles and propositions entailed by those principles. By ÔprincipleÕ I refer to a proposition of central importance to the theory at issue. By Ôdeterminate principleÕ I refer to a proposition of central importance to the theory at issue in which the extensions of its terms are clearly defined. IÕll evaluate the work of William Dembski because he specifies his methodology in detail, thinks Intelligent Design Theory is contentful and thinks Intelligent Design Theory (hereafter ÔIDTÕ) grounds an empirical research program. Later in the paper I assess a recent trend in which IDT is allegedly found a better home as a metascientific hypothesis, which serves as a paradigm that catalyzes research. IÕll conclude that, whether IDT is construed as a scientific or metascientific hypothesis, IDT lacks content.--Source: Ryan Nichols, ""Scientific content, testability, and the vacuity of intelligent design theory"", The American Catholic philosophical quarterly, 2003, vol. 77, no4, pp. 591-611From my contribution at         "	AGAINST

Design fails to place ÔdesignÕ at risk.  This is partially true.  If and when the arguments are answered, such as how DNA evolved, the flagellum, etc., then the ID argument becomes weaker and weaker, as it should.  The reverse should also be true.  Until that time many of itÕs arguments seem to be the most reasonable inference based on the evidence as we understand it today. 4.  How can ID be tested?

Here, I want to discuss the matter of teaching and discussing intelligent design and whether this is constitutional or not.So what about intelligent design and the US Constitution?  Is it too religious?  Is it scientific?  Well, I hate to break it to the scientists here, but lawyers, judges, and constitutional law scholars don't care if something is scientific.  What they do use to judge whether a statute (claimed to be religious) is constitutional or not is the Lemon Test, a test that was born out of the 1971 case Lemon v. Kurtzman.  The Lemon Test brings a three-prong test to the debate.  They are:1. The statute must have a secular purpose.2. The statute must not have the primary purpose of advancing or inhibiting any religion.3. The statute must not result in the ""excessive entanglement"" between government and religion.If the statute fails any one of the three prongs, it fails the test.  Let's see how teaching/discussing intelligent design in public schools stacks up.1. Secular Purpose.  Note that this calls for the statute to have a secular purpose.  It does not ban the statute from having a religious purpose, it merely requires a secular one.  Does teaching/discussing ID have a secular purpose?  It has many.  For example, discussing ID can help students expand horizons.  It teaches students to think critically.  There are many others.  I remember in the eighth grade, when we had to learn about the Moon Hoax as a part of science class.  Whether it was right or wrong, whether it was wise to teach it, is all up for debate.  But it IS constitutional to discuss it in science class.2. Advancing and Inhibiting Any Religion.  It's hard to argue that teaching or discussing intelligent design advances any one religion.  After all, every religion (except for secular humanism, which the Supreme Court ruled as a religion in Torcaso v. Watkins) subscribes to the idea that life on earth was designed.  As for inhibiting religion--to make this case, you would have to argue that teaching or discussing intelligent design resulted in a ban on teaching or discussion evolution.  I don't see that happening.  In fact, the Discovery Institute has opposed measures to remove evolution from science curricula.  ID-proponents believe that evolution needs to be taught.  In fact, ID-proponents believe that all of evolution should be taught--both strengths AND weaknesses.  That is critical analysis--which, contrary to what evolutionists may say, is quite different that teaching creationism.  (How they confuses thinking critically with teaching creationism, I don't know.)3. Excessive Entanglement.  This is a tricky matter because it is difficult to pinpoint which circumstances would dictate excessive entanglement.  However, the ACLU mentioned one possible scenario in their brief submitted to Judge Jones.  They claim that if ID was presented in class and a student asked ""who was the designer?"" there is nothing that prevents the teacher from saying ""God.""  There are a few problems with this.First, as it stands now, there is nothing that prevents the teacher from saying ""God created all of you.""  Of course, he or she could be fired, but you could also fire them after answer ""God"" to the question of who is the designer.  Second, the teacher could just as well say ""we won't discuss that in class"" instead of answering ""God.""  Again, as things stand now, there's nothing to stop a student from raising his or her hand and saying ""I don't believe in evolution, I believe God made us.""  If this happens, we are in the same boat.  Finally, the ACLU claims that the teachers in Dover (and across America) don't want ID in their classroom.  They claim that these teachers are evolutionists.  If this is the case--then someone please explain to me why they would answer ""God"" to the question ""who was the designer?""  It doesn't make any sense.So in sum, no, a statute on teaching or discussing intelligent design leads to excessive entanglement between government and religion.  It engages religion less than a discussion on the reformation does in a history class.All in all, teaching or discussing intelligent design in a public school science class is not unconstitutional.  It passes all constitutional tests.  Again, it is important to remember that the question at hand is one dealing with the US Constitution.  It is a matter of law, NOT science.  The AUSCS began and ended their piece talking about ID on shaky scientific grounds.  It is no wonder they believe ID to be unconstitutional--they are using scientific methods to measure the constitution."	FAVOR
4923	creation	"In order to better understand Intelligent Design, it is important to appreciate how it abuses and conflates terminologies. For instance, ID claims that science is unable to explain 'design' and yet it appeals to science being able to explain design as evidence that ID has content.Let's look at the argument in more detail:---ÒIn all irreducibly complex systems in which the cause of the system is known by experience or observation, intelligent design or engineering played a role [in] the origin of the system.Ó ---Now remember that complexity refers to our absence to understand how to explain something, and that the statement basically states that ""when we do not understand something"" and it is 'irreducible' then it must be designed. However, we do know that natural pathways to irreducibly complex systems exist, of course, since these pathways are natural, the complexity disappears. However, the same applies when we provide a design explanation.In order for the design inference to be reliable, ID has to be able to show that there are no false positives. And yet we know that historically, people have erroneously assigned design and designers to thunder and lightning, disease, natural disasters, solar eclipses and so on, so the claim that design inferences are reliable is flawed. Now, the mere fact that design inferences are not reliable, does not mean that science cannot use design inferences reliably. But for that science assigns a plausible positive hypothesis which can compete with other explanations. For instance in criminology we look at means, motives and opportunities, combined with eye-witnesses, alibis and physical evidence to generate a plausible hypothesis which can establish ""beyond reasonable doubt"" the guilt or innocence. These forms of design as known as regular design as opposed to rarefied design. In an excellent paper Wilkins et al explain the differences (1)--he second way that the inconsistency can be resolved is as we have already indicated, by recognizing a distinction between ordinary design and rarefied design. For those events where our background information includes information about how agents or processes produce events of high probability, we would assign those to the HP category and explain them with reference to regularity. This would preserve a place for a class of rarefied design in the Explanatory Filter, but Dembski's earlier arguments about design indicating agent causation because his Explanatory Filter captures our usual means of recognizing design would only apply to the class of ordinary design, not the desired rarefied design. It is only by the attempt to inconsistently treat agent causation as a privileged hypothesis that Dembski can (erroneously) claim that ordinary design and rarefied design share a node on the Explanatory Filter.--In other words, instances of rarefied design, since they cannot really compete with the ""we don't know"" explanation, cannot be assigned the category of 'design'.Notice how ID manages by bait and switch to claim both that ID provides an alternative explanation to scientific explanations as well as that ID uses the same scientific approaches as science to make its case. Needless to say, it is trivial to point out the inherent contradiction and show that because of this conflation, ID attempts to claim that it uses similar approaches to science to infer design. However, even a cursory scrutiny of their claims quickly reveals that ID relies not on a scientific approach of providing positive explanations and hypothesis, but rather on elimination and since they refuse to present any way to constrain their designer and thus the design, they are unable to compete with our ignorance.Needless to say, science has found that such simple mechanisms as regularity and chance can in fact increase information and complexity and create what is called in ID parlance ""specified complexity"" in the same manner as ID claims that 'designers' can create such complexity.Finally, it is worth pointing out that ID refuses to admit that there exists a theory which outcompetes their preferred 'single designer' thesis, and shows that a hypothesis of ""multiple designers"" explains the data much better. The unwillingness and inability to address even the simple alternative, shows that ID is more concerned about its religious position than about science.Ask yourself: What has ID done in a non trivial manner, that increases our scientific understanding in a positive manner? Nothing, in fact, it has attempted to downplay scientific knowledge, misrepresent scientific findings, to further its case. More on the latter part in a future contribution.(1) Wilkins, John S, and Wesley R Elsberry. 2001. The advantages of theft over toil: the design inference and arguing from ignorance.

Their asserted purposes are a sham, and they are accordingly unavailing, for the reasons that follow.We initially note that the Supreme Court has instructed that while courts are ""normally deferential to a State's articulation of a secular purpose, it is required that the statement of such purpose be sincere and not a sham.""

Although as noted Defendants have consistently asserted that the ID Policy was enacted for the secular purposes of improving science education and encouraging students to exercise critical thinking skills, the Board took none of the steps that school officials would take if these stated goals had truly been their objective. The Board consulted no scientific materials. The Board contacted no scientists or scientific organizations. The Board failed to consider the views of the District's science teachers. The Board relied solely on legal advice from two organizations with demonstrably religious, cultural, and legal missions, the Discovery Institute and the TMLC. Moreover, Defendants' asserted secular purpose of improving science education is belied by the fact that most if not all of the Board members who voted in favor of the biology curriculum change conceded that they still do not know, nor have they ever known, precisely what ID is. To assert a secular purpose against this backdrop is ludicrous.---Which is why the Judge concluded in his section on ""Is Intelligent Design Science""--Judge Jones--To conclude and reiterate, we express no opinion on the ultimate veracity of ID as a supernatural explanation. However, we commend to the attention of those who are inclined to superficially consider ID to be a true ""scientific"" alternative to evolution without a true understanding of the concept the foregoing detailed analysis. It is our view that a reasonable, objective observer would, after reviewing both the voluminous record in this case, and our narrative, reach the inescapable conclusion that ID is an interesting theological argument, but that it is not science.--Of course ID proponents are quick to raise the demarcation argument while failing to recognize that while it may be hard to define strict rules as to what is and is not science in advance, it is quite possible to recognize that ID fails to be scientifically relevant a posteriori."

Human design is impossible without the designer understanding something about the existents he's designing with else he's not designing. At minimum he's juxtoposing entities at a certain time and place, in a certain orientation, which, itself is a form of design requiring human thought, a human able to act, and the ability to separate those entities from others by distinguishing their fixed attributes (order) from those of other existing entities.ID trys to switch the argument from design with existents---a common human activity, to a non-existing designer that designs and constructs something from nothing. The design argument is false because of this bait-and-switch as noted by other commenter.ID makes the common mistake of seeing what order and assuming that means it must have been designed. But, as I've shown, design requires order to prexist in the designer and the entities the designer designs with. Yes, new order is the result of the design, but that's how we distinguish what was designed or not. Not whether it has order, but whether it's possible for a human to have created it---designed and construct it.	AGAINST
4933	creation	Yes, I understand we didn't evolve from chimps from the position of   evolution   theory - and I'm sorry for saying it that way considering I truly don't want to encourage the misinformation and typical uninformed view. You never addressed any of the sea anemone info.. my point is - if we have a 'common ancestor' the more we look at the info.. the only common ancestor we could have is an amoeba - and we would have lost common ancestry at that point.  Why? Because of the cambrian explosion - which shows that at one moment (5 million years or so) nearly every phylum appeared.'Geologically speaking, 5 million years represents a mere 0.11 percent of EarthÕshistory. As Chinese paleontologist Jun-Yuan Chen has explained, Òcompared with the 3-plus-billion-year history of life on earth, the period [of the explosion] can be likened to one minute in 24 hours of one day.''''Cambrian rocks display about half (or more) of the basic body plans or architectural designs of theanimal kingdom.''''Representatives of nineteen of the forty known animal phyla definitely make their first appearance in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion. Three phyla appear in the Precambrian. Six animal phyla first appear in the fossil record after the Cambrian period, and twelve more are notrepresented in the fossil record.'' and my sidenote:  Keep in mind that the six phyla that appear 'after' the cambrian could always be moved earlier in the record if we find earlier examples... This is the failure of fossils. - for example.. if I find a cat skeleton in the earth... It only tells me that they existed in this form at that time... it doesn't tell me that they didn't exist in that form EARLIER in the record..  Though we have found that roughly half of the phyla and many subphyla first appeared in the cambrian - that doesn't rule out that all of the phyla could with further research be proven to appear in this 5 million year period.  A mere 6 phyla are currently shown to not...this concept is also stated in the paper as:'many paleontologists think that almost all of these additional eighteen phyla may well have originated during the Cambrian explosion. As Valentine, Jablonski, and Erwin argue, ÒAll livingphyla may have originated by the end of the [Cambrian] explosion.ÓThere are no transitional fossils leading up to these phylum -  a slightly exaggerated time line might appear like this:3 billion + years --) singe cell lifeforms / agae 530 million years ago --) possibly every other family of animal and plant.But this is only the original family... right? These creatures were possibly just very simple forms - so what's it matter?.... not at all.  Let's take the example of Haikouella lancelota According to Chen and his colleagues, Haikouella has many of the same features of the Yunnanozoon lividum, as well as several additional anatomical features including a Òheart, ventraland dorsal aorta, an anterior branchial arterial, gill filaments, a caudal projection, a neural cord with a relatively large brain, a head with possible lateral eyes, and a ventrally situated buccal cavity with short tentacles.ÓMany of these phyla were in the same form as they are now seen.. in other words - they appear in the record.. with no transition up - and make no further adaptations.  Many like Haikouella are extinct.This does not support evolution.. it supports some form of scientifically unexplainable creation - it implies drastic immediate change that brings about every animal and plant family.. with no sign of transition - and then relatively low amounts of change afterward.  the only thing left that disagrees with creation is the time line - which I feel is questionable due to the methods of extrapolation since it is built on assumptions.

Right now, weÕve got a bag of powerful intuitions, and a handful of notions such as Ôirreducible complexityÕ and Ôspecified complexityÕ-but, as yet, no general theory of biological design.--Paul Nelson, Touchstone Magazine 7/8 (2004): pp 64 Ð 65.More recently, godfather of ID, lawyer Phil Johnson has stated--I also donÕt think that there is really a theory of intelligent design at the present time to propose as a comparable alternative to the Darwinian theory, which is, whatever errors it might contain, a fully worked out scheme. There is no intelligent design theory thatÕs comparable. Working out a positive theory is the job of the scientific people that we have affiliated with the movement. Some of them are quite convinced that itÕs doable, but thatÕs for them to proveÉNo product is ready for competition in the educational world.--Michelangelo DÕAgostino ""In the matter of Berkeley v.

The general public uses the word ""theory"" to describe an assumption, something that may or may not be true, something not proved. Science however, uses it in quite a different context. ""Theory"" for science is the explanation of how something works. Not an assumption of how it may work, but a thorough and well examined explanation of how it works. Nothing is given the status of a ""theory"" in science unless it has been tested over and over and over again and proved by other sciences and observation. Take gravity for example. There is the Law of Gravity, which says that things tend to fall downward. Then there is the Theory of Gravity, which explains what Gravity is, what causes it, and how it works. Its not an ""assumption"" of how it works. Its a proved explanation of it. I have come across many religious people that see evolution as a threat to what they believe. They say it contradicts the theory that God created man. But at no point has the theory of evolution ever claimed to know WHO created the building blocks or the why.

For example, we can predict that Tom CruiseÕs next movie will be an action flick, but we cannot predict the plot of the movie before he agrees to a part.ÒWhere does evolutionary theory say that it will be slow or gradual? Evolution has been observed to act very quickly, sometimes over the course of decades.ÓIt is true that evolution (  change   over time) has been observed to act quickly, but the theory of evolution has from day one predicted that this change has always occurred step-by-step.  The first time this prediction was made using the theory of evolution was in the Origin of Species.  However, the Cambrian Explosion demonstrated this prediction to be false even before random natural processes wrote the Origin of Species.ÒSpecified complexity? Can you qualify that further?ÓSpecified complexity describes any sort of pattern.  Some patterns are specific but not complex (eg., gtgtgtgtg).  Some patterns are complex but not specific (eg., ctaagtcg).  Some patterns are both specific and complex (eg., gattaca).ÒLike the bacteria flagellum...ÓExactly.  Ken Miller has claimed to have tested a supposedly untestable claim, a claim that is supposedly religious and has nothing to do with   science  .ÒYou mean the Lenski long term evolution experiment?...ÓThe Lenski study did not show e. coli changing into a different species of bacteria via undirected processes.  The bacteria began as e. coli and ended as e. coli.  Even if e. coli did change into a different species, the study would not justify inferring that all life changes into new species via non-intelligent processes.Concerning the paper published in Science, the author claimed that ID is untestable immediately after claiming that it had been tested and refuted.  This contradiction was ignored by the reviewers and editors of the journal.  ÒCan you show one recorded demonstration of intelligent design in action? One scientific study that would show the manipulation of a designer?ÓI could remind you of many examples of homo sapiens intelligently altering organisms, but I cannot show you a non-homo sapien live and in-person designing anything.

(*emphasis* added)So ID first hypothesizes that CSI implies design, and then concludes that the CSI in biology implies design.  But this is nothing but a restatement of the hypothesis!  What ID forgets to do is to confirm their hypothesis, and somehow empirically support the claim that CSI necessarily implies conscious planning.  ID never even tries to do this.  Instead, ID attempts to make an induction from a single data point, arguing that since human beings can build complex machines and humans are conscious, then everything which can build complex machines must be conscious.  But one data point is not sufficient to induce the characteristics of all possible ""intelligent agents"", and so there is no justification for suggesting the cause of biological complexity (whatever it might have been) was a conscious entity.  One could, by the exact same reasoning, argue that everything which can build complex machines must have large, complex, biological brains.  But this would mean ID can't account for the *origin* of biological complexity after all.So ID does not use the scientific method to infer anything at all.  It merely assumes that all CSI must come from conscious minds because we humans can create it too, which is a perfectly unscientific argument."	AGAINST

4962	creation	ID is offered as an explanation for the complexity of life on Earth, which, according to ID proponents, cannot be explained by random chance and survival of the fittest.  But ID suffers a fatal flaw.  If we have to hypothesize an intelligent designer to explain life, then we need to hypothesize another intelligent designer to explain that intelligent designer, which also could not have come about from random chance.  We then need to explain the second intelligent designer with a third, and so on ad infinitum.  There are only two ways to end this infinite regression. First we could accept that intelligence and complex life CAN come about by random chance, and that the first intelligent designer in this regression did exactly that.  But if we do this, then why not just accept that WE came about by random chance and avoid the need for any regression?  Second, we could hypothesize a supernatural god that did not need to be designed by a previous intelligent designer (maybe god is a self-designing designer?).  But if we do this, then ID clearly becomes a religious argument, something ID proponents in this debate have denied. At this point no one can explain how life/intelligence formed on this planet.  But human ignorance does not constitute evidence for an even more complex and inexplicable intelligence.  Just because we can't explain something doesn't mean it can not be explained.  Sid	AGAINST

4970	creation	And worse, during the Dover trials, the judge came to conclude that based on the evidence presented---Judge Jones---We will now consider the purportedly Òpositive argumentÓ for design encompassed in the phrase used numerous times by Professors Behe and Minnich throughout their expert testimony, which is the Òpurposeful arrangement of parts.Ó Professor Behe summarized the argument as follows: We infer design when we see parts that appear to be arranged for a purpose. The strength of the inference is quantitative; the more parts that are arranged, the more intricately they interact, the stronger is our confidence in design. The appearance of design in aspects of biology is overwhelming. Since nothing other than an intelligent cause has been demonstrated to be able to yield such a strong appearance of design, Darwinian claims notwithstanding, the conclusion that the design seen in life is real design is rationally justified. (18:90-91, 18:109-10 (Behe); 37:50 (Minnich)). As previously indicated, this argument is merely a restatement of the Reverend William PaleyÕs argument applied at the cell level. Minnich, Behe, and Paley reach the same conclusion, that complex organisms must have been designed using the same reasoning, except that Professors Behe and Minnich refuse to identify the designer, whereas Paley inferred from the presence of design that it was God. (1:6- 7 (Miller); 38:44, 57 (Minnich)). Expert testimony revealed that this inductive argument is not scientific and as admitted by Professor Behe, can never be ruled out. (2:40 (Miller); 22:101 (Behe); 3:99 (Miller)).Indeed, the assertion that design of biological systems can be inferred from the Òpurposeful arrangement of partsÓ is based upon an analogy to human design. Because we are able to recognize design of artifacts and objects, according to Professor Behe, that same reasoning can be employed to determine biological design. (18:116-17, 23:50 (Behe)). Professor Behe testified that the strength of the analogy depends upon the degree of similarity entailed in the two propositions; however, if this is the test, ID completely fails. Unlike biological systems, human artifacts do not live and reproduce over time. They are non-replicable, they do not undergo genetic recombination, and they are not driven by natural selection. (1:131-33 (Miller); 23:57-59 (Behe)). For human artifacts, we know the designerÕs identity, human, and the mechanism of design, as we have experience based upon empirical evidence that humans can make such things, as well as many other attributes including the designerÕs abilities, needs, and desires. (D-251 at 176; 1:131-33 (Miller); 23:63 (Behe); 5:55- 58 (Pennock)). With ID, proponents assert that they refuse to propose hypotheses on the designerÕs identity, do not propose a mechanism, and the designer, he/she/it/they, has never been seen. In that vein, defense expert Professor Minnich agreed that in the case of human artifacts and objects, we know the identity and capacities of the human designer, but we do not know any of those attributes for the designer of biological life. (38:44-47 (Minnich)). In addition, Professor Behe agreed that for the design of human artifacts, we know the designer and its attributes and we have a baseline for human design that does not exist for design of biological systems. (23:61-73 (Behe)). Professor BeheÕs only response to these seemingly insurmountable points of disanalogy was that the inference still works in science fiction movies. (23:73 (Behe)).It is readily apparent to the Court that the only attribute of design that biological systems appear to share with human artifacts is their complex appearance, i.e. if it looks complex or designed, it must have been designed. (23:73 (Behe)). This inference to design based upon the appearance of a Òpurposeful arrangement of partsÓ is a completely subjective proposition, determined in the eye of each beholder and his/her viewpoint concerning the complexity of a system. Although both Professors Behe and Minnich assert that there is a quantitative aspect to the inference, on cross-examination they admitted that there is no quantitative criteria for determining the degree of complexity or number of parts that bespeak design, rather than a natural process. (23:50 (Behe); 38:59 (Minnich)). As Plaintiffs aptly submit to the Court, throughout the entire trial only one piece of evidence generated by Defendants addressed the strength of the ID inference: the argument is less plausible to those for whom GodÕs existence is in question, and is much less plausible for those who deny GodÕs existence.

4972	creation	"To start with with, I think the Wikipedia page:    has a good summary of the stories. Nobody, you can say you believe in the literal words, but you didn't answer the question of which words. I didn't use science or philosophy - just the plain Biblical language. In one version, man is created last. In the other, man is created far earlier - and the rest of Eden is created for him. Both put man in a primary position, but they have different orders. So if you can please resolve the difference for me without ill-mannered yelling and accusations, I would appreciate it. And if you could spell properly, that would be good also. Faith is not inconsistent with learning. As for the argument that somehow God's measurements are different form our own, why would God do that? If you follow that argument, then you need not believe ANYTHING in the Bible since it could be that God meant something beyond our understanding. If God speaks to us, then he must use the words we can understand or we cannot be expected to heed them.However, if there is one consistent thing in faith, it is that everybody who has experienced God puts it beyond words or human comprehension. When Isiah cried 'Holy, Holy, Holy', perhaps a better translation would be 'Other. Other, Other'. He was using holy as the opposite of profane - the day to day versus the beyond human understanding. To accept this though is to accept that the Bible is a human - not divine - creation. But again, if you are to believe the Bible literally, another question is, which Bible? I have two in my house, and the modern translation is different. At the start of John, the King James speaks of the darkness not being able to comprehend the light while the other says it cannot overcome the light. Those are very different to my mind. One is conflict, the other is a separation. As I try to divine God's will, which should I use as a starting point?Of course both use the English 'word'. That is a translation from the Greek 'logos', a word for which there is no true English equivalent. Once again, Wikipedia has as good a summary as any:    Without some scholarship, no cursory reading of the passage can convey all the meanings it would have had for the author. But then much of John is different from the other gospels. Each was written for a different audience and emphasizes different aspects of Jesus. John's timeline for the events in Christ's death is factually inconsistent with the other synoptic gospels. But more important is the tenor of John. Written after the fall of the Temple, I believe John's main purpose was to establish Christianity as the legitimate successor to the only other Jewish branch to escape the 'cult of the temple' - the Pharisees. The scorn and derision heaped upon the Jews, particularly the Pharisees, seems more appropriate for discrediting a foe than loving an enemy. I am always willing to learn more. But please spare me the yelling, the putting words in my mouth, the anger that is totally inappropriate to discussing the divine. There is a Buddhist quote, ""My teaching is like a finger pointing to the moon. Do not mistake the finger for the moon."".  Too many Christians have mistaken the Bible (the finger) for the moon (the will of God). Irenaeus taught that all that was needed was faith. The laity to have faith in the deacons, the deacons to have faith in the bishops. At the same time, he declared the gnostics - who believed in finding their own truth - heretics. The Bible does have Truth in it. But I believe it is the truth of art, of emotion, and of the human condition. Fact and history as we accept them didn't even exist when the Bible was written. For a very interesting commentary on the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament to us Christians), you might go to:      The course looks at the Hebrew Bible from the standpoint of what it meant to those who wrote it. It provides context and depth. And it does cover some of the creation story in addition. "	AGAINST

In an obvious attempt to shed any reference to God, delegating Him to an irrelevant role, ID has attempted to circumvent the rulings of law. And it has not worked, because ID is based on the same flawed arguments that doomed creationism (sudden appearance is still an essential component) and the argument is that ID cannot distinguish between the natural and the supernatural.

Has Behe admitted that his inference for design was flawed? Has he admitted the impact of such falsification on ID? Of course not.

(Let me make PERFECTLY clear, this is all I am discussing.)  He simply offered his conclusion; because cellular machinery is complex, it is designed.  He offers no evidence, no data, and no sembelence of a coherent argument.--The evidence is everywhere its just a matter of where you want to put your faith. --Science != faith.  Faith !=scienceThe evidence is NOT everywhere.  The DATA is everywhere.  Evidence is data that is used to support your hypothesis, which makes predictions of future experimental results, or data that will be discovered at a later date.Behe offers no DATA to support his hypothesis; which make no predictions.  ID does not meet the criteria to be a theory, it barely meets the criteria to be an unfinished hypothesis.	AGAINST
4984	creation	Is good science a 'liberal' theme? If you love true science, you must be a liberalYou are in good company but remember that good science, including evolutionary science knows no boundaries, Christians, republicans, democrats and independents all accept the facts of science, of course given the historical link between evangelicals and republicans we do observe a stronger lack of understanding of science amongst some who also happen to be republicans but do not confuse cause and effect here.

4986	creation	"The first point stressed in my college biology class was in fact that we as scientists cannot ascribe purpose to chemical and biological functions. One can only observe and describe the complex functions that occur in biology. I have heard theologists describe the human as a perfect being that could only be the result of an intelligent designer. The human body is far from perfect especially with regard to his physiology. The human lung is relatively inefficient and the lungs of birds are far superior in associating Oxygen with blood cells. When ID attempts to account for observable biological complexity it falls back on a designer, but if beings are the result of   intelligent design   what created the designer? Evolution attempts to explain the origin of life and the process through which current species came to manifest themselves. ID excludes the designer from the explanation for life on earth. This implies that the designer be other worldly or supernatural/martian. ID doesn't offer new evidence it merely relies on the gaps in current evolutionary knowledge. Even worse is the fact that ID and so called ""Creation Science"" have their roots in the idiotic notion that evolution contradicts the second law of Thermodynamics. "	AGAINST
4987	creation	"Behe asserts:""Design is recognized in the purposeful arrangement of parts""Who decides if an ""arrangement of parts"" is ""purposeful""?  What does ""purposeful"" really mean in that statement?  Do the parts have ""purpose""?  Does the ""arrangement"" have purpose?  Did the designer have ""purpose""?  If I take an old wristwatch and remove all the springs and gears and arrange them in a circle, is the circle designed?  If I throw them in a heap, are all of the parts of the watch no longer designed?  If I pick up some metal shavings off of the floor from under the lathe in the machine shop and arrange them into a complicated mathematical pattern that I generated using a computer program, can you tell if this is a ""purposeful design"" or just a ""random design""?Is a virus designed?  A prion?  A fragment of RNA? A benzene molecule?  How can you tell?Waving your hands and saying ""I know design when I see it"" and ""all life was obviously designed"" just won't cut it.  Your religious motives in assuming your religious designer are too obvious to allow your judgment to go unquestioned.Behe further asserts:""and the cell exhibits the most profound purposeful arrangement of parts in the universe"".There you go again, using that word ""purposeful"".  Well, it's really good ""public relations"" to appeal to religious people with such an assertion.  But scientists are unimpressed.  Maybe cells and prions and lifeforms have a ""purpose"" - to grow and reproduce and evolve - but unless you can show that there is really a ""need"" for a designer, there is no reason to assume that there was one.  So your task remains impossible - ""prove"" that evolution cannot have produced ""this"" over the last 3 billion years.  Go back 3 billion years and prove that a ""cell"" did not evolve from something simpler?  Or wave your hands and say ""I don't believe it could have happened""?"	AGAINST

Indeed, many groups, such as the National Academy of Sciences, go so far as to deny the existence of any genuine scientific controversy about the issue.160 Nevertheless, teachers should be reassured that they have the right to expose their students to the problems as well as the appeal of Darwinian theory. Moreover, as the previous discussion demonstrates, school boards have the authority to permit, and even encourage, teaching about design theory as an alternative to Darwinian evolution-and this includes the use of textbooks such as Of Pandas and People that present evidence for the theory of intelligent design.--Ironic isn't it ""Of Pandas and People"", of all books.
